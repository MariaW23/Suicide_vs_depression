Male 35 have had a boyfriend for 6 years. 5 weeks ago he dumped me. Basically‚Ä¶ he asked me to come to McDonald‚Äôs I genuinely believed it was a mini date üòê I know ‚Ä¶ classy ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è so I pick him up we go to the drive through and he has ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù his wallet. Fine I pay and after he gets his food he tells me it‚Äôs over. He has arranged a ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù with another guy for a weeks time so he was dumping me before he goes and moves on right away with him. üòê and I‚Äôve to drop him home. On the run up to this he had made all these promises that we were going to go away together and blew it off for one reason or another. I literally spend hundreds trying to organise different trips. A side note here is this guy is also my best friend. Like our lives are intertwined. So the plan was we would still be friends but I don‚Äôt believe he has any intention of actually being my friend. I still love him but rn I‚Äôm literally ready to take my own life. I feel broken that I‚Äôll never love anyone like I love him. He basically has my heart still and I feel so empty. He is supposed to be my best friend too so when you are this hurt you lean on your best friend but this guy has become so selfish over night that I feel so alone. It‚Äôs been 5 weeks now and I just want to die and never feel this pain. Idk why I‚Äôm reaching out on this I have no hope. ,0

"I usually don‚Äôt plan my suicide attempts. When I have attempted in the past it‚Äôs always for the most part been a spur of the moment thing. I am always depressed and suicidal but I push through until it gets to much. These past few months my depression has been worse than ever. I‚Äôve recently attempted suicide. I feel like if I attempt again it‚Äôll be over for me.

I‚Äôm an actor and I‚Äôve recently been accepted to a really big project for my standards. The biggest I‚Äôve ever done. And I have the most lines and everything. I‚Äôm was really excited but the past few days I‚Äôve not been. And even though it‚Äôs 100% gonna happen I‚Äôve been finding myself going ‚Äúif I do the project‚Äù instead of ‚Äúwhen‚Äù. A part of me feels like maybe I won‚Äôt. And today I got the script. Usually I‚Äôm so excited to read the whole script and I learn my lines straight away and usually have a lot of it learned in a few hours. I‚Äôve only skim read through it and even though I want to read it all and learn my lines I don‚Äôt have any motivation to at all.

Even though this is the biggest role I‚Äôve ever done and I‚Äôve never experienced this before. I think maybe this is a sign my depression is getting worse. Maybe part of me knows I‚Äôm not going to make it till the show.

My earliest memory of being depressed was... 6th grade? Middle school was brutal for a chubby girl like me. And it just never got better. I'm 27 now. Does it ever get better? I'm on meds but it feels like im drowning and can never reach the surface. ,0
In the same month I lost both my best friends I am unemployed and my small business is failing and my business partner constantly whines I swear everyday he wants to shut everything down and sell everything so my life ain't going great and am also living in my parents house and they are pretty shitty kinda makes me laugh to think about this,0
"Hello. Since I was 14 years old all my joy I had in life was to get home alone and play videogames. I've also been reading novels and I like listening to music. That's it. I have no friends and I don't want any. I have maybe one friend but when I'm with him, it's like putting on a mask and being a different person than you are.

I always only had one wish to find true love, some girl who understands me well and cares for me. But now I think this dream is impossible and I will never find someone. So what am I supposed to do now? Just go to work to get home and play videogames??? There is no person I like to be with and I can't find a girl who loves me. That's always what I wanted but I never found it. I never had a girlfriend and I'm 27 years old.

I am a very nervous and anxious person but I can hide it well. This Olanzapin drug makes me a zombie and I can do full weekend just laying in bed and sleeping. It's literally prescribed to insomnia patients, I didn't even have that. Read the reviews on [drugs.com](http://drugs.com) for olanzapin and you will be amazed what a crazed potent drug this is that I can never get rid of. It's impossible to withdraw.

And now I'm stuck in a loop going to work and getting home and I never meet anyone I don't even know where to go, and I can't go anywhere. Even if I went somewhere what is the potential that I find a special girl to care for someone like me. I am a special person and I like to be treated special. It just has to click for both of us. I'm afraid it will never happen.",0
Hey guys I'm 14 and I just wanna die people have never actually and I was told from this girl I dated for a while that she just dated me so she wasn't single people are a-holes and care only about themselves whem I've given so much and I have never seen anyone give back sometimes not even a smile I am so shattered from people's words because they just don't care and I I don't feel enough,0
"This is it. I won't be a coward again. I've been fighting for 15 years and nothing ever changed. Every single fucking day is worse than the last. I can't do this anymore.     
     
I've been diagnosed with severe depression, ADHD and Asperger's for 3 years now. I grew up in a torn and abusive household and was bullied ever since kindergarten.      
      
I've tried so damn hard for so damn long and just get beat up for it. I really just wanted to be loved. But live wouldn't even give me that. I'm so sick of this bullshit. I'm not even close to being an adult and the only fucking thing I know is pain.    
   

I wanted to die since I was a child. Honestly, I never understood why I should all of this work and effort into something I never even asked for. Just waking up every morning and coming to terms with the fact that I am actually alive, conscious and present in this world is painful on a level I can't express.   
    
I don't want this, and I never did. Life's always been nothing but a slow, boring and painful process that ultimately leads to nothing in my eyes. Every day is just a copy of the last.
     
There are no words that could convey the hatred I have for this place, for myself and everything around me. Simply being alive makes me so fucking angry. I want to die the most brutal and agonizing death I can, just to know what real pain feels like.       
        
I've never done anything for a reason. I made every choice in my life on a whim, just because I felt like it. I've done the most depraved things to myself, just for the sake of doing ANYTHING.      
         
All my therapists already gave up on me. I'm only 15 and already have been told multiple times what a hopeless case I am. I made others spiral into depression, just by talking about how I view life. I genuinely believe that I'd do the world a favor by dying.    
    
I don't deserve to be loved. I'm a thief, a liar and an addict. It's fucking pathetic. Just looking in the mirror makes me want to die.     
      
It doesn't fucking matter what I do, I always end up here, crying on the shoulders of strangers and begging for help and attention even though I don't even know what's wrong with me.    
    
      
I'm completely numb by now. Everything stopped helping. Not even drugs can make me feel good.       
         
I'm not playing this fucking game anymore.

"*(Not a regularly used account)*

I've been working in my field for 8ish years since I got out of the military. I've never really enjoyed it, but it pays bills.

Over the course of the past year, I've progressively gotten worse and worse with how I feel about my work that I'm supposed to be working right now, and I just stare at my computer in despair. The more I've done my type of work, the more I find it to be the exact type of work that makes the entire state of life in America worse (I've largely worked in finance).

When I was in the military, things at least felt like they had a purpose. Even if that purpose was just to support your brothers and sisters to your left and right. Now, when I think of needing to work in my field for 25 or 30 more years before being able to retire, I think that I would rather just be dead. I'm not going to harm myself. At least I don't think so. It's just that the thought of doing this for even another 10 years make me just feel like not even taking care of my self at all. I have plenty of life insurance. If I'm already going to not be around my family because I'm working all the time, might as well not do anything that will prolong my own suffering.

I don't know that I'll respond to this post in the future, but I needed somewhere to say how I felt if only to get my thoughts in order before I tell someone IRL like a therapist or counselor.",0
"TRIGGER WARNING: body image issues, suicidal ideation

22(f) I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, and ADHD

I don't think I have ADHD just super obsessive thoughts about traumatic things that happened to me that distract me from daily tasks. 

I'm on Wellbutrin. I also smoke nicotine. I'm jobless. Never went to college. 

My day consists of eating and sleeping and mindlessly scrolling on social media. Brain rot. Laying down in bed. Eating more food, watching videos to ""change your life"" and ""becoming elevated."" 

This must be peak depression. I also just lost my job due to a manager harassing me, he fired me on the spot when I said he makes me uncomfortable. Probably because he was afraid of me telling his boss. There goes months of hard work to get that promotion. 

Also going through a break up of a 4 year long relationship after it got extremely toxic and I noticed myself feeling happier around friends. I felt more alone than ever while being with him. I started to despise him because I started feeling like his mother, everything he did  pissed me off. I don't think he's ever felt like that towards me. Which is why I felt guilty for leaving.

Got a new boyfriend without even processing the previous breakup. I then broke up with him over jokes he had made that made me feel way more insecure than I've ever felt.   
I still love this guy, I just hate myself for not being able to take a joke. He was quite literally too perfect for me, everything I had been looking for in a partner. I could not shake the thought that he's settling for me or I'm not his real type. Though he's never said that to my face, I can already tell by the way he interacts with other women- who even I - deem more attractive than me. Everything else about him was great, it's was those slick comments and small moments that stuck with me, confirming how ugly I am. 

I broke it off due to my self esteem being majorly low and that I'll only add depression into his life. He said I can depend on him, that he'd help, but I've been in this situation before. You do so much for someone to feel better, it's never gonna fulfill them until they love themselves. I'd only be searching for validation, I wouldn't be confident or secure. 

I'm having suicidal thoughts, everything I've done has lead to failure. I lost passion in my hobbies. I'm scared to start college at my age (22 about to be 23) I fear I'm too late.

I hate my body, it's the ugliest body I've ever seen. Who'd want to fuck this? Saggy tits, no ass, wrong proportions, fat, ugly face. No amount of surgery will help, nor do I have the money for it lmao. 

No one can love and accept my body except my ex of 4 years, but I dislike him. Do we see the hypocrisy here? 

Then I fell deeply into the topic of astrology, christianity, demons, God, creator of the universe, spirituality, crystals, witches, spell casting. I don't even know who or what to believe in anymore. Thus making me even more insecure and afraid. 

My friends (5 total) think I'm funny because of how dramatic I am. That's the only thing I have going for me is my outward performance to people will have a layer of humor and unseriousness.   
I started going to the gym and it helps, but some days it gets so bad I binge eat and don't move from my bed. I try to not eat so much, I can't help it. It's the only thing that comforts me right now. 

  
TLDR// My depression is getting the best of me and I overeat to feel better. Gaining weight. I started going to the gym, but I still eat like shit and don't even move at all sometimes. Any advice to build a routine that I can follow? I know everything I said can be labeled as ""excuses"" but it's so difficult for me to get out of this funk. Please help. ",0
"I don't know what to say here really, and this is really a stream of consciousness post.  I just feel so lonely and unloved right now, and emotionally numb.  I SH'd in the past when I was like this, and it broke that deadlock of feeling dead inside.  But I felt so ashamed afterwards. That feeling is calling to me again, but I'm too scared to act and I feel pathetic and like a coward for that.

I'm autistic, but high functioning, and I have suffered from depression and anxiety for years.  I feel so lost and out of place, and so incredibly lonely.  I just want to feel something, anything, but I'm honestly terrified of to act on my thoughts.  I'm on meds for anxiety and depression, and I can't stop the thoughts of downing whatever I have left.

Going to work is such a struggle.  Having to pretend I'm OK and still perform my job is so fucking hard, and not a day goes by where I feel like quitting.

I just want to be happy and feel loved.  But I feel like that's not for me, and I'm terrified of going on like this.  I have had good moments in the past, but the bad greatly outweighs the good.  I've never been in any kind of relationship, and as a guy in his 30s I feel so infantilised because of it (in my own mind at least).

I feel shame at the thought of leaving family and the few friends I have, but also feel like I can't go on like this.  I've nothing left to give, and if I had the choice of flipping a switch, there's a very high chance I'd do it.  And I'm so scared of surviving an OD but fucking up my body.

I'm so worn of this dark and scary existence.  I  feel like I've nothing left to give, but life keeps coming at me, and I just want all the pain, fear, and sadness to go away.  When I was 17, in the depths of a suicidal depression, I made a promise to myself to just try one more day, you can end things if it doesn't work.  I've kept that promise for more than 15 years, and I'm just tired of fighting.

I'm sorry. I've tried therapy and meds, but I just don't know what I can do.

"i am an 18 year old female who has been enduring emotional and verbal abuse from my mother for almost ten years. she has no friends besides coworkers because of how hard she is to be around,  and has driven my stepfather to become an alcoholic. he is currently in rehab. i have been the one to take over the ‚Äúhead of the house‚Äù job, doing laundry, cleaning, taking care of pets, watching my little brother 24/7, occasionally cooking, and being my mother‚Äôs in house therapist. she is also having a virtual affair with her ex fianc√©, who she cheated on my dad with. 

with my stepdad gone, my mother has been even more unstable. when we went to visit him for the first time on saturday, my mother barely let me or my little brother speak to him. i gave my brother my phone so he wouldn‚Äôt be bored, which left me with nothing to do other than stare at the wall. my mom was very offended by my ‚Äúembarrassing behavior‚Äù. long story short, yesterday, tuesday, she turned off my phone, called my grandfather and told him not to pay for my college education (i made it into my dream school and was supposed to be attending this fall‚Äîmy entire life he has promised to cover the cost of attendance), forcefully took my drivers license, took my keys, and kicked me out of the house. i am not at my fathers without many of my usual toiletries or my emotional support dog. 

i tried to kill myself in 2022, but unfortunately failed. i dont see any point to living anymore. my dreams are crushed and i can no longer see my dog or little brother. i dont even have access to my own ID. my mother screamed in my face before i left, calling me an ungrateful bitch, saying that i don‚Äôt deserve anything, and telling me that she hopes i am miserable for the rest of my life. i tried texting the suicide hotline but they took too long to answer. my other family members refuse to take me into the house to grab my other belongings, but have stated that they can pick them up for me (hell, i don‚Äôt even know where everything is. i just want to see my dog). i have no friends and am completely undesirable in every way. there is no purpose left to being alive. if anyone knows a good way to die, please let me know. i am not keen on trying to overdose again because that is how i attempted last time. my therapist is busy and my psychiatrist hasn‚Äôt answered my emails. i am alone and worthless.

"I‚Äôm 27 and still live at home with my mum and dad. My abusive mum has Huntington‚Äôs disease and I‚Äôm 50% at risk of developing it, I have decided not to get tested. My dad is my best friend and I wouldn‚Äôt still be here without him. 

I have several physical health issues along with mh issues like bpd, depression, anxiety and ocd. Because of this I‚Äôm not able to work full time but I do work part time in a job that I mostly enjoy but can be very stressful at times. 

I was abused on one occasion as a child which my mum witnessed and did nothing to stop. After this we did not have a good relationship and shortly after that is when her HD symptoms started to develop. Because of what happened I have never been in a relationship, I‚Äôve never had sex, the most I‚Äôve done is kiss someone. I‚Äôve gotten help several times which helps for a while but I always go back to square one afterwards.  

Where I live it is extremely hard to get any mh support unless you pay for it yourself which I can‚Äôt afford. I have been on a mh waiting list to see someone again for 2.5 years with no answer. 

I don‚Äôt want to live anymore. I wish I could afford to move away and start a fresh life somewhere else. Nobody is going to want me being a virgin this old, having bpd and possibly having a terminal illness. The only friends I have are online and when I have tried to make friends in person, I always get ghosted or my anxiety gets too much and I end up cancelling on them. 

I have decided against ever having children because of my illnesses and situation. I‚Äôm not pretty, I‚Äôm slightly overweight, constantly exhausted from being so anxious and I‚Äôm stuck in this loop forever. I have no way out. ",0
"I don‚Äôt even think anyone would care about this suicidal asian guy but I just had to say this somewhere. I have never had good relationships with others whether it‚Äôs family or friends. Brothers were almost strangers and parents were just some kinda financial support. I moved to the states 10 years ago from south Korea and I was freshman in high school. I didn‚Äôt speak english at all thus couldn‚Äôt make any friends in school and my parents were always mad at us. I understand that. It was hard for all of us to adjust to new environment in whole different country. Of course there are more stories to tell. But my question is that, why am I only one who has borderline personality disorder, depression, and suicidal in my family.

"I‚Äôve been this way for as long as I can remember. Much of my life is spent alternating between passive acceptance of this and desperate attempts to fill it anyways. Sometimes it can be temporarily filled in good ways. Love helps. Compassion helps. My family, fianc√©e and dog help.

And yet the void remains. 

So I drink compulsively and I smoke too much because when I‚Äôm far enough gone I can forget I‚Äôm me. I do things I know are terrible for me. Because for just a little while the void is full, or at least I don‚Äôt notice its emptiness.

It‚Äôs a trap, of course. Numbing myself doesn‚Äôt help. Not really. Once I‚Äôm sober, I‚Äôm still me. Only, food tastes a little more like ashes in my mouth. Everything feels a more like I‚Äôm doing it wearing a weighted suit. I take even less joy from the good things in life. And I want another drink.

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm like this. I‚Äôve got some theories. Depression and substance abuse runs in the family. Childhood trauma possibly also plays a role. My first coherent memory is of a shooting I was in as a kid, with my mother grabbing me on her back to carry me away as quickly as possible. The sound of gunshots inside, the glare of the cheap mall lights. The dying boy bleeding out against a car. In any event, it probably didn‚Äôt help. 

I don‚Äôt think I want to die. It‚Äôs just hard to get worked up about going on living. That‚Äôs somewhat irrelevant. I‚Äôve got people who need me. People who would be hurt if I left them. A dog that adores me. 

If I was alone in this universe I‚Äôd be free not to care if I live or die. But I‚Äôm not. So we continue. 

Because besides family, friends, pets‚Ä¶there‚Äôs her.

I love her in a way I hadn‚Äôt realized I was  capable of. And she loves me. She is sweet and kind and generous and good and she loves me.

Her life hasn‚Äôt been easy. She deserved better from the abusive family she doesn‚Äôt talk to anymore. She deserves better than me. But for some reason she wants me. For reasons beyond my comprehension she loves me. And I promised her a good life, with love and a real family and the adventures she never got growing up. So I‚Äôll put in the work for her.

I will stop numbing the void and learn to accept it as part of me.

It‚Äôs going to be hard and I am afraid.

But it will be worth it. Because I love her and I want her to be happy. To be content. To take joy in life and leave it old and gray and with no regrets. And so I‚Äôll do what I can to give that to her. I will quit drinking. I will give up smoking. I will wake up every day, and I will push through the emptiness and I will protect her and make her as happy as I can for as long as I can, for as long as she wants me. Sometimes I‚Äôll be going through the motions of life. But I believe there will be moments that make me happy too. 

Or perhaps there won‚Äôt be. Not real happiness, of the kind I suspect I might have been capable of if I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶this. But if I can give her a joyful life lived without regrets, I will have done something worth doing with my life. And so I‚Äôll focus on that. And the next time I want a drink, and every time after that, I‚Äôll think about her and do my best to remind myself why I can‚Äôt.

I expect to always be depressed. But I think I can create space to exist within it, to make my peace with it. I can choose to feel the pain instead of numbing myself to it. And I will. My life is worth living and has a point because I say so. No matter how hard and scary that might be. 

If some of this is striking a cord with anyone reading it, I hope you find your reason to do your best. Maybe you‚Äôll find a route to happiness through it. Hell, maybe I will. But even if not, there are still things worth doing with life. Hang in there and good luck. ",0

Now I feel more insecure and useless than ever. I feel like a waste of space and a burden. I always try to help but I make it worse and harder for everyone else. Maybe I should just stop trying. They always talk about the things wrong with me and nothing good about me. My weight, my depression, my lack of wanting to date boys, my appearance, it‚Äôs all they ever talk about. It‚Äôs the peoples around mes fault that I hate myself. If all my friends family and peers never tormented me my whole life that im fat ugly and useless maybe id have a better life and a reason to be happy. Im just so tired. I‚Äôll never be pretty enough or smart enough or hot enough. I‚Äôll never be enough. They even yelled at me about attempting suicide 4 years ago. They yelled at me about cutting when they found out. Instead of getting me help they decided to berate and torment me. I‚Äôll just never be good enough in anyone‚Äôs eyes. No matter how hard I try. ",0

"spent a few months around hospitals after a suicide attempt in 2023. 

they prescribed me venlafaxine and mirtazapine which is supposed to make me feel better, but the only changes i've noticed is i get seizures or other withdrawal symptoms if i stop taking venlafaxine, and mirtazapine just makes me tired when i take it, and when i don't i can't sleep. 

for 2 years now ive been in therapy and i get nothing done, only going there by principle.
for 2 years now i can't cry, can't laugh, can't love, can't feel anything, etc. im sure you've heard this so many times. i have just enough energy to go to school, come back to nothing, waste time, sleep. no passions, no hobbies, no interests, no desires, no skills. i hate free time because i have to be with myself and i have nothing in myself. i have become completely inhuman.

call it pessimism but i don't know what else to do. i'm seventeen years old and my life has ground to a halt. i know my whole life is ahead but if it's going to continue this way i don't know why i should stay.

"**Need To Talk / Vent**

Throwaway account. I need to express what I'm going through because I'm exhausted from living like this without anyone truly understanding. My mind is essentially in a permanently blank, withdrawn, depersonalised and dissociative slate, as if I'm watching my life as a movie, drifting through it on autopilot. Everything and everyone around me feels lifeless and foggy. I feel completely detached from my body and surroundings, as if I'm not really alive. It's hard to explain, but everything feels disconnected and distant. It's like living in a permanent state of amnesia, where I'm detached from my own body, lacking thoughts, memories, or a sense of identity like some sort of ego death that never ends. This has severely impacted my social abilities; I have nothing to say or express anymore. I feel numb, empty, and permanently withdrawn. Trying to have a simple conversation with me is like trying to get blood from a stone. I feel utterly hopeless, constantly sad, and sometimes, it feels like I'm not real.

I became very depressed about a year ago, and my cognitive abilities just dwindled overtime. I started just staying in my room all the time, sleeping and doing nothing else, and my memories started to decline, and my brain was probably not being stimulated or processing much information as it should. I feel crazy writing this. I feel completely alone, withdrawn and there's just nothing going on inside of my head anymore. Am I going crazy? Am I going I mentally insane? It took me a long time come up this post because my situation is so complicated, bizarre, and difficult to explain. I've done my best to express how I feel.

I feel completely hopeless and unable to explain my situation to medical professionals. When I try, I just sit in silence, unable to convey my problems because I'm literally zoned out of myself. I have nothing to say or express, and my mind is just empty because I'm entirely withdrawn from myself.

**Time at College**

I have fortunately been doing well at college and have been studying hard, but I can't explain anything about what I do there because I'm permanently zoned out and withdrawn the entire time I'm on campus. I am in a constant dream-like state and don't really think about anything. I don't take in or process much information while at college; I only learn when I get home and view the slides and take study notes. I do not converse or speak with others at all. I stay by myself at all times and avoid any social interaction. I am incapable of having basic conversations because absolutely nothing is happening in my mind. I have nothing to say or express, and trying to find something to say is very difficult. I can't make an effort to find something to say because my mind is an empty void.



I feel so lost and alone; I want to be like other people. It took me a long time to write this reddit post, and even as I typed, I felt withdrawn and can't really recall what I've talked about. I'm extremely depressed because I've lost my old self and memories can't find it again. I don't know what to do anymore. ",0
"i‚Äôm an upcoming senior. I have my last opportunity to take the SAT and get a decent score in a month. I have college applications to start. I have to find colleges and recommendations. 

I can‚Äôt bring myself to do what i want to do though.

I was diagnosed with moderate depression and GAD (general anxiety disorder) about a year ago. I went on Fluoxetine for about a week and then stopped. I was supposed to stay on it for a few months and go up in potency depending on how i felt but i ran out and since the pharmacist didn‚Äôt have the refills i just stopped.  

I used to think that my doctor was over exaggerating my symptoms and i didn‚Äôt have ‚Äúmoderate depression‚Äù. But i realized the medicine did help a few weeks later when i no longer felt the effects of it. But i didn‚Äôt think it was important enough to get more. Probably a bad idea.

Anyways, i used to study for the SAT like a maniac. Seriously. And i improved well but you know what they say about how the higher your score goes the harder it is to improve. Maybe it‚Äôs not as difficult and I‚Äôm just making it seem like it is to make more excuses for myself. Went from PSAT 1130 average to a 1350. Ik it‚Äôs not as great as some people but it‚Äôs something. 

My first SAT i got a 1340 and then bs‚Äôed my way for a couple months swearing ‚Äúdoing my best studying‚Äù when me and my entire family knew i wasn‚Äôt. It went up 10 points and i lost the meager energy i had left to study. 

Nowadays, i spend my time lazing around with nothing better to do. I sleep at terrible hours, wake up nearing the evening and do nothing but eat, nap, and scroll on my phone for entertainment. Don‚Äôt shower for days. Avoid meeting people. I tell myself i need to study since my last exam is coming up. 

I know that with a higher score i could get a better scholarship and save tons of money for my parents considering tuition. I want that. I don‚Äôt want to make them pay for an expensive college all out of pocket because they are determined to not take out loans or let me work a job whilst pursuing higher education.

I love my parents. With everything i have. But no matter how much my older brother tells me i have to care about my future and focus and study- I fail myself.  He‚Äôs doing it out of worry and precaution for me because he knows i won‚Äôt think about it for a second if nobody reminded me to actually put my mind to action. 

But i‚Äôm so so ashamed and guilty for how i constantly let them down. Everytime i sit down and try to put my plans to action, i half-ass it and know it won‚Äôt account for anything.

I‚Äôm not particularly suicidal or anything but i do have intrusive thoughts (which im pretty confident everyone has in their lifetime). But i think perhaps one of the reasons im so unprepared for my future is because i for some reason always assumed that i‚Äôd die due to some sort of accident or illness (not sure why, it‚Äôs just been like that) before i had to make such decisions. 

I have thoughts that go such as:

Someone: ‚Äú(Name) you have to think about where you‚Äôd like to go to college‚Äù

*It‚Äôs not like i‚Äôll live to go anyway*

Someone: ‚ÄúCollege is a big thing in your life and you‚Äôll never get that part of your life back‚Äù

 *We‚Äôre kind of all just specks on a rock in outer space i don‚Äôt think it matters that much what i do in life*

^^Basically stuff like that. I don‚Äôt intend to kill myself or self harm in any sort of ways so i don‚Äôt exactly understand the deal with thinking i‚Äôll die super well. In fact i look forward to the idea of marrying someone i love and having a great family with them. That is, if i find someone who‚Äôll love me enough to want to marry me.

I‚Äôm thinking of asking my dad to get me an appointment or whatever it is that i need to do to get back on the medication in hopes it‚Äôll make me happy enough to enjoy the idea of putting in the work to study and purse a better score with all the benefits?

Sometimes the shame and guilt eats me alive so much that it chips away at me in random times of the day. Sometimes all i can do to force myself to sleep to avoid the pain it‚Äôs giving me. Sometimes i just want to cry for the rest of my day. Or sometimes i just don‚Äôt care enough to think about it again. I‚Äôll tell you what, the later is **quite** rare.

This seems like a vent, but i genuinely do want advice.",0
"

I was in a mental hospital for 2 and a half weeks a few years ago where I wasn‚Äôt allowed to sleep without a light being shined on me every 10 minutes to make sure I wasn‚Äôt committing suicide and wasn‚Äôt allowed to go outside. I was also put under many different types of drugs to try to find one that worked and was sleeping next to homeless drug addicts in a bunk. I honestly don‚Äôt think it helped at all and I truly think it made things worse and I still have nightmares about it til this day.  My depression and anxiety has been off the charts lately and it‚Äôs getting really difficult to imagine myself 5 years from now. Has anyone had a similar experience experience?",0
Someone who I thought was a friend and an advocate basically kicked my hand down when I reached out for help and I really don't know if I can make it through to the end of the week. There's no one else I can reach out to who will actually respond.,0
"I don't know whether to call it depression because it's not as extreme, I'm sure if it'd even count as a clinical depression. I can function normally but there's just something melancholic or sad about me. 
Ofcourse there have been happy moments but none of them have ever felt intense or ever had any long lasting impacts. I've been feeling this dullness since I was 13-14. 

I think there's a name for it, I remember reading the first few pages of ""I want to die but I want to eat tteokbokki"", the author describes her experience of battling with depression, I resonated with her alot. 
As she shared she always had this feeling of ""blue"" but that never stopped her from functioning normally. 

I feel the same, I can do anything but everything is so dull. Sure there are some happy moments, it's not like I never laugh or enjoy, but they're just not enough to convince me to like life. Which defeats the purpose of that advice depressed people get "" enjoy every single moment"" or something like that...It doesn't work for me, life as a whole doesn't seem worth living 

i

hobbies are rarely fun, it's like out of 100 days of reading there would be 1 day where I'd actually fully enjoy it. I'm constantly bored, even art doesn't seem fun.

 I can't feel happy with people most of the time, I thought going out would help. I do crave people, but when I get the opportunity to be with them it doesn't feel special,or good as I was expecting it would. I yearn for company all for nothing 

i was wrong ,it didn't. I was miserable while everyone was taking pictures, I was contemplating how many bones I'd break if I jump from the 2nd floor of the restaurant or repeatedly banging my head against the wall.
It was a  nice restaurant, I liked the food, everyone else was having fun. I wasn't, it showed even in the group pictures I was in.

I have no ""gusto(?)"" for anything. it's like ""ok, this thing feels nice."" but there's nothing special about it. I could watch some memes and that will feel as exciting as doing my interest which I'm supposed to enjoy. 


I get jealous of people who genuinely love their hobbies, you can always see their eyes twinkling and face becoming excited. they look so full with life. 


I on the other hand, am always so monotonous, not only does it bother me it also bothers my sister who wants to have fun with me. 

I feel bad for being this way, I know I shouldn't compare but like my life isn't that bad. sure I didn't have some things but I feel like shit for being sad when my own sister has 100x much worse than me. I'm not the one who was heavily neglected or has tons of health issues that crippled her from getting education and living her life then why am I so sad? 



I don't get it, I'm so frustrated. why are my emotions so dull, why do they feel so far away? I feel mad at myself for not fully living because these memonts will pass away, I will graduate from university in a year and I'll probably never meet these people ever again. ",0
"I just woke up. Wish I could have slept forever. But it's hard with the daylight in the window and the noise of vehicles on the road. Sleep seems like the only escape left for me, just like it was two years ago. But it's not a solution. The moment I woke up, I had a panic attack, and I couldn't think of anything else other than ending it for good. How long can I keep doing this? Mother thinks I'm studying for my degree. All day I do nothing but compulsively try to soothe myself, to no avail. Soon I'll start burning with anxiety, and next come the crying spells. I don't want to live like this. Dying terrifies me though. Nothing in this life feels easy for me; not even dying. Still, I can sense the moment drawing closer and closer.",0

I'd really like to be able to prolong this to see how far I can go and if I can heal from all this so that I can build a better life together with the one I love.

I spent 9 years away from my cousins and when I saw them again a few days ago, I saw how much they had evolved with their lives and I was completely saddened, distressed and without expectations, one of my cousins is already getting married and building her family, the other is already working with what she likes and will probably find someone who loves her too.

As for me, how can I put it? Things aren't going so well, you know? Haha... I've been waiting for something good to happen to me for seven years, but I'm not getting my hopes up.

I feel like I'm being pushed to the edge of an abyss. Depression has destroyed everything I had left, the only good memories have become remnants, a figure in the fog of my memories,  

So I decided to make an album and take some photos to remind me of some landscapes and moments that were somewhat comforting for a while, even if they only mean something to me, I would like to revisit these photos in the near future before I leave, at least to remember my old self


Oh God help me, I can't take it anymore, let me go",0

I've been off my antidepressant for a few weeks because the doctor's office didn't tell me when I needed to come back in to get it renewed. Add to that the implosion of one of my closest friendships. Due to the way that spun out of control, I'm isolating myself from my other friends because now my CPTSD is screaming that I can't trust them and I don't deserve them any way.

"Hello (14M), growing up as a child who has adhd and living in an unsafe environment with plenty of kids, even adults making fun of me. Here, my abusive and alcoholic dad who physically abused me because of my disabilities has ruined my brain permanently.

He went to rehab for 2 years back in 2020... When he got back i thought it was over now... Till he cheated on my mom... And when she found out... She confronted her...

They fought... Infront of me... We were eating dinner that time... They don't even know i was there... It's just screaming and yelling... As i eat...

They didn't get a divorce... Instead they just lived in our house without talking to each other... Some other fights along the way...

They eventually sort it out and decided to live in a much safer area... I was extremely happy that time when i heard that I'll be leaving the place I almost died on...

When we moved... I made plenty of friends along the way and even went in a band... I hit puberty there... It was good... The place is quiet... It's a safe place for me... if only I can live there for the rest of my life... I can't tho...

2 years had passed, 2024. Turns out that my parents are going to sell the house and we need to go back from that shitty place I used to live on...

My whole world shattered... My stomach dropped... All the healing I did... Gone in a blink of an eye... I begged for them not to do it but they did... I wished it was dream... My friends... My school... My home... They took it away from me...

When we got back to our house... I get frequent flashbacks from the past... It felt so uncomfortable... It felt... Scary... I can't believe I'm back here... Even the school i transferred to... It's haunted... I'm scared of what's going to happen to me here...

Present day, i don't go out anymore... I drown myself on caffeine... Like energy drinks and coffee... I only go out when I have to... Like school, buying stuff from the grocery... I sometimes wish i was dead already and if i should just end it all... I think I'm doing a pretty good job of doing things that could kill me... Like drinking as much energy drinks asi can... not sleeping for 3 days... sleeping in the bathroom... but these doesn't do its job... I'm still fine... 

I go and tried to change the look of my room... And threw out the things that reminded me of the past... But I still get it... My mind is going crazy... This is torture for me... The only way I can interact to my friends is through online...i really miss them... I cry almost every night... It's my 5th month here... 

I got myself my first girlfriend... But that didn't end well and I just got mad at her suddenly and started calling her names and other hurtful stuff... I regret doing that... I didn't know why I even did that... I just came out of me... We only got together for 2 months and my unstable sense of self has led me to push her away... And regret it 3 hrs after when it's too late...

I failed almost every of my class but still manage to be able to go through the next school year... Next week I will be in 10th grade now...

I'm aching just to feel like home... Back to where i belong... I didn't know that... Happiness is temporary... But you can't force yourself to be happy... You have to find what makes you happy... But I can't... 

Writing this got a lot out of my chest... ",0
"I'm suicidal, I'm tired of being kicked out of my motel room everyday bc I'm slacking funds, I'm tired of using any donations on the room and leaving me nothing to use for food. I'm tired!!! I just need $60 to get into my room and I can't make it I only have 0 minutes before my time is up and someone takes over my room and now I have to sleep outside.

"I am just so sick and tired of everything, I can't find interest in anything. Every single thing about this world and the people in it and this strange life and society we have created is bumming me out. 

I don't know myself like this. I have struggled with depression for a long time but there was always something I was striving for. I was always obsessing over something that must be the reason for my depression, for example the fact that I am not an actress even though I have wanted to be for my whole life. I would watch countless of interviews and movies and analyse them and I would still not be able to take action myself but at least I would constantly be able to tell myself, it's because of this, if you just reach that you will be happy. (I know it doesn't actually work like that, but it was just always something to keep me going, like dangling gold in front of myself somewhere just out of reach.)

But there is nothing, nothing I want, nothing I can imagine that could possibly make life feel worth it. Even self-destructive thoughts or things summon nothing. Whether I think of positive or negative things, nothing summons up anything at all. I want to cry because it's terrible feeling nothing but I can't even do that because I don't feel enough to cry. 

I feel like I have to do something, make a big change or something to get me out of this and get me to feel anything at all about life but I don't know how when I don't care for anything. Even if I think of travel, which I have the opportunity to do and have wanted to do for a long time, it just seems meaningless and a lot of trouble and effort and actually pain as I would be doing yet another thing that I thought would make me happy and that doesn't. Just taking my misery to another place in the world.",0
"I can‚Äôt think of any other instance where I felt good about myself besides this very brief two year period in high school. I didn‚Äôt always hate myself, but I surely didn‚Äôt love myself either. I don‚Äôt believe in self worth, worth is something that I feel has to be assigned to me. I‚Äôm not sure if the issue is not getting enough compliments or praise as a child by my parents, or just that I‚Äôve always been a bit of a cynical person. If my parents tell me that I‚Äôm handsome or smart, of course they‚Äôd say that. They‚Äôre my parents. It doesn‚Äôt mean anything to me when it‚Äôs coming from family. Although I probably shouldn‚Äôt say that because in the brief period that I did actually have a bit of self confidence, that‚Äôs when coincidentally I‚Äôve heard my mother say that I looked handsome for the first time. I lost a lot of weight in high school and the girls took notice. Since elementary school, I‚Äôve always dreamt about what it would be like to be desirable. No one ever showed interest until I lost the weight. This new found confidence didn‚Äôt last too long because I had already sunk down to a very deep place emotionally the previous year and I always dealing with a large number of insecurities. I eventually ended gaining the weight back and stopped putting effort into my appearance. None of it felt like it mattered because my self esteem had already been destroyed due to the bullying I received the previous year. It‚Äôs been eight years since I‚Äôve graduated from high school and I still haven‚Äôt recovered from the bullying I experienced. I still don‚Äôt have any love for myself and I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm more likely to come up with every possible reason why someone is being disingenuous with me when they‚Äôre giving me a compliment (not that I receive many anyways), than for me to actually believe them. I‚Äôve waited for most of my life for people to give me the OK for me to feel great about myself, and now I won‚Äôt believe anyone who tries to compliment me. I myself don‚Äôt even know what it‚Äôll take to build up my self esteem. Apparently I‚Äôm too averse against the concept of loving myself. ",0

"I used to be in a pretty bad place, in just about every regard, terrible job, bad money situation, could barely engage with my hobbies, no romantic attachment, and no path forward.

In the past year so many things have gotten better. I'm making a little more money, I have a job that isn't perfect, but one I don't hate, and that isn't really taxing physically or mentally. I have my own apartment and it's not evern an especially crappy one.

Even though so many things have gotten better, I'm still alone. I don't like my family, I have a few friends that I enjoy being around and that I hang out with, but there is a gaping hole that I can't fill because I've never had any real genuine love in my life. I think I'm a good person, that I'm smart and funny, but I just can't find my person. 

I thought that even though I can't find love, that improving everything else would make me feel better. I even started a new medication that has seemingly helped me, but there are still days where I just can't stop focusing on how no one in the world will want to be with me. I'm 25, and have never had any kind of relationship and the farther along I get the less likely it is that I'll ever find a single person that wants anything to do with me.

Currently, I‚Äôm dating a guy who, despite our cultural differences, is caring and patient. However, due to my anxiety and depression, I fear I‚Äôll lose him due to emotional exhaustion. He‚Äôs the second person I‚Äôve been with who has said that living with my emotional instability is challenging.

My job is very draining; I work with casinos and feel like a fraud. I‚Äôve been trying to change jobs, but it‚Äôs been difficult, even though many of my colleagues have managed to switch.

Right now, I‚Äôm in crisis. During my last one, I wished I wasn‚Äôt alive to avoid the pain and lack of energy.

With the lack of money, I‚Äôve been having fewer therapy and psychiatry sessions. But I‚Äôm trying to maintain some consistency.

The point is: Will I ever be able to wake up and feel happy? Will I be able to have an active routine with social groups and physical activities without succumbing to negative thoughts? Will I ever be able to achieve dreams that involve other people?

"Yeah, I should off myself out of dignity, to avoid any more humiliation. I am not someone who excels at anything, and in fact, I kind of suck at everything I do.

I am useless. So much so that I consider myself, and I can objectively vouch for such a point of view, a waste of resources. I lack the necessary skills in a vast repertoire of aspect to succeed in life and have a deserving life; social skills, practical skills, professional skills.

I suck at every game I've ever bought or pirated. It's not just the competitive shooters, but just about every game. I suck at every hobby I have. I want to be a writer and future author, but my writing skills are subpar to every and all published and unpublished author; I cannot read a fucking book even if my life depended on it. Why? Inattentiveness. ADHD-ridden brain. I cannot focus on any one thing at a time without feeling exhausted or bored.  
I suck at the classes I have in university. I am not the best student, or amongst the top. Fucking Christ, I am still studying in the same university for FOUR FUCKING YEARS and I just barely completed 25% of the program. KILL ME ALREADY. I suck at every single fucking social interaction I have. I'm friends with nobody, and when I'm partially allowed to exist within a friend circle, I'll be the wall nobody wants to speak to.

I suck at drawing, I suck a writing, I suck at gaming, I suck at socializing, I suck at learning, I suck at speaking, I suck at everything I do. I cannot even lose weight even if I wanted to. I decrease the food intake, increase water consumption, and yet I'm still as fat as I was years ago. Yeah, I'm not obese, but any kilogram above the ideal lean body is a death sentence if you want to have a partner.  
Oh, yeah, I also have no gf. Why would I? Other depressive people are depressed but HAVE WORTH. Other people may have ADHD, but they get super creative endeavours that make them desirable. What am I? A waste. Useless.

I guess when I was bullied and told I was mentally retarded, those bullies were right. I am mentally retarded.

I have not a single thing I'm good at. I don't mean ""the best amongst my peers"", but ""good enough that I'm happy with myself"". No.

Maybe, then, it is imperative to kill myself and avoid any further humiliation. When you're young, you're full of potential (or so people think of you); always at the brim to explode with a million creative ideas, and distil one or two into productive, long-life goals that will catapult you into a proper, deserving, well-lived life. But once you hit a certain age, around your early to mid 20s, people will wonder where is your potential.

Oh, you don't have potential. You're too broken to have potential. You are useless.

So I think to myself, this is enough. I want to die with dignity, both to myself and for others. I want to die early so I stop this ongoing humiliation of being utterly useless at everything I can or could do. I'll never be a good writer and author, I'll never be a good artist, I'll never finish my degree, I'll never be good at any game, I'll never have a girlfriend who loves me, I'll never be happy.

People, this is not a depression-rushed conclusion to my problems, but a natural outcome of a life full of failures. A man has only so much he can endure, and if I do not see any improvement whatsoever after being alive for 23 years, then I can safely and accurately conclude that this life is not worth continuing.

I will kill myself.",0

"Hello

Currently I'm considering psychopharmacology and wanted to ask you about your own experience with any libido changes on ssri. Was it really meaningful for you? Has it came back to natural level just after the end of therapy or did it need more time?

Thank you for all your answers ",0

"i met my now bsf about two months ago on the internet. he's a great friend &amp; has helped me in many ways. i genuinely enjoy talking to him. the thing is, he broke up with his ex about 6 months ago &amp; he's been crazy depressed &amp; suicidal since then. a little after we met, he started falling for me. so did i. he started showing signs of getting better. but it worsened when i told him i was atheist &amp; since he's a theist, there was no way we could ever end up together. then he was back to being depressed. 

everyday we talk about anything &amp; everything. all the time. from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed. some days he's really really depressed &amp; fsr i feel like i'm obliged to do anything &amp; everything in my power to make him happy. even if it doesn't work, i still do everything. i don't like leaving him to himself bc ik he'll start overthinking &amp; be sad again. 

he's my best friend &amp; it hurts so bad to see him this way. he doesn't deserve this &amp; i always feel like it's my responsibility to make sure he's not sad. he has an emo posting account on ig where he sometimes make posts saying he misses ""them"" &amp; it hurts so bad especially bc he's clearly in love with me. it makes me feel like he's using me to get over her. sometimes i wish for her to just come back to him, apologize &amp; take him back. i did kind of confront him about this but he assured me that he would never use me like that &amp; that he just misses being happy. but idk man. i try to ignore the posts on that account of his but they pop up on my feed &amp; with every post i feel a knife twist &amp; turn inside me. everytime i see that he's posted something sad on that account, i get so so anxious to check it out. sometimes i get close to tears seeing the shit he posts there. whenever he mentions his ex, i get so fucking anxious, i have to put my phone away for a while &amp; then come back.

i do everything i can to make him feel better but nothing works. he's so precious to me &amp; i just want him to be happy. i'm really boring &amp; unfunny but he still talks to me about anything.

he sometimes send me pictures of his online girl bsf whom he loves like a sister &amp; says stuff like ""she's so pretty i love her"" &amp; it's true. she really is pretty. she's gorgeous. everytime he sends me her picture, i can't help but zoom in &amp; admire her. she makes me feel so ugly &amp; insecure. everytime he sends me her picture i get so anxious bc ik he'll say something like he loves her or that she's so pretty &amp; idk why. sometimes i wonder if he does the same to my pictures with her but i doubt it. a few weeks ago i was crying bc i felt like i would never be pretty enough for him. i went to our chats &amp; pulled up pictures of her &amp; started crying even harder. i felt so insecure.

the thing is. i rarely ever cry. but these past two months i have cried about 3-4 times. i just got done crying for 40 minutes. i was even clean from self harm for almost two years &amp; i relapsed like last month. i've self harmed twice till then. i even had the urge to do it rn but i didn't. 

i just want him to be happy. even if it's without me. sometimes i feel like he doesn't love me &amp; it hurts. i'm very cautious while talking to him bc i don't want to say anything that'll remind him of his ex or make him sad. i don't tell him when i'm sad bc i don't want to add onto his depression. but he tells me everything. he shares a lot with me &amp; trusts me so much. we'll meet irl next year bc we'll go to the same university. who knows what'll happen till then. it's been like a week since our chats have been dry, bc he's sad &amp; i have no clue how to make him feel better. i have nothing to talk about. even if i do, his replies are short &amp; he seems uninterested. ik that's not the case &amp; he's just too sad to talk. &amp; that hurts. knowing i can do nothing to help. i've kind of accepted that i can't help him &amp; it hurts. i don't know what to do. i just want him happy. i feel so emotionally drained. he doesn't know any of this.

"I‚Äôm 16 and I feel like my life is meaningless.


I don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs actually wrong with me, no one likes me and I‚Äôm so alone not even my own parents. They scream and get physical with me whenever I do one thing wrong but my other siblings don‚Äôt get that.

Im the second youngest, I have 3 older brothers, 3 older sisters and one younger brother and I feel like my parents gave up on me but when my younger brother came along it‚Äôs like they had this re start and wanted to be parents again but only to him. My older siblings are all moved out and have families of their own and it‚Äôs only me and my brother at home. He‚Äôs only 4 years younger than me and my parents love him to bits. 

When they found out he was being bullied they went to the school and did all they could for him. They even got him a therapist. But when I was getting bullied they did nothing. When I said I wanted a therapist they laughed and told me I didn‚Äôt need one. When they found out about my sh they got mad and screamed at me and told my whole family even my younger brother who laughs at me and says ‚Äúshut up you lit cvt yourself‚Äù 

I hate it. I hate everything but I can‚Äôt bring myself to hate them.

Not even my own boyfriend likes me, he leaves for hours and hours and he fights with me everyday. He broke up with me on our 5 month anniversary and it broke me. He didn‚Äôt love me anymore but he came back a month later saying he missed me and when we got back together it was like he didn‚Äôt care. He doesn‚Äôt notice when I‚Äôm upset or when I‚Äôm annoyed, but I love him so much and I know he doesn‚Äôt love anymore

I get told by my parents and everyone in my family how weird and stupid I am. I have dyslexia and stuff but that doesn‚Äôt even matter to them. I hate seeing my friends parents do whatever they can for them while I‚Äôm stuck being lonely having no one to talk to. I know that no one can love me and I know how un loveable I really am. But I hope one day maybe someone will tell me how much they love me and how much I mean to them and maybe even might be scared of losing me. But even then I‚Äôm being stupid. 

I get told ‚Äúyou‚Äôre 16 obviously you will feel sad‚Äù but I can‚Äôt do this anymore. I know im ugly and everyone else thinks that. I just can‚Äôt do this anymore I can‚Äôt handle this i just want someone to tell me it‚Äôs gonna be okay and that they love me.",0

She's been with one of her colleagues a bartender.  I am the reason they met right now and a common friend of us said that the guy was trying to hit her since she started to work and she started to talk with him after a week later we broke up.

I don't know what to do or what to feel, there's just a empty hole in my chest now. I think she cheated on me but even though if i assume she didn't cheat she started seeing an other guy nearly after a week and we've been together for 2 years. That's still cheating for me.

"Just kind of feeling the need to vent here... I don't really feel any motivation anymore. I'm 31M. Have an okay job but am by no means wealthy. I have savings but can't afford a house and probably never will be able to. I've never been in a relationship and am starting to accept that I probably never will be in love. I don't really feel motivation towards anything in my life anymore. I go to work, am generally bored by my job and sit there for 8 hours waiting to go home most days.

I then get home, have no real motivation to do anything, and effectively sit there waiting to go back to work the following day.

I think that I've been depressed on some level for about 75% of my life, or at least since I was a teenager. Most of the time i've felt that some change in my life would make things better... ""When I get the new job I'll feel better."" or ""When I move I'll feel better."" or ""When I find a girlfriend I'll feel better.""

I'm starting to realize that none of those things ever really change anything. I recently got a new job, moved to a new city. I thought I would feel much better. I don't. There's almost always been some light at the tunnel that I convinced myself would make me feel better, but I've realized that my depression never goes away. I'm genuinely unsure if I'm capable of sustained happiness.

Even if I felt there was another light at the end of the tunnel/carrot on a stick to chase, I think its unlikely that my life will improve much from here. I don't think wealth or relationships are really in the cards for me. My life will likely continue to be a cycle of working a boring 9-5 and coming home to a boring/lonely apartment.

On top of those feelings, the world itself is so bleak to me. I feel that as a civilization and species, we're hopeless. I think we've reached a point where technological advances are actually a net negative for human happiness/fulfillment, but those advances are impossible to stop or reverse. Politically, I think the US is completely fucked. Both parties are corrupt and on some level or another just serving the interests of the ultra rich and elite at the expense of the 99%. I don't think that these problems are fixable either. The elites have managed to create alignment with the poor. Your 401ks are tied to the value of their companies. Your home valuation is skyrocketing because their corporations are buying up single-family homes across the country. If you want your bread crumb, you better hope they get their feast.

I just find life so depressing both on a personal level and when I look at society as a whole. I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately but I refuse to kill myself while my mom is alive because it would completely destroy her and thats about the only thing I care about anymore...

Again just felt the need to vent. I'll probably go see a therapist or psychiatrist soon and maybe that will be helpful.",0

"Last 10 years I felt like I'm skipping on everything in life. My young years is so... I don't know how to even say this... Painful.

I don't want to die. I want to live. From what I can see life can be beautiful... Just not mine. 

First I was incredibly shy. With time I managed to overcome it but then COVID hit. This will sound bad but I gotta be honest. 2020 was the best year for me in the last ten years. I found my first good job, got masters in physics, spend a bunch of time with my friends playing games. It was fun.

Then something majorly changed. Every new day I felt like death is coming and I couldn't understand what it is. I ignored it for about a year until it got so so bad. I couldn't sleep, not a one single good or positive though visited my brain. Level of tiredness was way to high to do basic tasks on the job. I decided to go to psychiatrist since I understood that something was very wrong.

Long story short I got diagnosed with GAD or generalized anxiety disorder. 2 years of treatment and it got a bit better to the point that doctors allowed to stop taking meds. I've felt fine for the first time in 3 years, but obviously those 3 years I was absent from normal life. At that moment I felt like I'm missing something. No relationship, no strength to pursue it, no desire to chase it.

Then happened something way worse than I could imagined. War in my country. It's not a political post so I won't talk it from the point of politics. My mental declined with massive speed, to the point that I've felt again that fear of death on a whole new scale. I knew that I could be drafted at any moment and with my health problems (stomach and spine problems) I knew I will not survive on the battlefield.

Now it's 3 years of war. This whole time I see funerals of young and old, men, women and most scary - children. I don't remember who said war is hell but that person was right. I never ever would wish something like this even to my worst enemy. Too bad my worst enemy happy that this is happening.

Now I'm looking at my life with understanding that even not on the battlefield I can die at any moment. And question myself ""what my life even was for?"". I have no family, kind, woman I love, solid salary, my own home or something to go towards. Some of my friends are dead or badly wounded. If I parishes right now, what did I even left? 

This post is not about asking for help, politics or something like that. This is just something I needed to get of my chest.

I don't know my future. I know my past. I know myself. And I don't like what I am. 

Maybe I will have a chance to send invites to my best friends for my wedding one day. Maybe I will see my kids being brought to life. Maybe I will be able just to enjoy life with someone I love.

Or maybe I will die soon and nobody will ever remember I existed.",0

But am I happy? Am I genuinely happy? Or is that just what I **NEED** to feel? 

I feel pathetic for every feeling that I have. Im stressed about exams? Why? I'm ""smart"" according to former colleagues and my partner... I dont deserve to feel stressed or anxious.

I have healthy coping mechanisms? But why need them? Other people might think they're weird. Other people have it worse. Others cope better.

Why do I still have the urge to selfharm or more?  
Why am I mentally exhausted every night? Why cant my damn mind stop running?

Helo, in short, i have tinnitus, OCD and OCD induced pretty bad anxiety which resulted in GERD - vomiting every morning.

I have taken one pill of 5 mg escitalopram, but that resulted in slight serotonine syndrome (psych. told me it could be it)- feeling hotness in my face (red face for two days), arms and legs, flu-like feeling, nausea, severe dry mouth, headache, sinutisis ect.

I also experienced pretty bad hyperacusis that lasted for a week whilst strongest for two days and then gradually dissapearing. Thank god it did not cause more tinnitus.

Do you think the serotinine syndrom could cause hyperacusis?

Now I am taking Lavender 80 mg for two weeks, but I am feeling that my previous symptoms are getting worse, but I have not vomited for two weeks.

I am currenty deciding between two possibilities: Mirtizapine or Vortioxetine (reccomended by psych.)

Do you think that Vortioxetine could result in simmilar experience as escitalopram did? It is pretty new and I did not read it can cause tinnitus (there are few cases)

Mirtizapine - I read some cases of tinnitus (not much), hearing loss (one case) and many cases of hard time with withdrawall.

My biggest concerns are my current tinnitus cannot be worsened or new one created and hyperacusis connot be created.",0

"I hate myself. Never gotten into cutting or other type of self-harm, but have my history with unhealthy eating behavior and sometimes use alcohol as a coping strategy as well. I am now looking for ""productive"" and seemingly healthy ways to prove my unworthiness to myself.

As a background: I have lost interest in almost everything in life years ago: sports, hobbies, people. Yes, I do enjoy occassional reading or company, but could live without those, too.
The only things I actually have to do and therefore get done are my job duties and taking care of my own basic needs. 
This has lead to me thinking I could as well try to reach some kind of toxic productivity-mode (partly because I need to get my shit together and partly to get an outlet for the self-loathing).

Over-exercising, a workaholic attitude towards my job and getting rid of some everyday comforts such as bed frame and also quitting warm showers are some examples on my mind.

"Sorry in advance, as I‚Äôm not sure exactly what my goal is with this post. Idk if I‚Äôm even posting in the right sub. I guess I just need to get this off my chest, so thank you in advance for reading and listening. 

Been taking Zops pretty consistently now at nighttime for the past few years. Sometimes I go a few nights without, but always end up falling back on it. Always take between 5mg-7.5mg- sometimes, very rarely, I‚Äôll take a 10mg. But never more than that per night. I buy it online with crypto, which I know is risky but at this point in my life, I just don‚Äôt care. 

I take Zop, not so much for the sleeping benefit (although that is admittedly a great feature of it) but because it sedates my mind, and my thoughts. It numbs my hurt. It just allows my brain to be quiet and slip into unconsciousness, quietly. All this, I yearn for on a daily basis. 

I acknowledge that gradually, I‚Äôm disintegrating. I wonder if it‚Äôs because of the Zopiclone‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôve felt so terrible for so long (far, far before I ever started taking it), that I have my doubts. I‚Äôve been sad for a long time. Maybe this is how I would be, Zopiclone or not. 

As it is, these days I feel like I am permanently encapsulated within a thick, dark fog. My mind is slow and languid. My speech is slow and slurred. I am tired; so, so agonisingly- yet blissfully- tired, every second of the day. My body feels like a lead weight. My limbs ache, despite doing nothing. 

Caffeine does not rouse me from this concious, coherent daily stupor. Nothing rouses me. I feel so numb. Food is an inconvenience that I can hardly ever be bothered with.

My mind and thoughts race throughout the day. And yet, I can‚Äôt make my body or brain actually do anything. The constant, dull ache behind my eyes is now almost a background sensation to me. 

Nothing seems or feels good to me anymore. Everything either feels like massive stress, or like nothing at all. Joy is a foreign concept that I have not experienced for a long, long time now.  I desperately look for anything and anyone else to blame for ‚Äúmaking me this way‚Äù, all the while I don‚Äôt even attempt to take the necessary steps to help myself. I just don‚Äôt have the energy, or the strength, or the intellect. I feel as though I possess a grand total of 3 whole brain cells.

Idk if this is because of the Zops, or just because of depression or something. But it feels like, at the end of each thick, fog-filled day, when I‚Äôm exhausted from the mental fight of it all, and ashamed of how inept I am at life, Zopiclone and the Zop-sleep is the only thing that temporarily relieves me from my flat, grey, overcast existence. 

I just want to add that I‚Äôm not suicidal or anything (tbh I‚Äôm far too lazy and tired to bother). Has anyone read ‚ÄúI Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream‚Äù by Harlan Ellinson? I just feel like the amorphous blob-guy at the end of the story; unable to live, and unable to die. Just‚Ä¶ there. Existing.

"I am currently on vacation out of school. This past month, I have been feeling suffocated with myself and my thoughts and don't know how to overcome it. I barely have any friends and we don't even talk that much, although I have someone whom I consider as a friend and we talk through the internet, I just still somehow feel so alone and just don't feel any warmth and love from anyone.

I feel so ridiculous and useless when it comes to household chores. The only long conversation that I had with my mom was her yelling at me because I just do no help in the house. My brother is more close with my mom and to honestly tell you, I sometimes hate how he makes me feel. He'd somewhat start ganging up on me with my mom, and although not with verbal words, I can feel it. (I don't know how to explain this further). I know that I may sound immature to some for feeling this way, as yes, I don't do much work i n the house but I am trying... I can not justify this matter, but yelling at me, not doing any intimate talk about how I am doing is just what makes me unmotivated and to grow more avoidant with them, especially my mom. 

Being consumed in the internet and having the internet to make intimate talks with me probably wasn't good for my mental health and my whole being. I feel so alone, and knowing that school was my only distraction makes it worse. Waking up everyday. No distractions. I have been living on a loop for years now. The internet is the only thing that keeps me entertained, I'm paranoid for the fact that I'm going to feel this way for the rest of my life. I'm still young, and is in my early teenage years so I will still hold on for that hope it will get better. 

I don't know why I'm having thoughts like this. How do I stop? Am I just being dramatic for thinking this way, or are my thoughts valid?

Please help me to stop feeling this way.

Not sure if it's that im just overly depressed or if humanity is becoming more and more  apathetic and cruel towards others.  I remember when people cared about feelings and wanting to help you.

I think of all those infant deaths. All of those shots at life that they missed. Maybe they would have made something great out of it.

Think of all young happy people who died of random terminal illness or freak accidents. Most of them wanted to live longer but the universe denied them that.

Then I think of myself. I don‚Äôt want this life. Ten attempts in as many years, all failed, it‚Äôs clear for some reason I can‚Äôt go through with this. But I hate this life. I‚Äôm garbage who doesn‚Äôt deserve to live, but doesn‚Äôt want it either.

"11 years ago I suffered a mild concussion from a skiing accident off a small jump at the age of 16. The accident itself wasn‚Äôt anything major, but I felt a sharp jolt to my head. Thinking it was just whiplash, I continued skiing well into the evening. The off feeling persisted, but didn‚Äôt think it could be a concussion since it was such a small fall. It also didn‚Äôt help my poles were stolen and thrown off the chairlift. The next day when I got into work I felt dizzy and even briefly forgot how to talk. I was diagnosed with a concussion on the spot and driven home.

For more context, I grew up with an extreme case of Dyslexia and mild ADHD in a household where there was a lot of arguing. I was no stranger to deep feelings of alienation and sadness. These feeling were never life threatening as I was always looking to the future. The months leading up to my concussion was a real sea change in my life, I developed a strong friend group, got my best report cards ever, made honor roll, became a accomplished student athlete breaking a school record and was league MVP. My parents weren‚Äôt arguing as much and they were expressing how proud of me they were. For the first time since I was a child I truly felt happy and optimistic. To top it off I met and began talking to the girl who would become my first real girlfriend and now my fianc√©. I remember simple things like riding the subway or walking home from school and amazed at how great and full of color life was feeling. I felt truly comfortable in my skin.

Then I got concussed. Luckily enough it was at the start of February break so it was easier to lie in bed and relax. I missed the next week of school and when I stepped back into the world, everything felt different. The feeling of life being full of color was gone. It was like a reverse Wizard of Oz going from color to black and white. Truthfully things started to feel gray and I no longer felt comfortable in my skin.

Then my friend group was falling apart and constantly poking fun at me. My Dad‚Äôs company was in dire straits, my Mom had some of her own health problems which resulted in her violently lashing out. It also didn‚Äôt help this was the latter half of Jr Year when SATs and the start of college applications. 

A couple times I remember feeling so overwhelmed that I collapsed on the floor. For the first time, I felt truly depressed and didn‚Äôt know how to communicate how was truly feeling. When I tried to explain to my parents or friends how my brain was feeling and I was experiencing persistent headaches, they downplayed it saying I ‚Äòget over it‚Äô and that I only had a mild concussion. Even the doctors said I was fine, but I was too afraid to tell anyone just how badly I was struggling and the dark places my brain was going. 

It felt as if all hope had been sucked out of me. I used to wake up and excited to take on the day, now I was waking up and dreading the day ahead. I began having a more difficult time focusing on schoolwork and I totally bombed the SATs. The one saving grace was I was now in a very committed and loving relationship.

When I think back to my senior year of high school, all I am reminded of is feeling deeply depressed and always trying to hide it. All throughout college I was depressed, battled suicidal ideation and even took a semester off because I had a depressive episode. My senior year, my parents warmed up to my depression, it was easier to talk about and they were more supportive. My depression was at its worst the summer after my college graduation. Since college, each year has gotten progressively better and better. I went back into therapy and two years ago began taking antidepressants. Now I almost feel I have crawled out of a a depressive hole and gained my optimism back. 

Still I can‚Äôt help but notice the fact that it was that‚Äôs concussion 11 years ago when I truly started feeling depressed. I always blamed my depression on what was going on around me and the fact it runs in my family, but it was that concussion when I first felt my brain change and depression sink in. It‚Äôs almost as if I‚Äôm finally feeling I‚Äôve recorded from the concussion. Would life have gotten harder due to the events that happened to those around me, yes but I feel my concussion made it worse. For the first time since I was 16, I‚Äôve gone months without thoughts of suicide and is the least depressed I‚Äôve felt since before the concussion. Still I can‚Äôt help but feel an aching sadness that maybe I wouldn‚Äôt have experienced this over decade long depression if I decided not to hit that small jump.

"I‚Äôm on month 3(?) w/o my meds after finally finding a small cocktail that works and I feel like I‚Äôm losing grip of my mental. I‚Äôm figuring out how to get a refill on my prescription after breaking up w my therapist but I‚Äôm struggling in the meantime.

"It all started when the love of my life 'S' broke up with me. I couldn't handle it. I would lock myself in my room, rarely stepping out or talking to anyone. My father took me to a psychiatrist, and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and panic disorder. Since 2014, I‚Äôve been on meds. The doctor tried to take me off them many times, but I just couldn't handle it and had to go back for consultations.

This January, the doctor finally took me off the meds. I was happy, thinking I had defeated depression and moved on from her. Since then, I haven't been on any medication.
Fast forward to last week. One of my close friends 'A' is getting married, and we were talking about how everyone is either married or getting married. Then he drops the bombshell: 'S' got married last month ('A' is good friends with S). This news shouldn‚Äôt have affected me, I hadn‚Äôt thought about her in years. But as soon as I heard it, my world turned upside down. My hands and legs started shaking, my heart pounding heavily, and all the memories came rushing back. I couldn‚Äôt stand or comprehend what A was saying. After all these years, it shouldn‚Äôt have hurt, but it broke me. It felt like someone stabbing me in the heart.

Since that day, I‚Äôve been having daily panic attacks. I‚Äôm not able to work in the office. Im just there, keeping my head down on the desk most of the time and in the restroom.

"I was diagnosed by my therapist and psychiatrist with depression and was prescribed Wellbutrin. A lot of my symptoms involve lack of motivation, overwhelming feelings of being uninspired, having a fatalistic attitude towards my day (like no matter what I do, I'm convinced of a negative outcome for a lot of things,) sometimes having random spells of being emotional, and feeling too overwhelmed to engage in my tasks for the day so much that I just end up sleeping a lot. When I do push/fight through to get something done, it feels very exhausting and often don't feel accomplished even if the outcome was great on paper.

My psychiatrist mentioned that this is not a stimulant, which I am trying to avoid, but that this would help with those symptoms, especially with getting my motivation regulated. 

Id like to ask if anyone in this sub has had any success or failures with this medication. How has your experience been? Did you have similar symptoms that improved after taking this medication?

"Throwaway but I'm hitting 30(M) in a bit and I legitimately feel like I've hit a complete dead end in my life.

Lost my job two years back and been living off savings since - I had a pretty senior gig and I was essentially at the top of my peers but after losing it, it's hard to climb back to anywhere decent. But that's just the normie stuff, let's deep dive into the misery well for a bit while I allow myself some self-pity.

Since my teens, I've been suffering from unending headaches/migraines. Untreatable, and non-diagnosable. I wake up to pain, and I fall asleep to pain - my sleep is never rested because of this, and I've come to realise that I genuinely don't know what a good sleep actually is, after over a decade of this. I simply sleep for the physical benefits, but my mental has never benefitted from the process. The worst bit about the headaches, is that it chronically cripples me - it's hard to work out without it coming back to bite me and leave me unable to operate.

I moved back in during the pandemic, only to find that my dad has become a shell of himself due to a mix of dementia and Parkinson's - so it feels like part of my life has been lost due to a feeling of my mum needing me to be around to help out. I personally think the burnout from the sudden need to be a caregiver and juggling my job led to losing my gig, but it's whatever.

I can't find the motivation to do anything anymore. The fatigue, the headaches, the idea that I've become hopeless - it's all coalescing and I guess I needed to just write this all out and send it to the universe, even if it amounts to nothing.

At this point, I legitimately think I've given up. I exist to serve others, even the idea of offing myself is trapped by the idea that everyone would be burdened by it. I have friends, sure, but who would want to listen to all this. They know bits and pieces but I generally am rather high-functioning so it's under covers for most of my life. Quite sure a lot of people would be freaked if they saw the true depths of my despair.

Sorry for the wall of text, I think I just needed to vent.",0
"I feel like I lost myself. I was in relationship (the one that I always dreamed about) everything was like I wanted. 
I felt accepted by my ex, I felt comfortable around his family. I fell in love with him when I saw him being engaged in what he loves, when I saw how he treats his family and when he took care of me when I felt tired. 
When I imagined what we could have (that time) it was like from fairytale.
He talked about how special I am for him, that he never brings anyone that close. And also his sister told me same.
After I started to feel like I‚Äôm not the only one, I felt like I am the problem, like I‚Äôm not good enough.
Found out that he cheated on me with a Thai girl.
Now, I feel like I don‚Äôt have anything. Like I don‚Äôt deserve to be happy. I moved to city just because of him, I have no job, no friends.
Every day is hard and I am so tired of all emotions. I wish I could look in his eyes and tell him ‚ÄúI am not the fault that you cheated on me‚Äù

"
25F, struggling with depression and c-ptsd since the age of 16, as well as with newer additional trauma from last year. My mind has become increasingly foggy and empty to the point where I find it difficult to think and articulate. I excelled in HS, got through a five-year/integrated masters in applied mathematics with decent grades (although with so severe cognitive, sleep and emotional issues that I had to postpone several exams and used an extra term to finish my masters), and lately it has gotten so bad that I‚Äôm embarrassed to be around people and struggle to trust myself with anything that requires attention to detail. I‚Äôve mostly lost my thought processes, and am terrified that I will never feel like a thinking human being again or be able to function on a normal level. Mathematics used to bring me a lot of joy, but less than two years after writing my thesis I can no longer do it at all.

Has anyone experienced cognitive decline with similar progression? And did it ever get better? ",0

"This is it. I won't be a coward again. I've been fighting for 15 years and nothing ever changed. Every single fucking day is worse than the last.    
     
I've been diagnosed with severe depression, ADHD and Asperger's for 3 years now. I grew up in a torn and abusive household and was bullied ever since kindergarten.      
      
I've tried so damn hard for so damn long and just get beat up for it. I really just wanted to be loved. But live wouldn't even give me that. I'm so sick of this bullshit. I'm not even close to being an adult and the only fucking thing I know is pain.    
   

I wanted to die since I was a child. Honestly, I never understood why I should all of this work and effort into something I never even asked for. Just waking up every morning and coming to terms with the fact that I am actually alive, conscious and present in this world is painful on a level I can't express.   
    
I don't want this, and I never did. Life's always been nothing but a slow, boring and painful process that ultimately leads to nothing in my eyes. Every day is just a copy of the last.
     
There are no words that could convey the hatred I have for this place, for myself and everything around me. Simply being alive makes me so fucking angry. I've always wanted to die the most brutal and agonizing death I can, just to know what real pain feels like.       
        
I've never done anything for a reason. I made every choice in my life on a whim, just because I felt like it. I've done the most depraved things to myself, just for the sake of doing ANYTHING.      
         
All my therapists already gave up on me. I'm only 15 and already have been told multiple times what a hopeless case I am. I made others spiral into depression, just by talking about how I view life. I genuinely believe that I'd do the world a favor by dying.    
    
I don't deserve to be loved. I'm a thief, a liar and an addict. It's fucking pathetic. Just looking in the mirror makes me want to die.     
      
It doesn't fucking matter what I do, I always end up here, crying on the shoulders of strangers and begging for help and attention even though I don't even know what's wrong with me.    
    
      
I'm completely numb by now. Everything stopped helping. Not even drugs can still make me feel good.

"I'm not entirely sure if questions are allowed on this sub but I'm still going to try to ask.

I know there's things like seasonal depression and stuff but I'm talking about like I might feel fine when talking with friends or when I'm ""distracted"" but then I might have a small trigger that just breaks the distraction (like accidentally being ignored or interupted or even just a small thought) and then everything just feels so depressing and sad. And I'm not saying I only feel ""happy"" when ""distracted"", I feel happy a lot but also I have suicidal idealiation and stuff and it sucks.

An example of the ""sudden depression"" thing is like, I was sitting in drama class (I'm a minor so I go to school and have drama as a subject) and in drama we sit on the floor in a circle and read our script in turns. I went to sit next to my friend and it happened to be near a girl who i guess doesn't really like me (I'm not very popular, I don't know why, I didn't do anything wrong just people don't really like me (I think people were talking about me in the class GC (which i wasnt invited to) last year because i saw my name in there a couple times) and I noticed she shuffled away a bit so she wasnt near me and I was having a great time before that but when I noticed that I kind of just went into a kind of spiral where I started to think everyone hates me (even my friends) and just had all the suicidal and SH thoughts there and everything and I just felt like shit.

I don't know if that and stuff like that actually counts as depression but i just want to know if it could be?",0
"I'm 22 ftm, and i have BPD, ADHD, depression, and severe anxiety (including social anxiety). 
There's times that i want to do something, i'm determined to really, but the depression makes it impossible to, and i get even more depressed about the fact that i can't get myself to do it. 
For example, my biggest issue right now is that i've been trying to lose weight. I'm 92kgs, and it's been heavily affecting my self esteem, especially because i'm a short person too, i'm 158cm, and the weight really shows. Every time i look at myself in the mirror, i feel so many horrible things, from disgusting, to disappointment, to sadness. And it's even harder for me because i have a beautiful face, as everybody around me says. And i get all sorts of comments on my body, people will tell me ""you are gorgeous if it wasn't for your body"", even my mom says stuff like that, i've heard comments from her that broke my heart on many different occasions. I've never really bothered to change anything about my body for a long time, until a couple of months ago, it just all came to me like a hurricane. And i felt like i wasn't comfortable with my body anymore. So i've been wanting to do something about it, i've even created a whole plan, to sign up at a gym and and start working out, take walks and exercise everyday, start jumping ropes at home, eating healthier, no more junk food and unhealthy beverages. But i've been too depressed to even start doing anything. And because i'm not doing anything, it's making me even more depressed, and i've been just stuck in this cycle for the past month. And i have no idea how to get out of it. I can't being myself to even get out of the house, i'm staying up until 6:00 AM, and sleeping until 2:00pm if not more sometimes, i've been skipping my meds, and i've been really irritable and angry. I'm unemployed at the moment because i'm too focused on my studies, i have one year left to get my masters degree, and i'm always so stressed during the semester, so i wouldn't be able to pull of working and studying at the same time, especially with my BPD and my unpredictable mood swings. And every day, my parents give me shit about doing nothing with my life and just sitting at home all day during the summer, and part of that feels true, but i'm an illustrator for a reason; i'm a major introvert and i'm socially anxious as mentioned before, so being an illustrator is my dream job, i could do stuff from home instead of being an employee and sticking to a schedule. I want to maybe be a youtuber, create art content, or maybe writing and illustrating my own comic book, or anything that allows me make a living in a way that's comfortable for me. So there's that, i guess what i've been trying to say is, that i want to change the course of my life, but i'm too emotionally drained, and i'm in need of some advice.

"I‚Äôm not a troll this is genuinely what I‚Äôve been going through the past 2 years.

I‚Äôm nearly 18 and 2 years ago when I was 16 I was in a really bad place. I was depressed and isolated myself in my room every single day for nearly the whole year. I was dealing with other issues at the time which led to this. I had been watching porn 1-2 times a day since I was 10  but when I isolated myself it went up to 2-3 times a day. I always knew I was straight and never thought differently. I have seen gay porn and trans porn before and it doesn‚Äôt turn me on at all as I don‚Äôt like it.

When I was depressed and watched a lot of porn, I ended up looking at pictures of a feminine looking man that was in a bikini and had surgery to look like a woman. There was no nudity involved and I was only focusing on the butt nothing else. I did this a few more times over the next few months (probably only another 5 times within 3-4 months). 

After the last time, the regret suddenly sunk in and since then I‚Äôve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and honestly I hate myself for doing this stuff.

I‚Äôm not trying to be homophobic. I just always knew I was straight. Since I realised my actions, I look at the pictures to see if I‚Äôm still aroused by them, but each time I am disgusted by them.

I feel straight again and I honestly do not ever desire to look at those pictures ever again, but I also feel like I am unable to be straight again after the actions I had done in the past.

Is it possible for me to be straight like I was before? I genuinely do not have any desire to do it again and I regret it so much. I‚Äôve been suicidal for nearly two years I just can‚Äôt cope with what I had done.

"Some facts about me:

\* I'm 25, soon to be 26 and I stayed inside my house for almost a decade (From 2014 to 2024.) Dealing with depression/anxiety.

\* Never had a job.

\* Don't have any friends. 

\* Came from an incestuous family.

\* I live in a shitty little town ‚Äîroughly 6 thousand people‚Äî with no opportunities.

\* Never had a partner. 

\* still a virgin, never kissed anyone, never gone out on dates etc..

\* I'm black and a homosexual ‚Äî gosh!!! Could it get any worse??? Absolutely!!!!‚Äî overweight and unattractive. 

\* I have no one to support me financially.

\* I have nothing.

I wish I were in a better place today, I wish I had a better family, a normal family, I wish I had someone to support me emotionally...¬† It hurts seeing people succeed in life while I'm here, stuck at home, I feel like I was left behind.. I have so many situations in my life that I never had the chance to experience, and it's not that the opportunities presented itself to me and I turned my back on them, certain opportunities were never offered me in the first place, It has been incredibly difficult, I wasted so many years of my life, my youth is gone now. I'm feeling lost, I don't know what to do honestly, I have gone out trying to find a job, but for whatever reason no one will hire me, not even the local grocery stores. 

What am I supposed to do? I'm scared. Truthfully, I do not want to kill myself, I want to live!!! I just wish life weren't this difficult. I'm not asking for anything glamorous, I just want to live a calm, simple, life... A¬† stable job, have friends, a partner, have a dog or two, start a family, live as comfortably/peacefully/peaceably as I fucking possibly can. That's it! I'm not asking for much!!! 

I just want someone to talk to in REAL LIFE, All I want right now is affection ‚Äî in a non sexual way‚Äî I haven't hugged anyone in years. Can you imagine that?? I'm not even exaggerating, I have literally no one to talk to besides myself and the walls..¬† I'm the unluckiest guy on earth!!! Damn!! For so many years I had these fantasies about someone knocking on my door, looking¬† for me, coming to my rescue, but that never happened, and it never will. 

As I have mentioned, my family was incestuous, so we do have lots of issues. We barely talk to each other, we go weeks and months without exchanging a word.. My mom's new boyfriend is a morbidly obese alcoholic, my older sister found herself a husband and she moved away and never talked to us again. 

Recently my mother had both of her legs amputated ‚Äîdue to diabetes mellitus‚Äî and I am her caregiver, and I will probably be her caregiver for the rest of her life. Problem is: If I do killl myself I will be killing my mother ‚Äîindirectly‚Äî as well. Because who's going to take care of her? Her boyfriend spends 99% of his time drinking, or high on drugs, or stuffing his face with food!!! 

The question is: Is there any way that I can improve my life or is it over for me??? Can someone please give me an honest answer? Do I still have time to live a normal and happy life?? Keep in mind that I am approaching my thirties... 

By the way, sorry if my post doesn't make any sense/ is unclear. I was homeschooled so I do not have a lot of knowledge.

"Just believe me, your brain is not you. You don't have to understand it, just believe me. It's your machine. Next time when you're lazy to do something, tell yourself: it's your imagination. Brain, you're wrong. You only think, that you're lazy. You're actually not. Just get up and do it, you'll be fine. Still lazy? Omg, brain, stop bullshiting me. I'm not gonna let you trick me. I control you, you don't control me. I want to get things done and you're not gonna convince me that I'm lazy. I'm smarter than you. 

Treat your brain like a machine that is separate from you. Use it to your best advantage. If it does something you don't like, scold it. Talk to it. Everything you feel is an imagination of your brain. When you're happy it's just your brain's fantasy. It's actually not true. But let it be, because it's great to be happy! But when you're sad, just remember that it's an imagination. Command your brain to imagine different things.

"I know this might be a symptom of depression and I know I can't possibly do everything. I also know that some of these things I should do, but life for me is a constant stream of things I don't want to do. Having to do them anyway. Getting exhausted and then neglecting things I should do. I'm a single man 32, I work full time in tech support. I have family and friends that want to see me, but I don't really want to see them. When I am with other people I experience a constant pain that I can't describe. Maybe this is what people call anxiety? I feel pain when people talk to me. I feel constant guilt over saying the wrong things or being awkward. It's like they don't give me the feedback I need to feel at ease. There's a constant needling and sarcasm, and I just don't feel rapport with anyone. It's like I'm not on anybody else's wavelength. I used to feel connected to people, but not anymore. I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I've tried so hard putting myself out there, but all it leads to is more things I don't want to do and environments I don't want to be in. I quit teaching because of it. Before that I quit university. I quit sports. I quit hobbies. I quit clubs. I've quit friendships. I've quit everything and just decided that getting my work life to function is my top priority. But I feel constant guilt that I'm not playing sports, not dating, not decorating my apartment, not practicing guitar or chess, not eating healthy, not cooking enough for myself. Some people make me feel guilty. My father points out the things I don't do when he's over. And he's right, it's not normal, but I don't know how to get there. My brother critizices everyone for everything, but he still hurts me when he points out what I don't do.

Of course I concider suicide, but it's obviously not what I want. It comes from not living up to what I think society wants from me. Don't spam me with the suicide hotline stuff. I don't live in the US.

I've tried therapy, but I can't navigate that system. I can't afford private help and I don't know how to fit it into a schedule. Nobody else at my work takes time off for frequent appointments. When I've gotten ""help"" it's mostly been a shitshow of wrong diagnoses, being tossed around the system, talking to people with no empathy or sympathy for my situation, being coerced into taking antipsychotics, only for the professionals to change their minds about what is actually wrong. At this point I have a diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder with schizoid tendencies, which might be correct.

Right now I have 3 weeks off work. Just sitting in my apartment feeling guilty about not doing anything. People think it's weird I don't have plans and is not going traveling. It's my birthday in a week and I have nothing planned. I never have had plans for my birthday since I was a child. I don't actually have any friends where I live.

How do I get on track to be better? Or should I just work on not being hard on myself?",0
"
I (22M) have been dating this wonderful girl (23F) for 8 months now. I love her very much, she has everything I could ask for in a girlfriend. However, our relationship hasn't been easy as we both suffer from poor mental health. She has officially diagnosed depression which makes her operate on low energy and often delve into anxious thoughts. She's also a college student, so even though she receives treatment, her health has really nosedived this semester.

Throughout our relationship, she would frequently comment on her feeling inadequate. Phrases like 'I'm fat', or 'I'm stupid', or 'I'm lazy', or 'I don't do well at school'. Every time I would either comfort her and say she's perfect the way she is or try and encourage her to see the situation from a different perspective. For example, I would say, 'Look at what you have achieved on medication and low energy! You have a  severe mental condition, and yet other people perceive you as a sort of a genius. That's something to be EXTREMELY proud of!'

However, I have my own issues. For the past 8 months (what a coincidence) I've been helping my family take care of my nana who suffers from dementia. We're too poor to afford a nursing home and mother and father are severely unprepared to care for a terminally ill person. We have bickered, argued, our family has basically fallen apart. This has taken a toll on my mental health.

My gf's state has also got worse. She began crying and feeling inadequate more frequently. She would tell me how she wasn't proud of herself and how she wished she died. And in my poor mental state, instead of encouraging her, I became harsh and abrasive. We bickered about small things and would often have difficult conversations about the relationship and our issues. I would get extremely arrogant and all but outright state how much I had helped her when she needed help. She would also get anxious thoughts and doubts about both our relationship and my intentions with her.

She went on a family vacation in early July. We had several more difficult convos, and then she decided to reduce contact with me. She said it wasn't a break and that she still wanted a relationship, it's just that she needed to recharge and recuperate. We've only been briefly updating each other on how our day went since. She will come back on July 27 and then we'll get to talk about everything. 

Had I had better control over my state, I would've handled hers. And now, I fear, I might have damaged the relationship irreversibly. 

TL;DR: 
Have a wonderful relationship with a great girl. She suffers from depression. I used to be able to calm her anxious thoughts down, but as my mental health deteriorated, I became more irritable and arrogant. I'm afraid by this I've done irreversible damage to the relationship.",0
"I reached out to cousin again for help and he berate me. And they say why we don't speak up. Shit
This ain't the first time. When I don't open up they say don't be a hero. When I open up they're gonna talk down to me. 
I was slowly improving, baby steps. Now I don't feel hopeful anymore. This is the reason why people don't reach out. 
My family alienate me too. I was just trying to communicate about business (not feelings). And my mom just tell me to go to a mental hospital. The non stop demonizing without any reason.
People just stopped seeing you as a fellow human being 
I could use some hospitalizations now anyway. Fine. 

I said maybe we could play table tennis together which he said okay. Then he started berated me when I say need Non-judgmental support. You aren't allowed to ask for help nor are you allowed to act as if everything is okay. I think it's an ego thing. 

The last time I got berated was when I have scabies. 2 years ago. I had it for a year before I manage to keep it in control. Even my mother scolded me when I ask for help. I couldn't sleep. I get itchy when it's warm. My mom to this day don't believe I have scabies even after I confirmed my diagnosis with a dermatologist. She cursed me. Sigh 

It's been a year since I recovered. Why everyone thinks they are allowed to bully me. I'm tired 
People stopped treating you as a fellow human being when they don't see you as an equal. 

I just wanna have some warmth in life. I wanna play video games with my bro. ",0

"I (M33) been feeling really down for the last couple of years, and, as a stress eater, I gained about 15 kgs since the pandemic/parenthood. As I wanted to tackle the root problem, i.e. my depression, I consulted with my GP, and she prescribed Lexapro, which I took for about 1.5 years. Unfortunately, this made me gain another 15 kgs. (I'm 180cm and went from weighing 80kg to a massive 110kg) Mentally, I didn't feel that depressed anymore though, apart from the fact that the added weight took a massive toll on my self conscience. So a couple months back I decided to quit Lexapro, did so successfully and started taking care of my body some more: I started eating healthy (keto) and about 10 days ago I bought a fitbit and started doing 10k steps per day... I felt so good as I finally started to really shed some weight (the keto helped, but combined with the walking, it went way faster)... However, since a few days my lower legs started hurting every time I'd go for a walk, and today it was so bad I had to return home after about 10 minutes. I feel so bummed out and haven't felt this bad / sad / depressed in a long long time, years actually. I feel so hopeless... I deliberately chose a form of exercise that wouldn't be too hard on my joints and then this... I just can't anymore.",0
so my boyfriend calls me up and doesn't say anything and I start asking things here and there like how his day was how was the gym how's that new course that he's learning going on and he keeps answering with just yes it's okay and things like that I asked him if he was upset he says he's not it gets a bit awkward but then again I am trying to be cheerful and just asked him if he wants to watch something instead of talking on the phone he denies then goes silent again at this point idk what to talk about then he tells me that I have nothing to say and that I just keep talking about random topics I go silent at that point for about two minutes and literally I get a breakdown but trying to keep calm I just say that neither do you so why are you pointing me out he says because he hates me then i tell him that if that's the case he shouldn't be talking with me then he says that he has to use the toilet and I hang up I cried for like 5 minutes after that idk how to keep up with this relationship I am trying my best but it times like this I am not even sure what is happening ,0

"I (15M) just need to vent I'm sorry for wasting your time.

  
I can barely get in the courage to text my friends I ghost them because I feel like they don't care and I know I'm a bad friend for doing this I try not to but my anxiety is too much. I've done so many bad things to my body and my self worth is just so shattered. Last year in September I told my parents I am aromantic (one who does not experience romantic attraction) and they kinda brushed it off. I set a note on their nightstand loosely explaining stuff. The next day, my mom just told me ""that's a cool thing to learn about yourself"" and my dad asked if I wanted to tell anyone and that ""you may not want a romantic relationship, but later in life you'll desire companionship"". They never asked any more questions. It has been 10 stupid fucking months. I don't have the strength to tell them I'm asexual, bi, and want to identify as gender neutral. They brushed it off and I fucking hate it. My dad also thought it was funny one time to call trans people ""transformers"" when talking about a law our state passed. In front of my grandparents. I don't even care anymore about wanting to identify as gender neutral I'll just suppress it for a while

They also brushed off my voice, which for almost 2 years has been pitched around an E#4-C5 (it changes based on my mood/volume I'm trying to reach) and I can't raise my voice's volume or deepen my pitch (though I can hit some sick notes like the highest note of Cemetery Gates by Pantera, which is an A5). At all. I think I have a thing called puberphonia (look it up) and I can't even really talk if there are more than 5 people talking in a classroom. I asked them if I could go to a doctor and my mom got angry and told me ""do you want me to take you to a speech therapist""? No, not anymore, because you are fucking angry and you truly don't care. That was last December. They are going to talk to my doctor about it at my next checkup, they said. They said that a month ago. My next checkup is in like 2 weeks. They don't even care enough to get me help, they just wait it out. They don't know what it's like to learn sign language and before bed wish your voice just stops when you wake up. Fucking dumbasses.

I got h.arassed for over 20 minutes in front of my 8th period class in May by multiple people and they made fun of my identity and my voice and I felt really shitty I did some bad things that night. Nobody helped me. I didn't break down there at least. At night I broke down bad and did some bad things to my body.

  
I just needed to vent about this. I vented about something else earlier but I just need to get it out.

  
(Also, I'm not suicidal and my parents are actually good people, they genuinely love me and care for me, they do not abuse me in any way. They just made bad decisions)",0
"ok so, for a little backstory i (17M) have mild autism, and me and my ex (17F) were dating for about 4 months but they were the best 4 months of my life, i had known her for about 5 years through secondary, and had a crush on her for 3-4 years while she was in another relationship and apparently she liked me back, i had written songs about her and had a special song which reminded me of her (looking out for you - joy again). simply put, we had a lot of history. in our relationship, she made me feel happiness like ive never felt before but she broke up with me just over a week ago and we talked for the following few days then went no contact, leaving on good terms. today i reached out to her just to acknowledge the breakup, not to beg or anything like that i simply just wanted to talk to her as friends.


we got onto the topic of the breakup and she seemed reluctant to talk about it which i kinda get and she even said ""You can text me about anything that you want to just not the break up"". this is roughly how the convo went:

me: ""hi""

her: ""hi?""

i asked her how shes been and then i said:

me: ""i just wanted to say i want you to be happy thats all i want, i just honestly wish i did better as a boyfriend for you because you deserve it""

her: ""You‚Äôve said before [...] You don‚Äôt seem ok""

me: ""i know but its natural [...] its just ive been thinking a lot about our relationship and issues that could be solved but i understand we need space and i dont want to push anything onto you i just wanted to be completely transparent with you that i still love you and i still care""

her: ""Thank you""

and i asked a question i probably shouldnt have. i asked:

""do you still have feelings for me"" 

and i got:

""Stop trying to hurt yourself""

but i pushed and told her itd help me move on, and she said:

""No I don‚Äôt [...] If I still had feelings for you I would still be with you""

that shot a cold sharp pain through my heart but now i guess i just feel numb. i know i messed up and did stuff wrong i understand that now but its too late to change it, i just want her back. i felt like me and her had something really special. and i dont know how long ill be lonely again for and im afraid of never feeling love like it again, but my friend stated maybe i feel like this because she gave me my first taster of what a good relationship is like, and i seek validation and happiness from her because of this as well as me liking her for so long and she liked me back, and our history and how special the relationship felt. which is maybe why i dont want it to go away.

anyways, when i told her she made me really happy in the relationship she replied with:

"" It never felt like I made you happy ever [...] How did you think that made me feel""

i feel like i expressed my happiness all the time around but i guess she didnt feel the same. i replied with:

""awful, and for that im truly sorry""

everything just sucks, i wish i had appreciated her more and been more grateful for her company because now shes gone shes all i want. i know i screwed up but my friends seem to think im putting too much of the blame on myself.


another thing that has given me mixed signals is that she is really open and happy to talk about anything other than the breakup, like she will carry convos and stuff if it isnt about us separating but is extremely dry if anything about our breakup is mentioned. also, the day we broke up which was a thursday, (tmi) she was sending me sexual messages and i was reciprocating, but then she went and met her friend and about an hour later i received a breakup message. for the last day or so before this we didnt message much but i thought that was because we had just spent 3 days straight together catsitting, and we probably needed some time away from each other im not sure. anyways, the sexual messages to a breakup text seemed to me like a drastic change and when i asked how long she'd been feeling like this she said:

""since monday"" (when we started catsitting, which to me doesnt seem like a lot of time to rethink an entire relationship but i will respect her ultimate decision)

and when i asked for some reasons because there wasnt really any in the breakup text i got (and im paraphrasing):

she needed to focus on herself
she felt like she didnt see me as much as she wanted to (im in college to do a-levels, go to the gym and work but i saw her as often as i could)
she needed to focus on her mental health
she felt we werent on the same page anymore and to be fair we didnt have many mutual interests but that didnt bother me
she thought it was for the best


i picked up my stuff the next day, friday, and we talked for about an hour in my car, i promised myself i wouldnt cry or anything but i couldnt stop myself. she comforted me which was nice and like i said we went to sit in my car to talk stuff out. we talked like we were still in a relationship, she even called me ""babe"" twice on accident. she sorta gave me hope by saying she might regret it and sorta hinted at the possibility of getting back together once she worked on herself but told me not to wait for her. however, her friend (the one she was with when she sent the breakup text) had also recently broken up with her boyfriend (coincidentally one of my friends) and she sorta gave him hope and the half-promise of getting back together, yet is now going on a date with another guy currently and its broke my friends heart. anyways, and before she left my car after we talked for that hour she sorta lingered for a bit, like she wanted to say something or she wanted me to say something, so i just asked her if she wanted one final kiss and she agreed and we kissed and said ""i love you"" one final time and we agreed we'd miss each other.

i forgot about some photos of me and her i had ordered and they arrived on monday, i asked her if she wanted them back and she said:

""oh shit i forgot about those. no i dont want them""

another thing is that i work with her mother and her auntie, and her mother is absolutely lovely she gave me a hug and asked how i was doing because we both really liked each other. we just chatted for a bit and i guess agreed it wasnt meant to be, and i thanked her for always making me feel welcome in her home and in her family. she said im welcome anytime and that my ex still cares about me just i guess we werent meant to be. her mother told me that im a lovely boy and she joked that she wished i had a good influence on my ex, and i joked back saying i tried.

also, one last thing i promise, she and her ex went together for 3 years, and broke up and got back together multiple times and he was honestly an awful human being. so why does she hate the chance of a retry with me when (not trying to sound narcissistic or anything) i was so much better to her than he was.


anyways, enough ranting. i feel numb currently but i know its going to hit me like a truck later and ill be miserable. i was thinking maybe i could call her and ask if she wants to go on a walk sometime as friends and maybe we could rekindle something then as i truly believe if she just gives me a second chance we can truly change things and i can be the best boyfriend to her.

i dont know though, i want to respect her decisions and if thats without me i guess i must accept it and try my hardest to move on. but i feel awful. the thought of her with another man hurts me so much, i just want to show her i can be a better person.

any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you very much for your time.",0

I don't have any achievements just got 1 gold medal and one silver in taekwondo and a trophy from school. But i know these things are just waste and not gng to help me in future .

"I'm 28, had to move back in with my parents last year, and lost my girlfriend 6 months ago. I have so many regrets from my past, like quitting two different career paths which has led me to this point of being broke. And me being broke heavily contributed to losing the woman I thought I'd marry. 

Many people will say don't worry about the past, it can't be changed. Instead focus on be future. Well, I'm going back to school and will have a career that pays 70-130k depending on where I go in the country. It's not bad money, enough to live and maybe even afford a modest home, but I'll never be wealthy from it. I'll have to save and invest and work until I'm old just to have a chance at retiring. My time will never be my own, I'll be a wage slave my whole life. I have very little hope of being happy in the future, but I'm approaching 30. I can't keep putting off a career. 

""Okay then,"" some might say. ""Just focus on the present."" How can I do so with no money, no one to love and cherish, and no hope for the future? The only thing that's kept me alive are my friends. I'm thankful every day that I'm not as lonely as many other depressed people are. But it's not enough... not whenever I feel like my life is out of my control and my future is so uncertain.

"In a few hours my partner and I will get together and talk. My addiction has damaged our relationship since it stared but he has been there with me.

We love eachother more and better than before because now we can see a future together.

But I went out on saturday and relapsed. He said to me that if that happened again he was done. He couldn't deal with it anymore. I could have hidden it but believed (and I still do) that telling him was the right choice. 

I don't know what will happen but I know this. The idea of loosing him for blow, for not having had the strength to leave The party or ask for help because i will always want to do blow.

I'm aware of my seemingly lack of appreciation towards things especially the ones closely to me. Sadly it's affected my hobby which is photography and my point was to maybe see whether there's some photographers who've had those kinds of experiences, because I'm genuinely looking for help.

"Warning: Language (IDK if this is worthy of a warning or not), small mention of sex

(Note: I never meant to be a jerk to anyone. A lot of people don't see me as a jerk, and I've tried to change my actions to be kinder and better. I never tried to do any of this to impress anyone. I did it because I was naive and being a dumbass)

I'm sorry for venting I just have nobody to vent to. I've just been holding this in too long.

I've made some really dick moves and I feel like a terrible person. I've hurt people I didn't mean to hurt (I never meant to hurt anyone emotionally or physically, but I guess I didn't realize I hurt them emotionally), and I feel terrible thinking that I might have caused them to do something to themselves they might deeply regret, and I might've started some downward spiral and I feel super guilty.

When I was in 7th grade (a few years ago), I didn't know I was aroace (aromantic and asexual, lacking romantic or sexual attraction) so I felt confused and hormones were weird and shit so I got obsessed with other people's relationships because I was basically suppressing the fact that I hadn't really ever liked anyone. There was this one girl my friend and I talked to like every day in PE and I didn't think I was being a dick. Looking back, I know I was. I'm 80% sure she liked me but I didn't understand people actually lied about not liking someone. She said she hated me and I quite literally told her how much I didn't like her. She was probably lying. I was not. I was being a fucking piece of shit to her and I didn't realize it. She thought I liked her, and she thought I was lying about what I was saying.

There was another incident where she thought I liked her but it was because there was multiple threats written in the bathroom at our school and my friend and I were almost certain her and her bf did it (note: we had nothing against them. She was sweet and kind and thhe bf was a chill guy. We just had pretty good evidence and we went up to the principal, ect) so we were happy when they broke up because we thought one of them would confess. She was crying. I didn't know how much breakups were supposed to hurt. (Note: nothing bad happened at our school, just the threats. Nobody knows who wrote them.)

This one I feel the worst about. She and her bf broke up and she was bawling her eyes out for like 2 days. I wanted to show the ex-bf how much he was hurting her, so I wrote a letter to him ""from"" her. Not the best move but I was confused and naive at the time. I ended up switching the to and from names and it got given to her. I've never been so guilty and never seen someone so sad. I tried to apologize and make up, and she let me. She told me ""we're square"" and we never talked again after I did what she asked me to so we could be even.

I feel like such a dick and I never meant to hurt her but here I am. I would quite literally do anything, even sexual (again, I'm asexual. I've literally had nightmares about sex). She said we're square but I know we aren't and its been a few years but I feel so guilty I hope I never do anything like that again. I don't think I'll even be able to forgive myself and I'm now depressed but I totally deserve it for what I did. I may've been young, confused, and finding my identity, but that isn't an excuse for what I did.

"Long story short, parents have an extreme dislike for each other but it‚Äôs been pretty bad recently. Dad is verbally abusive to me, but especially to my mom. It‚Äôs gotten to the point where he will avoid her at all costs and it‚Äôs starting to affect my mental health. I just graduated from college and moved back home for a lil bit.

"I've recently turned 18 and it's been like 3 years or so that I feel depressed. I lack of everything, I barely have friends and I have several problems with finding a gf because of my interest that doesn't match the ones that generally people from my city have (I have almost had a gf that was literally the female version of me, but because of my lack of experience I bottled it just like Arsenal did in the premier league last two seasons. Other than this I have because of her serious trust issues and I can't even express my feelings). When I will finish school (in a year) I won't have any assurance in my life anymore: I'd to go to university but mainly because I wanted to increase the chance to meet new people but I don't think I will go there because I don't really like study; the other choice is working but in my country if you are not from a wealthy family you won't have a good job and I don't wanna live a monotonous life. Only thing I wanted in my life is a family with a woman that I loved (I wanted to be with that girl so bad but I think it's very difficult to make her fall in love with me again) and a work that could guarantee me to spend a lot of time with my family and friends. But it will be impossibile, I will live a very sad life, alone, with a 9-5 work that can only give me the minimum wage to live until next salary. I really hope to die as soon as possible because the only thought of living this life just kills me inside. I'm trying to do everything to end myself: I started smoking, I became careless in a lot of dangerous actions and I try not to eat whenever I can. I don't even know since when my downfall began but if I knew it was coming I would have tried harder since the beginning.",0
"I (31M) have been depressed for as long as I can remember, but it really picked up during my undergrad 10 years ago. Been in and out of therapy and medication, and nothing seems to stick for long.  
  
I find one of the most tiring aspects of this whole ordeal is socialization, in that, my mask holds up when first talking with people, and then eventually slips in some regard. People don't like depressed people, less so when they are given a good first impression. They may give a couple more chances, but overall you're viewed as overly sensitive and a downer. I have moved around and lived in many different cultures, and had many social groups I was initially part of, but it seems like only a matter of time until it flops. I find this isolation difficult, aggravating, and infuriating. It's hard sometimes to not just give in and just isolate myself, to save both myself and others the time and energy. I am currently experiencing this again in a very small city where I just want to give up on it all.

In the end, depression always finds a way to leak out, and people would rather not have to deal with that, and I would rather not have to deal with yet another footnote of evidence of why I or others are not worth it.",0

"I'm 27M and I can't really see the point in this anymore. I can't remember the last time I was happy and I always said I'll kill myself when I turn 30, but honestly I reached a point where I'll be surprised if I make it to next year. 

No one really knows the real me. I have no one to talk to, the few friends that I have left think depression is a scam and make jokes whenever the subject comes up. This didn't use to bother me but over the last few years I got close enought to open up to 2 girls. Both ended up ghosting me after about a year each. I probably would have killed myself after the first one if the second one (who I was already friends with, just not close friends) wouldn't have noticed that something is wrong with me. I finally had someone who I could be me with, and now that I lost that I don't know how to go back. It didn't used to bother me before but I was 14, the struggles were easier to handle and I didn't constantly feel that it's too late. 

Just once in this entire fucking life I wish I was enough for someone. Just once I wish someone found me attractive or interesting enough to pursue a connection with me. People usually try the ""oh but you actually are enough"", ""you do matter"", ""you'll find the right person"" bullshit but after 27 fucking years of life constantly showing me that's not true, I cannot for the life of me imagine how things would ever change. Everytime I change and make an effort it just kicks me back down from higher up. Even if by a miracle someone is attracted to me, how could I keep them close having 0 experience in dating and this huge baggage of issues. You will probably say I need to work on those issues and once they are all gone someone understanding will fall out of the sky and we'll live happily ever after. How can you fix a non existing self esteem when time and time again you gathered enough confidence to try again only for it to be destroyed in pieces smaller than before. How can I think ""Nah I can do this"" when time and time again I was shown I cannot. 

It's been 6 months since the real me was left completely alone and I honestly don't know how much longer I can reign it in and stay alive. 

That's it, just needed to rant. Don't expect anyone to read all this.

"You know, I'm a person who doesnt give a fuck even if things are serious. The reason is because Im confident that I can take care of it once it comes to bite my ass. I also have a lot of patience, so I dont mind if people will talk shit about me or even get physical, because I know I can get through this..   
  
But these days, I think I've had enough. I'm always getting suicidal thoughts (I look fine but Im mentally unstable/dying inside), the worst part is I cant talk to anyone about it since all the people around me have grown on the fact that I AM A MAN OF STEEL! I CAN DO ANYTHING AS LONG AS I PUT EFFORT AND TIME INTO IT!! THERE IS NO PROBLEM I CAN NOT SOLVE!!!!!!!!!!

But shit! Do they even know the pain I had to go through to do that..? I've been putting a lot of work and effort into things and they think I was able to do it EFFORTLESS.. They all think Im some kind of superhuman who can do fucking anything. Everytime I get serious like I wanna speak up, they all just laugh it off since they think Im joking and that I even have the balls to boast.. (They think Im being humble since I was able to do things they couldnt) 

That's why since highschool.. I bottled everything up. My problems, my stress, anxiety, you name it. I kept it to myself since no one else would listen to me talk about it. I realized that the world really is cruel.. or its just that Im with the wrong people. But the fuck can I do? I've grown attached to them too. I wanna break free and leave but.. I cant. I'm friends with almost everyone around me, if I do it.. It'd probably fuck me over. I know I said in the first part that Im confident to take care of stuff, but we're talking about PEOPLE, and not just 2 or 3, but a literal cluster of people. I dont think I can take care of something like that.

That's why.. these days I've been thinking. Should I just k!ll myself..? To just end this shit of a life.. But Im also scared. Im not ready to die but I am willing to.. Man this is just bullshit.. Why cant I live peacefully and happily like those around me..? Everyone else looks so happy to be with me but why am I not happy to be with them?

There was this one time, I fell for a girl.. I got teased and pressured by them. Wanna know what I did? Nothing. My genuine feelings for this girl got erased since I couldnt handle the pressure. Like man, cant they give me space?! I want to work my feelings with her without anyone's bullshit getting in the way.. In the end, I did try to pursue her but I could tell she was just not interested at all. Adding in the fact that I wasted my time, I just decided to completely erase the feeling of ROMANTIC LOVE. I even went out of my way to change my own perspective of LOVE. Now I just see it as some bullshit people use as an excuse to make you do their shit. It took me years to realize all of this, and let me say. The feeling of being able to not care about that shit and move on in life is amazing. 

So if you're dealing with something similar, here's my tip:

- Just dont even care, time will pass and you'll get used to it  
- If you have the confidence to change it into a happy ending, dont do it. Trust me, I tried and no one cared. (Though if your friends and family really do care about you, do it. My life is a mess so I cant really change anything since no one that I know cares about me)

"Exhausted beyond comprehension. For as long as I can remember life hasn‚Äôt felt worth living. I don‚Äôt know how I got to this point. I just remember one day in 6th grade instead of feeling insanely anxious, and paranoid and constantly freaked out and cautious from everything around me I began to instead not feel anything at all. I went numb and I‚Äôve been numb ever since. I was 12 at the time I believe, and I‚Äôm now 18 and although you could argue that it‚Äôs only been 6 years those 6 years have consisted of the majority of my life where I‚Äôm ACTUALLY conscious. I don‚Äôt know where I‚Äôm going and neither do I know where I want to go. I live a comfortable life, I have a loving family, I have two parents, I graduated with honors, I have people who love and care for me, I‚Äôm going off to college in the fall for biochemistry. I have so much going for me, there‚Äôs so much life to live so much to experience but if I‚Äôm being honest with myself I don‚Äôt care. 

Will life ever get better? Will I spend the rest of my days enduring a bleak life? Will I ever get that one thing that I‚Äôve realized that I‚Äôm missing within me but the rest of the world seems to have? Am I normal? Am I abnormal? Am I good? Am I bad? Should I live? Should I die? What do I do? I wish I knew I genuinely wish I knew.

I want to get better but it seems impossible. Im tired of pretending I‚Äôm so tired of it. I‚Äôve gone most of my life pretending im fine but I don‚Äôt know if I have it in me anymore. I don‚Äôt think I want death but I definitely don‚Äôt want this life either. Nothing feels worth it anymore, crying does nothing for me anymore and I‚Äôve come to realize that crying fixes nothing. I never feel relieved after I cry in fact I always just feel worse. I try so hard to ignore how miserable I am everyday. I try to pretend that there isn‚Äôt a parasite living within my brain and soul that is sucking the life out of me slowly day by day. 

I need help but asking for help has never worked in the past. I wish it would all just end in a second. I don‚Äôt care for myself, I don‚Äôt care to acknowledge all the small beautiful things in life, I don‚Äôt care for anything. I live day by day simply getting by. How it is I‚Äôm still alive is beyond my own understanding. Time will fly by and before I know it I‚Äôll be 30 and still in the same place I was at the age of 18, I shouldn‚Äôt make this depressing claim but this has been the case for most of the people in the world so what makes me the exception?

"Physically.. And probably mentally.. I am weak, its hard for me to get out of old habits..like skipping school, smoking weed.. Not doing the right things, but not necessarily bad things, just things that wont you anywhere. I know i am weak, what i didnt know until recently was that well, i am pathetic. I was smoking with a good friend of mine around 4 months ago, now usually i dont ask these kinds of things or bring it up because its hard for me to express myself, like REALLY hard.. Even to parents, sister, brother.. Doesn't matter i just cant bring myself to burden other people with my problems (even though it would probably help a ton just to express a bit) but i asked my friend

 ""what do you really think about me?""
Friend: ""what do you mean?""
Me: ""when you look at me, what do you think?""
Friend: ""honestly, you're pretty pathetic..""

Damn.. That hurt but.. Its true, and the truth hurts. He said i am pathetic for the same reasons i mentioned. Skipping class, smoking too much, not focused on the right things. At that time i was really sad. And i still am, but now i realize it in its fullest.

I am weak, and i am pathetic.. There is jus nothing else to it
Im a bitch.. Simple as that.. I get scared easily (though i try not to show it) by things like loud sounds, or seeing a group of people walk by (i have been jumped before by around 7 to 8 people, so you can imagine how i feel)
I got set up and robbed by my own ""friends"".. Ouch, bye bye brand new shoes and puffer. I told my mom, and she told me how she worked so hard for those.. Not too long after, i heard her crying.. Im just so weak.. I really am a loser, no doubt about it.. There was times in school (when i actually went) that i would try to fit in, but i always got clowned on.. Or just got told im corny, not funny.. Ect. 
I have a few friends as of right now including the one i asked, he wouldn't say it to me.. But he knows, and the other know what i am.. They know i am a bitch, but they wouldn't say it.. I cry easily as well, im very emotional. It doesn't take a lot for me to cry on the inside, act like everything is ok.. Then go home and cry, USUALLY. As of right now though, i a unable to cry.. Even if i try my hardest i just cant. I think i am numb. 
A numb, weak, pathetic bitch. My living situation at home isnt bad, i have a nice mom and dad.. A brother and sister as mentioned.. They care for me, and i care for them too. I have too much patience with people, even if sometimes my friends act like dicks.. I never even really bring it up.. Because i know what they could hit me with is ""and what could you do about it?"" 
Nothing.. Nothing at all.. So i just stay quiet..
I am also pretty lonely, my 1st relationship was the worst expereince ever, got used.. She admitted she used me to get over her ex, it only lastes 1 month and a few weeks but it felt genuine.. Something i haven't felt before, but nope. Gone. Oh? And she got with my best friend shortly after!! And guess what? He didnt ask me, let me know.. Or nothing, i had to figure it out myself and when i did.. I just, still didn't do anything.. Before i found out, he actually told my other friends that he asked me, and i let him.. I did not. But still, i didn't do anything..

The fact is that there's no real deeper destiny or secret meaning to the human race, and we're truly not a result of anything other than crazy chance. This tiny spinning rock in space just happened to have the perfect distance from a star and balance of elements to create and continuously support life. And we're nothing more than a bunch of clumps of cells that somehow evolved to think and, as a result, understand the utter gravity and hopelessness of this insignificance. Because it is hopeless.

And yet, we live. Nothing matters, and yet we form relationships and create art and get angry when we lose in a video game and feel nice when we're sleeping on soft things. And we create customs in which every person has their own day per year when they are celebrated for simply being alive. And we harness lightning and transport it through rocks we found in the ground just so we can be warm and have light and watch videos of other humans. And we feel enough loyalty to which part of our tiny planet we were born on or which category of other humans we are attracted to that we hang designs of cloth to represent those parts of ourselves. And we understand how little our small pocket of life matters and have moments of sadness, when the gravity of existence and obscurity places its full weight onto our chests. This sadness too, this feeling of lonely unites us. Because our world is small, but we are all living on it. Because there's a whole lot of black out there, and yet right now we are close enough to a star to bathe in its warmth and light. 

And when a billion years from now the sun goes out we will die, and that will mean none of our experiences will have had a single effect on the broader history of the universe. But still they happened, and maybe that's enough to say they mattered, at least to us. We will die but we will die together, in the same blinding flash of life, holding each other on this tiny rock surrounded by darkness and stars.

We're all going to die someday, but today we're alive, and food tastes nice, and music sounds good, and maybe that's enough reason to stay alive at least another day.",0

"I'm just sad cuz I feel like I caused my parents divorce and I feel like I will lack life skills that I would otherwise have, (dad left) I'm moving out of a rental house with my mom and sister in 3 months. I feel scared knowing my safe space that fits my hand like a glove isn't going to be there.

"I have had thoughts of suicide for over 10 years now. My little brother killed himself little over a month ago, and the girl I was in love with killed herself 7 years ago. 
I understand the pain that suicide causes really well, and I don't want to hurt others. 
If I didn't care so much about others I would have killed myself a long time ago. 
So I just end up feeling trapped. Trying to distract myself just to get through the days, while also hating myself for wasting time. 
My anxiety has taken over again and although I have all the recourses I need to make my life better, I don't want to get better. 
I want to die.

I literally enjoy nothing and right when I wake up and open my eyes I feel flooded with anxiety, and then when I open my phone all I see are ads about how to get rid of cortisol face or whatever stupid diet trend is out now . I have no money despite working harder than my parents ever did. I don‚Äôt enjoy any hobbies or music or shows and even my vices like alcohol and weed don‚Äôt do anything anymore.

"I am 40m, and I have been diagnosed with adult ADHD when I was 30 years old, and lord knows how hard I try to push myself forward, I tried everything, going to the gym regularly, meditated every morning, breaking down my tasks into small portions, setup check lists, morning routines, self-help books, therapy‚Ä¶the whole nine yards.

After a series of life altering events that occurred throughout the entire 2023 (serious auto accident, death of a loved one, betrayal of my business partner, wife of 20 years divorcing me, sudden debt, legal trouble on false accusations), I fell into deep depression and has been of antidepressants for almost a year now.

Although I‚Äôve gotten past the worst phase where I couldn‚Äôt even get out of bed, and even when I did, I just stared lifelessly at the TV, and spent most of my days planning on how to off myself, now to the point where I can begin to function, get back to work (I‚Äôm an entrepreneur and have my own small business), and live a life that mildly resembles that of my old one.

But I seem to have lost all motivation to do anything, It would take me literally hours, if not days to even write an email, and when I do, I would be mentally exhausted.  My brain would keep shouting ‚ÄúJust effing do it already!!!‚Äù Repeatedly and my body wouldn‚Äôt even budge the slightest and just kept on watching YouTube video after YouTube video.

And every night when I am in my bed, I could not stop beating myself up over doing nothing for the whole day, calling myself the nastiest of names just hoping I could shame myself into not repeating the same thing the next day, but to no avail, to the point I would bury myself in my pillow and just cry helplessly.

I know I should be more positive for the self talk, but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to, of course there are good days and bad days, but more often than not, it‚Äôs bad.

I have noticed that the suicidal thoughts have been coming back, I am truly scared I might actually give in to it, but the paralysis is preventing me from doing anything, and mostly I feel like a dead man walking.

I really want to get my life back, I want to stop acting like a bystander and watch my own business slowly die in my own hands, but I don‚Äôt know if there is any hope left for me, Im so tired and I don‚Äôt know if I have any fight left in me at the age of forty.  

I think I‚Äôm still hanging in there for my son who I love so much.  Im tearing up as I type this out, but I don‚Äôt know what to do.

"It all started on august 2018 when summer holiday ended and school started once again. I started feeling really weird, i was sad and didn't feel the strength to do anything.
There was this one day I laid in bed for 17 hours straight doing nothing and didn't eat for multiple days. I also were bullied in school and didnt have any friends and my parents were fighting almost everyday (They also abused me and my siblings when we were younger because my father was drinking a lot and depressed at the time). So I couldn't really tell my parents if I was feeling sad or if I had any other problems. That's just when I stopped doing homework at all and my grades were going downhill though I still managed to pass the classes which is quite impressive. Now, I've gotten a few friends but still, the same feeling... The numbness. Feels like my chest is heavy but also empty at the same time? I cry myself to sleep every night and honestly I'm so tired I think I can not keep on living anymore.",0

"Honestly, I don't know what compelled me to come here and post this. I think it's the fact I have no one else to talk about this with. I just feel utterly lost at the moment. I just flunked out of college, I have no money to my name, no friends, no social life in general, hate absolutely everything about myself, etc. etc. I just kind of don't know what to do with myself anymore. I think the tipping point was dropping out. I was an engineering major for 4 years and still wasn't even able to get my associates. Call it laziness or idiocy. Who knows. But now I'm in debt with nothing to show for it. A few weeks ago I broke up with my ex because things aren't going well. And by that I mean that my parents absolutely HATE him. I'm tired of arguing it about. I'm tired of having to defend my partner. And the sole reason they hate him is the fact that he's an immigrant. And unless I marry him, I don't think he'll get papers anytime soon. But I'm scared. I don't think I'm ready to get married. It seems like a big commitment. I just wish I knew what to do with my life right now. I wish I could change my name and move to another city and start over. But I'm not capable of doing anything. I just feel like such a loser. I have nothing going for me. I struggle to find a reason to keep going. Anytime I try to do anything, it always comes out wrong. Nothing ever goes how I planned it. I really thought that when I graduated high school 4 years ago, everything would be better. I would try to be social. I would put in effort into my studies. I would try to be happy. But I've spent the last 4 years being miserable. I'm just tired of feeling this way. I can't remember the last time I've felt content with my life. Will it always be this way? I try to be better. I really do. But my emotions always get the better of me. I just wish I was someone else. Anyways, thanks for reading this. I hope you have a good night ‚ô°",0
"and im feeling SO FUCKING TRIGGERED

I didn't know her, but she was really close to my best friend. we're all 24/25 y/o. she told us she was with her last night watching the match (we're from argentina) and that they were going to have dinner tonight, and now she's in the police station
she hanged herself in her house. and her dad found her

I'm wordless

i keep thinking why did she do it and not me? why if I didn't do it, she did? and how? how did she find out how to do it? what did she use? what was she thinking when preparing everything, and just before doing it?

i feel envy, confusion, i feel like I should've been the one doing it, i feel like a coward for some reason, i feel as if this happened to our group of friends, i feel as if i did it to my friends
i thought about the many many times my friends were scared about me and what could i do, i think about the moment my dad would found my body if i did it, how guilty he'd feel (i had major issues with my dad but we've been at peace for 3 or 4 years now)

it's horrible, it's a fucking nightmare and I'm so shocked and I don't know what to do with this overwhelming feeling
I couldn't stop crying before writing this

so many people died inbetween yesterday and today... one argentinian guy died just before the match, because he went to the obelisk to cheer, he climbed a thing there and then fell off it... he landed with his head
and then, like 5 or 6 people died after the match too because of fights... and now this

I can't believe how fucking unfair life is",0

"Without family or friend's support. With no meaningful connections making others feel it's worthy to help you. You are just left with whatever happened to you to deal with it with exactly zero assistance. No one would come to save you even though you've failed multiple times on self-help. It's like Darwin's theory about natural selection. We are simply the small percentage of malfunctioning individuals that's meant to be put down and die out on our own. We're deemed and doomed to be left out. But modern society values human rights, well...at least on some degree, so you're told ""YOLO your life is precious and you're loved"". But in reality it's literally and seriously just false hope only to let you keep getting tortured for even longer. We humans boast ourselves thinking we're already beyond the barbarical cruel nature out in the wild but we're still just animals. So the rules of nature still applies to us. The weak and the malfunctioning are meant to get filtered out and die. That's how simple and cruel life is and had always been this way since the dawn of time. 

So yeah. I think that's just how it is. You'd especially get to feel this when you're utterly destroyed by the pain so you're in a bad shape. In that state absolutely no one would help you even when you pay them. That's simply how stuff works and I honestly understand it.

"Is there actually recovering? I don't know, I keep cycling through different lows or layers of my own issues. Sometimes I'll think maybe it's better now but then I just fall into something else, and come out worse.

I'm genuinely concerned if my brain was just rewired wrong so early to a point that I can't fix it. If anybody has dealt with all of it as a kid, can it actually get better? Can someone talk about it?

I did therapy as a child, teen and now at 18 I'm in a recovery program. I won't go into a whole ramble but im always depressed, I just cycle through additional issues. Self harm, eating disorders, attempts etc. 

I thought I was doing better, I recovered from anorexia last year and it's almost a year since my last attempt. In actuality I've just begun abusing alcohol when self isolating, it's a Tuesday and I'm hungover and throwing up.

"Been together for just over 10 years. Husband was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when he was a teenager (Domestic violence). He's taking meds now. We've had couple's therapy from Dec to April this year.

Normally, he's an introvert, low energy but jokes around with me and communication is not an issue, very kind and mild person. If he's down, he plays some video games, watches some game videos he likes then he gets better.

The issue is when we argue about something. He either likes to blame me, and completely talking about his side. (If I focus on his side, he says something and I reply, no problem, we can communicate back and forth) But if I want to talk about my side after he's done his side, he either loses focus gets drowsy or even fall asleep, or tells me it's wrong, or calling me delusional or saying blaming me for making no sense, etc.)

Usually that gets me very frustrated and emotional then the argument gets more escalated and he either loses control calling for a divorce or leaves the house.

Today he took it out on me when the dog bit him. I said ""Don't take it out on me."" He started accusing me for not punishing the dog enough, etc. Anyways I tried to leave the conversation before it got bad. (I just said Don't talk to me until you're calm.)

In the past, i was the one that couldn't take the silence and always tried to make an nice gesture or apologize (I don't want to do that anymore. I'm so tired)

Could you help me?

1. What should i do?

"I'm so over this world. why would we continue living in this dogshit world. 

Everything in this world is a fucking joke and its affecting me in the worst way possible. I have descended into this state of being cold... I've become a cold hearted, emotionless husk that can only operate at work. Once I'm at home all i do is sit, game, eat or fantasize about a better life that is so out of reach. The feeling of daily paralysis and not being happy or content even existing is tiring. Sleep is too hard these days too. iv been awake for days just thinking. Not being able to feel emotion and feeling like there's nothing to do anymore in life but to work is just shit. Its cost me friends and is about to cost me my marriage.

Outside my 4 walls that i call home, i am continuously met with a society that cannot seem to accept one another. My very religious family is always out there to condemn every choice i ever make or have made in the past. Society is always trying to convert other people to their belief system whether that is religion, gender, political, socio-economical or even food related and the pressure of being confronted by that is just over exaggerated. Now don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their own choices regarding beliefs or gender identification but just stop laying it so thick on people especially people like me. i have had to deal enough with mental pressure/manipulation in my teenage years and now that i am almost 30 i have to continue battling my way through more mental pressure because other people cant handle the way you live your life? Absurd! 

The idealization of not existing anymore or just disappearing off the face of the earth is such a calming thing. I am diagnosed with depression, PTSD (thank you military) and i will act on my suicidal thoughts (something i have been withholding till now) if this horse shit world gets worse. ",0
"I‚Äôm so tired of people. I‚Äôm of feeling alone and isolated from the people around me. The way they act is just so cold and almost automated. Like my family just treats me as normal as if I‚Äôm not a unique person as I see all of them. When I see problems they just look at things and say, ‚Äúwe‚Äôll figure it out.‚Äù But never do. When I come home from work and no one says a word but will sit sound the dinner table and laugh and cut up for 2-3 hours. There been days where a slept almost all day until I had to go to work and no one checked up on me. There‚Äôs been weekends where I lost it in my room and I had breakdowns and panic attacks from just life and no one knew about it because no one bothered to every check up on me. Even though I check up on them all the time. Just to talk to them. I once attempted and though it failed, I was miserable for a month, I wore a jacket for obvious reasons but no one noticed or even asked about how I was doing. I would look at them sometimes for a solid 2 minutes just waiting for them to say something. But they never did. Whenever I go to them, they are always responsive but never reciprocate. Whenever someone else needs something or just wants to talk or hangout everyone is always there. They‚Äôll invite people over or go places and just be as happy as can be. But yet I‚Äôm stuck here, in my room, in my mind wondering why all these years, I was treated as nonexistent. My friends are the same way. The friends I‚Äôve had for 7+ years now. Sometimes we all get together and drink. In the last year or so, because how bad I‚Äôve gotten, I always just hit it too hard. They would ask me why im drinking like a maniac. And of course in the beginning I would just say it helps or it‚Äôs been a rough month. Sooner or later they realized it was more when a rough month become the 12-13 rough months. Yet they always just acted as normal and never really bothered to check on me. Whenever we would talk and I would try to ask for help or tell them what‚Äôs going on they just tell me how good they‚Äôre doing or they would start hanging out without me and complain that I was bringing down the mood. They once told me they all had a hangout that I couldn‚Äôt be there for and collectively they told me I was the glue of the group, like the leader and who everyone looked up to, it felt good and I loved them for it. But now it‚Äôs like they moved on from me and don‚Äôt really care. Now instead of opening up when we drink I just lash out or make comments and they always ask why do I pull away and not share myself. Why do I not reach out if I really need them. I normally don‚Äôt say anything but it‚Äôs the same with my family. Im always there for them and I‚Äôve always helped out but when I need something they seem to not be around. Like when(fake names for privacy reasons) Jared said he was hurting because his ex had passed away I was there to help him through it. I talked to him and helped him grieve. Or when Zach had family problems and I would give him advice and even come over and mediate talks with his mom. Or Sheen when he just had bad anxiety and I would come over and hang out with him, sooner or later they all worked through their problems or found solutions and im just left sitting here wondering when it‚Äôll be my turn. When do I get to reach out and get help. You know who was there for me, my best friend in middle school who ended up taking his own life. One of my exes who I stayed closed with who O.D.ed. My best fucking friend in the whole wide world who lost to a disease. Among everything else that has happened in my life every-time I‚Äôve needed the people I‚Äôm supposed to trust and care about, they always fall short no matter how good I am to them. I don‚Äôt like to talk about the dark things I have going about once when we all got wasted, we got into really heavy topics and I told them I really wanted to commit and they just said, ‚ÄúAw man, don‚Äôt do that. Just live. Just do that instead.‚Äù At this point it‚Äôs not a matter of the stereotypical, I can‚Äôt take it, there‚Äôs nothing left for me. It‚Äôs the fact that I‚Äôve come to my own personal realization that the world I came into doesn‚Äôt give 2 shits about me, the people around me have just pushed me out and don‚Äôt care about me, and the only place left that isn‚Äôt horrid and has people who want me to be are on the other side. Idk this is just something that‚Äôs been weighing on me recently.",0
"Idk why but I just have this strong feeling that my friends don‚Äôt mess with me like I mess with them. For some reason I feel left out. I feel like I get the most sass.

I just feel like I‚Äôm always there for them and I‚Äôm just this piece of garbage that gets disregarded so easily. Maybe I‚Äôm looking for myself in people. Maybe I‚Äôm just being the victim. Idk what to do anymore my head constantly turns everything around. I want to take some time to myself but I always fuck it up and say something. Idk if it‚Äôs due to me wanting attention or me just wanting to be heard. I feel fucked up in the head. I feel like a shitty person 24/7. I don‚Äôt know what to do, every step I take makes me second guess everything. It‚Äôs bleeding into my work and it‚Äôs bleeding into my friendships.

Just dealing with life lately feels like a chore. Losing interest in my hobbies and the feeling of emptiness has been slowly manifesting the last couple weeks.

It sucks to be lonely every night, questioning if there‚Äôs anybody that actually cares, to just be here and feel lost everyday. Like everybody always wants to say they care about you but when the time comes when you need them It‚Äôs always just you alone

"I'm trying to quit drinking but I get home at around 12:45AM.

What the fuck else am I supposed to do between the hours of 1AM-5AM? Just mindlessly scroll reddit, play computer games, and get drunk I guess. I'm 31 and alcohol lost its magic a long time ago. I don't really have any friends and discord doesn't really fill the social void anymore.

Fuck this shit I'm going back to the graveyard shifts. At least when I get home from work at 9AM I can walk my dog and watch TV with my dad until I go to bed. No more of this constant isolation during the dreadful hours.

"Was anyone else surprised when they got diagnosed with depression? I've had it since I was around 12-13, but was not formerly diagnosed until I was about 16. I don't understand why but I felt like I always knew it was depression, but just felt completely shocked when I was officially depressed. Ig i expected to be fine even though i cried myseld to sleep every day for a year and was deep in denial. Same thing with anxiety, which was diagnosed at the same time. I thought  I was shy, turns out it's not normal to feel like dying after walking weird or having to talk to a cashier. Does anyone else feel this way? The sense of anguish has not left me and I recall the day I was diagnosed almost every day. I grieve the person I could've been if not for my stupid brain. ",0
I just wanted to tell you all that.,0
"I‚Äôve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for many years. When I was in college for the last 6 years, it mostly stemmed from being lonely and being financially dependent on my parents. I hopped on dating apps and quickly realized how dating is simply not an option for me. I never bothered trying to date after that because I was an unemployed loser college student still dependent on mommy and daddy. Now I‚Äôm an unemployed loser college graduate that is still dependent on mommy and daddy. Fucking gross. I hate myself.

I thought things would get better. I finally graduated 7 months ago. My spirits were up. I finished with a CS degree, 4.0 GPA, and felt like I would find a decent job by now, even if it wasn‚Äôt in tech. I finally felt like I accomplished something. The reality is that I could only apply for a single job role with my degree, and I haven‚Äôt landed a single interview yet. It‚Äôs just constant and immediate rejections every damn time. People are now telling me a CS degree was a mistake and that I should have known better to major in something else. Obviously I‚Äôm a naive dumbass, especially for my age. Now I‚Äôm sitting here with a useless degree, only two irrelevant retail jobs as work experience, a 4-year employment gap‚Ä¶obviously I know to put projects on a resume for software development roles, but this doesn‚Äôt work for anything else. I have fuck all to put down. My only option lately has been to apply for jobs that don‚Äôt require a resume submission, and I‚Äôve been doing that. However, if I‚Äôm really doomed to just throw away a degree I worked 6 years for and work at McDonald‚Äôs indefinitely for the rest of my life, then what else am I supposed to do? That‚Äôs not how I want to spend my life, and I don‚Äôt see what else I‚Äôm supposed to do anymore. I‚Äôm so fucking lost.

I feel like the only right option is to kill myself. Why shouldn‚Äôt I just do it? I clearly failed at life.",0

Nobody knows how I truly feel because I feel like a burden, so I just bottle my emotions. Some days I think of just ending myself, then some days I feel so numb and everything is fine. I haven‚Äôt killed myself because I‚Äôm scared, I also have a cat and I can‚Äôt just abandon him. I wish these feelings would go away. Why am I the way I am? This post doesn‚Äôt even make sense. ",0
"To be honest, I don't even care if people are gonna read this or not, I just need to get it out.

I feel cursed. I don't know how to explain but this is how I've been feeling for now 3 years.

I feel so depressed, helpless and misunderstood that I just lost hope this feeling will leave me for ever...

I've been depressed for 1 year as a 10 y.o because of bullying and other stuff. It was so bad that at a point I had suicidal thoughts on daily basis.
I escaped this horrible soul crushing feeling somehow... or so I thought.

On the last year of middle school the same feeling comes back but this time the situation was way different.

I had A LOT of people around me but only a few actual friends. Even though I was loved from a lot of people, I felt so so lonely...
To the point that it was getting hard to fake being happy.

The reason of that?? I DON'T KNOW!!!
I mean, I lived some tough things but I went through worse.
I tried to find the reason why but was unsuccessful and I still am...

These waves last for sometimes weeks but longest was 7 months (last year).

Last year I had a whole week where it felt like I was in a constant nightmare. I felt lost, extremely tired and kinda scared for some reason.

It's been 3 years since it came back and it's killing me inside. I feel like a hole in my chest and I can't fill it.

I wanna fill it with love but even that is too much to ask for, I somehow will end up ruining it like a lot of things.

I feel like I will never experienced real love, unconditional love, mutual love. Someone always ends up getting hurt.

I feel so lonely to the point it hurts physically, 
I hate that my mother sees me being sad, I can't even express all of this to her as it will result to nothing.

I'm tired of faking, tired of failing, tired of this unbearable pain. 

Thanks for if you've read all of this.
I wish you better days than mines.",0
I'm not sure if I really qualify as depressed. I struggle with getting out of bed but that's pretty normal right. But I also really end up feeling terrible like every day. I never fail to get my important tasks done but I have no energy to take care of myself at all. But what qualifies as depression I don't really understand I've always thought it was like unable to do anything and just rotting in bed.,0
"Everyday, I wake up only to realise how much I don't want to live. I have had attempts at suicide but was never able to go through all the way because I have a debilitating fear of death. I tried to slit my wrists but chickened out at the last minute and was only left with a shallow scratch that has long since faded. I couldn't even kill myself correctly. Fucking dogshit. I genuinely hate myself more than anyone in the world and think the world would be better off without me. If only I could just stop existing, oh what I would give to do that. I don't know if I have depression, most probably I do. Never got diagnosed. Probably never will. The social stigma is too much work to deal with. I also don't want to trouble my parents. Speaking of which, I wouldn't say I have had a bad childhood, it was pretty good, I just don't know why I turned out the way I did, a fucking mistake, a freak, someone better left dead. Is this irrational? Most probably. Doesn't matter. No matter how many times someone else says that I'm a good person or that I deserve more, I can't understand it, I can't internalize it, no, I refuse to do so. They don't understand myself as well as I do, it's just pity. Heh. Pity. I hate being pitied. Unfathomable and unreasonable hate. At this point I can't remember what it felt like to be happy, I can't really say I have been ""happy"", only had moments of transient euphoria with the thought of crushing self loathing at the back of my head at all times. Forget happiness, I can't even remember what happened these past few years, I'm always in a daze. Only thing I do is distract myself from the thoughts by consuming. Consuming anything. Content. Food. Anything. I wouldn't say I'm sad, most of the time I feel nothing. Utter apathy. Devoid of a soul. However, there are times I breakdown. I shouldn't have been born. How I wish someone else, anyone else was born in my place, in place of the scum that I am. My parents deserve a better son. My teachers deserve a better student. My sibling deserves a better brother. The world deserves a better person. I am utter trash. Worthless. Less than worthless, I make things worse. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry. I don't even know what I am sorry for. That's a lie. I know what I am sorry for. I'm sorry for being a burden. I'm sorry for not being able to kill myself. I'm sorry for existing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I feel sad, I feel inconsolable grief, I shouldn't feel that, it's good that such a bad person like me suffers, but, it hurts. I'm sorry but it hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts so much. I don't know if I want to be fixed or I even deserve to. I'm tired of living, tired of existing. I hope one day I close my eyes and never wake up and hope that that day will come soon. I won't kill myself, probably, too much of a pussy to do so. But, it hurts. Please.",0
"This is kinda a vent post but I do want support to help.
I'm currently at the hospital with a sister in law having a baby. Her whole family is her and their friends. My husband's family is very conservative and they always jab at us for being alternative / emo etc. (Also I'm sad I can't have a child right due to finances  now had a miscarriageast year around this time) so I'm on edge I guess. Trying to not cry. But I'm sitting here in the waiting room and I say to my husband's mom, ""I hope they let us babysit when she is more grown I'd love to."" They look at me like wtf no. I instantly try not to cry...

Then I'm talking about how if I have a kid I'd try to get on all fours because that's better and easier for the women, it's a more natural position than laying on your back.

A family friends goes, ""omg if you have a child it be like the exorcist""

Like wtf does that mean?
That I'd scream and cry cause yes I would obviously anyone should.
Or that I'd have a demon baby cause they are mad I'm not Christian conservative. 

Either way I'm triggered in many ways and I'm trying to stay cool, meanwhile my husband is sitting there unaware to any of the slights against us. ",0

"There‚Äôs just too much pain for me to handle. I feel I either die or go insane.There have been good moments in my life but im constantly reliving the bad.It started off when I was living in Georgia. My mom had got on drugs really bad when I was 4 years old and my sister was 6.I remember her and my dad always arguing bc of it.Waking up to mom holding a knife towards dad and then screaming at each other.It was every day and every night. Along with living in a bad environment constantly getting robbed,my parents allowed a homeless guy to live with us for a while and he would lock me and my sister in a room and beat us and cover my mouth. Just alot of bad shit. Until one night my dad had enough and I remember vividly him laying with me and my sister and telling us we were leaving in the morning to Kentucky to live with my grandparents.So the next morning we woke up,threw a bunch of shit in the car and left my mom.I can remember her chasing behind us and screaming not to leave. But my dad thought that would be the best thing to do for our lives. So we made it to ky and I met my grandparents. My grandpa was my dad and uncles step dad and my mamaw was their real mom. When we first got there it took a long time to warm up. My grandpa and grandma had to drag me and my sister out of the corner and I remember just screaming I hate you and I want to kill you and I didn‚Äôt even know them.so grandpa made me pick a switch. They were very strict.Eventually we warmed up to them and settled in.Dad stayed with us there. Not long after being there my dad had decided to take me and my sister to his friends down the road and they were all drinking and playing guitar. Having a good time. Til we all eventually headed outside on the porch and in the yard. Me and my sister stayed on the porch and was hitting a punching bag. And this is where the trauma in my life got worse. Nathan. My dads friend was very drunk and I remember him walking outside with his eyes closed with a shotgun barrel to his head. Faced towards me and my sister. And boom. I remember it all. My dad tried to calm us down and say that he accidentally shot himself in the leg. But that wasn‚Äôt true. He had killed himself right in front of us.A couple months pass since that and my mom starts calling my dad saying she‚Äôs off of everything and she‚Äôs doing better. So my dad tells me and my sister he is gonna be gone for a couple of days to pick mom up. I remember hugging him balling my eyes out saying please don‚Äôt leave please don‚Äôt leave.But he had to.But then a couple days go by and he‚Äôs not back. Papaw and mamaw say he‚Äôs spending time with our mom for a while. We were extremely sad but figured we would see him again. But no. December 13,2009. My Dad had picked my mom up and on the way back got into a fatal crash and died. My mom survived. The time we thought he was staying with mom in Georgia he was actually in a coma for 6 months.The day my grandpa told me he had picked me up from daycare and my sister from school. He said there was good news and bad news. He told us to choose one or the other. We both chose good news. He said our mom is back. But wouldn‚Äôt tell us the bad news until we got home. Where my family was in the living room crying because they found out about him dying and so did we. My mother had to pull me away from the casket.She stayed for a week after the funeral. Then one morning me and sissy woke up and she wasn‚Äôt here. She had abandoned us without even saying goodbye. So now my mom is back in Georgia. On drugs even worse and me and my sister are living with my grandparents.Fast forward 3 years. Im around 8 years old my sister is 10-11.We have already been through hell but that wasn‚Äôt all.I remember I was taking a shower cleaning myself. And when I get out I hear the door sling open. It‚Äôs my grandpa. I grab a towel and try to cover my body and hes just pulling it out of my hands trying to reveal me. He had a camera. He took multiple pictures of me naked and scared. And I‚Äôd rather not know what happened with them. He also molested my sister in many different ways. We didn‚Äôt realize what he had done until we got older. I was 13 and my sister brought up something he had done and it made me realize what he did to me. So we both decided to tell my uncle. My uncle told us not to confront him or anything and seemed like he believed us. The next day at school I told my cousin Audrey about it and she started balling here eyes out and it had gotten around to the office. Eventually I‚Äôm called to the office and one of my aunts are there to pick me up. She looks angry. As soon as I get in the car she asked me very irritated ‚ÄúWhat have you and Emma been making up about my Dad? We were in middle school and she instantly shut us down. My grandpa called us crazy the family believed it  and sent my sister off to an institution and when she got back my grandpa had molested her again and I backed down completely and said it was all a lie on my part because I thought they wouldn‚Äôt love me anymore and I wouldn‚Äôt have a family.My grandma had cancer during this time and died in 2013. The whole thing had blown over not long after and we were pretty much silenced.My sister came back eventually but always snuck out and tried to find ways to not be there. So it was Me my sister and papaw. Until my sister was 18 then she was out of there. So it was just me and my grandpa.And my mind had completely tuned out everything I guess for the best to keep my sanity and not kill him.I stayed with him as his health got worse and he had gotten dementia and his liver was failing. He started forgetting everything and defecating in the floors and I had to keep a baby monitor beside him in his room and one in mine. My aunts would sometimes come check on him and ask me how he was doing and they had me take care of him and clean him up and everything.He eventually got to the point he was stuck in a hospital bed in the living room right where my grandma passed. His days did not go on much longer and I got on pills in this part of my life so it was all just a bad time. He died not long after.So I moved into my aunt and uncles but ran away and stayed at a friends the majority of the time. Sissy had her own place now and gave birth to my nephew a couple years later. I was 17 atm. My mind Was and is now in a darker place. I don‚Äôt talk to any of my aunts and uncles anymore because of our past. I am now 20 and 4 months Ago my biggest nightmare became a reality. March 25th my sister is struck by a truck right down the road from her house and Died from the impact. She was texting me 3 days before on how she doesn‚Äôt want to be here anymore. And it was just a couple weeks after she had my other nephew. She was 22 years old and suffered most of those years from the things we witnessed together. My best friend and only person who could completely understand me. She got hit in the middle of the day and it hasn‚Äôt been announced if it was an accident or not yet. The people left are the ones who silenced us and our mom who abandoned us. Which I just recently moved her down here because she doesn‚Äôt have a car and she‚Äôs addicted pretty bad. It sucks that after all these years she can be here after my sister dies but I‚Äôm still the one that had to bring her here or it wouldn‚Äôt have happened . I have chosen to forgive her even though it‚Äôs hard. But everyone in my blood seems to get taken away tragically(my full blood aunt was also hit by a car in Georgia) and I fear death is coming after me next. So while I‚Äôm here I want to be the bigger person before I go. I think of suicide a lot and it has gotten worse. But I am getting into psychiatric care here soon and I hope that might help. Either way I‚Äôm going insane and wish that me and my sister could have at least had a chance and wasnt mentally messed up from the start.Im trying not to bring destruction all around me from being so broken. I know it‚Äôs a lot to read but I wanted to be heard from somewhere. If anybody has any advice for me please let me know.  ",0
"How do y'all cope with depression, need advice on a healthier way to deal with it. Currently under influence of drugs and alcohol. Helps temporarily by numbing myself but it's not good for long term. Hoping to hearing some advice from y'all. If you're reading this I hope your pains go away.",0
"I'm 17F. I used to cut a lot before I got caught. I have a ton of scars on one of my thighs. I was supposed to enter the military. But I learned that the military will never trust me to do important, well paying jobs even with a waiver. If they even let me in in the first place since people say it's a coin flip if they decide your good enough even with a self-harm waiver, getting a psych evaluation, and lying about being suicidal . 



My original depression was from a severe vitamin D deficiency. I felt numb and disgusting all the time with a heavy feeling in my heart. I cut to cope with something I didn't understand. I didn't know why I was depressed. After getting a prescription for Vitamin D, I stopped feeling depressed and forced myself to stop cutting even though it was a horrific addiction.



I have to go tell my parents, and they will be supportive of explaining why I can't enter the military. But it's so humiliating. I wanna fucking die. They were both in both the Amy and marines and said that the benefits of specifically the air force will lead me to a better life. But I ruined it. Because I cut. 



I feel numb again. My heart feels heavy and hurt. Breathing is hard with how tight my chest feels. I wanna cut so badly. 



I have options and my parents are 100% supportive. But the military was my best shot at thriving. And I ruined it. I ruined my chance at a cheaper college experience, free Healthcare, and respect for myself. I wanna go back and change the first ever cut I made. But I can't.

"TW small mention of suicide 

I keep thinking I have my depression under control and my mental health stable. Then something bad happens and I spiral. It barely even feels like me.

For example - I have been in the hospital for physical reasons for 10 days now and was told I would get to leave today. Unfortunately I didn't get to. One extra day.  And yet I was considering turning off my life support. 

I don't understand this underlying suicidality in me because I DON'T want to die. That's why I'm here. So I can live. But... I'm so miserable here and the hospital is such a big part of my life.

"I feel like I'm going to just die and no one will remember me beyond those I personally know. They won't speak of me after my death to their kids or friends, they won't even bother remembering me for anything

I feel like my entire life is just so scientists have an ""average human"" to compare others to. Hell, everything about me is average it feels like. I'm average height, average weight, average at everything. The only things I have going for me is also things that lead to me being discriminated against, which make me stay inside all days and not get close to anyone.

I do absolutely nothing with my life beyond going to work and existing. Every so often I'll go and do something fun, but it feels like the second I leave I just go back to baseline. I feel like I should be doing more, there's so much I want to do and I just can't.

People don't like me because they can't ever relate to me. I can't ever relate to them. So I have almost no friends. I can't even tell you what I did all day today. Genuinely, it's been maybe 12 hours of me being awake and I can only tell you enough things to fill an hour. Everything else has just blended into the rest of my life. I see people my age (19) going out and having fun. They have fake IDs, they go and spend the night with a bunch of friends, they have fun, and I'm here doing nothing. I sit inside all day, sometimes talk with my 1 friend, and do nothing. 

And fuck, most of my depression isn't even about myself. I'm trans so I have to just live with the knowledge that I'll either end up homeless, jobless, a sex worker, raped, or killed. And that's not an exaggeration either, it's likely I'll end up being at least one of those things. The fact that none of that has happened to me yet is genuinely lucky. I have to live in a world I know is unjust, knowing I'll have to work until I die producing profit that I'll never see, I have to live in a world where I can't just exist without having money to justify my existence. 

Everything just feels so hopeless.",0
"Idk if it's okay to upload this kinda post, but i wanted to share it and thank all those words of support I received for my other posts here. 

It's been over a month since I haven't thought about offing myself. I used to subconsciously daydream stuff like a rope tightening around my neck, as it felt liberating, but now I am not having such thoughts since sometime.

I am not keeping up a rigid routine or trying to commit to anything, only trying to keep up the basic hygiene routines like brushing and bathing every day. If I don't feel like doing any other chore of the day, I don't force myself to do it and neither feel bad about myself.

I am trying to be loving and forgiving to myself.

I am also planning to slowly commit to people. 

I hope I keep this up.

I do not worry much either.

I wish no one loses their hope.

Its all okay, whatever you are feeling is valid. If u dont like anything, that is okay. If you are tired to get out of bed, that's okay. Everything is okay. Try to love yourself a bit. Even if that's not possible, it's okay.

You are not alone.

I have boxes in my room as in March I was supposed to move out, but plans changed and I‚Äôm still stuck living with him. I know I need to be better at keeping my area clean, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do. I feel like a child when I‚Äôm 23.

He‚Äôs been very patient about me cleaning it and he feels I‚Äôm blatantly disrespecting him for not doing it. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm harbouring trash, I just don‚Äôt have any motivation to do anything other than go to work and come home.

"I had a falling out with a guy I was talking to a while ago and Ive still been pretty upset and confused about the situation because he sent a lot of mixed messages claiming that he cared about me but acting another way. I asked my friend what his take was and he just said that the guy just didn‚Äôt care that much and ‚ÄúIf people care enough they will act in a way to show that and think about the other person when trying to show it so that the other person can be aware of their efforts.‚Äù So I said ‚Äúthat would mean you didn‚Äôt care much about me either.‚Äù He said yeah and went on to say he cares more about other things but doesn‚Äôt mean he has 0 care for me. He hasn‚Äôt treated me that great in the past and I have a history of abuse and a lot of toxic relationships where I was treated poorly, so this stung a lot. It made me reevaluate a lot of my relationships in the past and I realize that most people in my life have not really cared about me. It‚Äôs hard to accept and I‚Äôm struggling a lot with this. I really need help and advice or something to get through this. ",0

i live on a closed and private urbanization of condos, and around 6:40 pm the group chat of the urbanization went crazy. people were asking to help someone and for someone to please call ambulance. that‚Äôs when i we (my parents and i) started hearing someone screaming outside.

this was a woman, she was crying hard. she was screaming: ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt let this be true‚Äù, ‚Äúsomebody please tell me that is a nightmare‚Äù, ‚Äúplease tell me that my daughter is well‚Äù. all the neighbors were around her trying to help. people called the police and the ambulance, she kept crying and screaming. 

after a few minutes a white car appeared and entered really fast until it came close to the woman screaming. it stopped abruptly and people got out of it. it was family of the girl and her mom.

people approached to the house. 

when the police came, they entered. i was talking to a neighbor who had more context of what was going on. it seems the girl already had some mental health problems. he told me that her mom entered the house but didn‚Äôt found her anywhere -the sad thing is, she‚Äôs a 27 year old that has a baby of 12 to 18 months i would say- she found the baby on the bed undressed (he‚Äôs okay) and the bathroom door locked. she started knocking on it but no answer. that‚Äôs when she realized what was going on and started to cry for help.

around that time the neighbor was telling me that, another of the neighbors happened to be a nurse, so when the police came, the nurse, a cop and a familiar of the girl went into the house. one of them went down and told us to please keep calling the ambulance; the girl seemed to don‚Äôt have any pulse.

they returned upstairs and a few minutes later the ambulance arrived. they came downstairs and statutes saying that she needed reanimation. minutes after, she regained pulse.

it seems she took pills, we don‚Äôt know how much and since how long.

they took her out of the house the ambulance runed away with her. that was at around 7:40 pm. we haven‚Äôt heard anything yet. (it‚Äôs 10:47 pm we i am)


this is the first time i experience this kind of situation and my head is spinning. hearing the mom screaming, watching her family rushing in, the police, the ambulance coming in and taking her out‚Ä¶ but what striked me the most was watching her baby in the arms of her husband and thinking: how could you do that to him? (i don‚Äôt mean to judge) i felt so sad for that little boy‚Ä¶ as i said she appeared to be alive when they took her away, i hope she is. i hope all the family is okay. i don‚Äôt know what she was going through but i hope she recovers and get to see her son and her husband.

if you are having thoughts or if you are in a bad place please seek help, please talk to somebody. there is people out there that loves you, even if you feel that there isn‚Äôt i can guarantee you that somewhere out there there is somebody that loves you. things will get worse before they start to get better, so please keep fighting, you‚Äôre gonna make it , you‚Äôre gonna pull through it, you‚Äôre gonna be okay, everything is gonna be okay.

"Broke up with my girlfriend of seven years about about 4 months ago. Seven was our special numbers so I was going to propose July. I feel as if I did it because I was depressed and I lost myself and I lost trust because I caught her lying so many times about silly things. Started to feel I lost us and we were arguing a lot and one day I just snapped. I have been regretting it.

Then lost my job, which I had a really great opportunity at, and it was purely due. The reason I was depressed from the break up, and I couldn‚Äôt get myself out of bed for a couple weeks. I feel like I‚Äôve just been drinking and being sad and I‚Äôve tried to eat healthy and go outside and be with people and I just felt depressed and sick like I‚Äôm not myself anymore.

I‚Äôve always had depression, yet I‚Äôve always dealt with it very well. I moved out of the house early on Was fairly successful. I don‚Äôt get the chance to visit my parents very much. I always knew my mom is a wine drinker but these past four years. I‚Äôve slowly seen her basically kill herself with alcohol. This last year was just got really bad and I feel like I‚Äôve already lost her. 

I‚Äôm a big mama boy I can‚Äôt even have a normal conversation with her anymore, she can‚Äôt walk, and she is starting get dementia from drinking so much. This Mother‚Äôs Day she called me by the wrong name and was totally out of it. Life has just been moving so fast. I feel like I didn‚Äôt even notice it and she was the best supportive mom growing up so I just don‚Äôt understand what happened. Recently, she asked me to go get a gun and kill her, and I didn‚Äôt I didn‚Äôt even know what to say and just left it just broke me. In and out of rehab have costed me and my dad so much and she just doesn‚Äôt wanna get better. I feel as if I‚Äôm gonna lose her any day now.

And then I had two friends commit suicide one last month, one this month and I had no idea if their struggles. The first you know was rough cause he had four kids so I just basically tried my hardest to help take care of everything for them, but it was a rough process. Then just last week my buddy shot himself and left a note which I was mentioned in. His mother asked me to write a eulogy for his funeral. This is his one of my close friends who I would come to you when I was down, and he was the best at working me through it. I couldn‚Äôt find the words, but I eventually did and I wrote it and then when it was time to go up and read it, I couldn‚Äôt even speak a word and had to have someone read it for me.

I have a lot of close friends that love me and then I can talk to, but for some reason, I am so embarrassed and have a hard time opening up other people I don‚Äôt want to see the weakness. I‚Äôve always been really confident and I‚Äôve just lost myself and I don‚Äôt really know who the fuck I am anymore. I‚Äôm only 25 years old and I feel like I dealt with my depression great with hobbies and staying busy. But this year has just crushed me and I don‚Äôt even know what to say or what to do. I started a new business which is going well and I have a second job so I‚Äôm helping out with a lot of family financial problems. Yet I hate myself and I hate my life, I feel I lost myself along time ago and now I just covered up with drugs.

It feels like rockbottom and that‚Äôs not even all of it. I‚Äôm trying to keep it short. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôve came to myself so much and I‚Äôve tried therapy, but I just filled so disconnected. I miss my ex-girlfriend and she needs time alone and I feel stupid for letting her go. I‚Äôm looking for support and advice because I feel broken and wanna get better but I still just sit here and weep every day.

Where is the light at the end of the tunnel? ",0
"I'm in my early 20s soon to begin the mid age, ever since I was 13 or 12'ish I knew this person who I cared about, I won't get deep into it but we have so much history together and we were super close and know a lot about each other, but I'll be honest, fuck this guy, entering adulthood I've tried be a supportive girlfriend when we dated, a supportive bestfriend when we broke off the relationship and came to terms with it, managing to still be good friends through in and through out. But fuck when it got tense it got tense, I don't feel right giving people space when they're upset (unless they state it themselves or hint it as best as they can without putting it into words) so I'd be the one to try and cheer him up as much as I could even if it really did seem like it never did much at all (though he'd tell me otherwise and say it would.) 

We hung out every day or almost every day for years, so it could get draining when either of us spiraled into a bad mood for whatever reason, yeah he'd try here and there but I'd say when it came to helping the other feel better I was good or at least, effortful when it came to it, I loved him so much just as the person he was regardless of his flaws and I looked passed his cold demeanor he'd put on sometimes. I am pretty much crying because I just dished out so much for this fucking guy who in the last moments of what I really do assume was our friendship, he couldn't look past me just being a fucking human and being overwhelmed with something we were working on together, I may have sucked at the communication bit but he got so fucking angry at me simply for just being overwhelmed? I tried man. 

Where he was lonely I tried introducing him to friends, where he was upset financially I'd offer him what advice I could offer that seemed realistic at best for what little experience I have with it. I admit at some point there was a falloff with how clingy I was with him and I admit to obviously being immature when we were younger but I have matured since then, so much so I'd say that maybe I am more mature than him, I recognize and don't blame people anymore for feeling emotions- the way he definitely-fucking-does, and maybe- this is just assuming on his side; he just didn't like seeing me become and grow into my own person- in the sense that I wasn't basically dependent on him for learning things and being the only friend I had because I eventually made new friends years later (I'd say, when I turned 22 I started opening up more etc) after being a loner aside from him being my only friend for practically my whole life and me living through abusive family trauma, plus a side dish of even more trauma outside of family for days on end; lasting for years which he definitely knows my life history because he was and I say without exaggerating- my other half, he knows more about me than my own mother probably does (that's how close we were.)

Anyways, some stuff went down between me and him last year that left a scar on our friendship, where he decided to disconnect from me and our mutual bestfriend at the time, the bridges he tried burning left me to drop being friends with that other friend shared between us. I missed him every day for months, but I tried looking past it to finish school because I wasn't gonna let people who left me hurting so much stop me from graduating; and just around the time I finished school, he had tried talking to me a few things for lesser important things, eventually I had managed to reconnect us as friends, and him opening up and reconnect with his other friends because he tried doing a self isolating thing, which I immediately recognized as destructive and unnecessary but still forgave him for it because I was not a stranger to doing self destructive things myself. 

Any who- yeah, I looked past it even though it was an awful time for me, we were friends as usual again etc. I thought everything was alright and maybe after that went down- I thought we learned to be more understanding basically of each other, but nope. Rewind to around May, me and him get the idea to work on something together, blah blah blah, I eventually start feeling extremely overwhelmed easily but I am afraid to let him know that, so instead of telling him how I feel I try and rub it off instead of talking to him (because, I have a history of being a people pleaser- I don't want to upset him) he eventually asks to talk to me about the thing we were working on, I tell him how I was feeling, he lets me know basically that he was frustrated with me, the conversation on his half feels colder, I thought we were just talking things out but nope, he lets me genuinely know that he really just frustrated with me when I thought he'd be understanding and not lash out at me for being overwhelmed as I have stated to him- multiple times, so I'm like- ""Ok, I will give you space, sorry."" at that point forward we are half ways done through May into June, he hasn't said a damn word to me while making it very obvious he is just doing literally anything else, I know his schedule too so like- ??? There would've been no fucking reason for him to cold shoulder me and give me the silent treatment since our argument in the middle of the month, I give it some deep thought like- ""Yeah- wow, I really fucked up he really just isn't talking to me at all."" 

I vent to my other friends that he just isn't talking to me so while I confide in my other friends for guidance and support; I actually let my other friends know if this guy doesn't talk to me into the next month of June, I'm just cutting him off because what's the point? I feel scolded for having emotions in a fun project that wasn't even taking off yet and was really just in discussion phase. There was nothing being lost yet- at least to me; though in our argument he pointed his finger at me and said some shit like ""You have an income; I don't"" so I guess I was actually obligated to work on it with him or something, even though I tried being there for this guy while he tried looking for a job and shit though that never went anywhere. Lol... alright man. Anyways, it's pretty much June now, I just let him know what's what, I leave him with the details of our project because he just seemed more passionate about it than I was at this point and I just cut him off because this guy was just so fucking unforgiving, I think to myself that that's it- and a side of relief but also a hint of shame, that shame grew because I didn't feel right carving him out of my life but I really didn't know what else to do when the guy who I cared so much about didn't talk to me for the rest of the month of May.  Skip to a few days ago where I reached out to just talk to each other, see if maybe we can just hear each other's side. At this point I don't expect anything anymore, other than to just hear it out and MAYBE be understanding, but I don't even think that happened. I feel like all these years were genuinely wasted because in my newer closer friendships, I just can't give as much enthusiasm and care that I gave to this one person who I considered my other half. All the hours and attention and care and support I definitely fucking gave feels like it was going into a garbage chute with nothing to gain but shitty compost- in other words. I feel like this guy just left me with nothing but hot steamy shit on my chest. It is my friends birthday today (the one I met around Christmas), (not the guy who I've been venting about) but I feel like I just couldn't provide enough celebration and positive attention to him because I feel just a dark cloud of depression looming over me right now. I feel like shit man, I can't win no matter where I think I'm getting better I'm really not, I want to cry so fucking much, so many years of expending so much energy on this guy. I don't know if me and him will ever pick back up to the spot we were in before the project when we were good friends with each other. I'm too much of a people pleaser to be thinking about someone who cold shouldered me for half the month of May and never was understanding about what \*\*I\*\* was dealing with or HAVE dealt with when I gave him basically all I could ever offer another person. Insane, I'm so fucking tired. I want to off myself most days, I feel like a decayed corpse with nothing left to offer to anyone because I am sucked fucking dry. Just a lifeless doll with nothing but thoughts of my traumatic past I feel like I will never heal from and I am sorry to anyone who is friends with someone like me. 

Basically I am a damaged lovebug who gave too much to the wrong person, and who is now scared of love.",0

"I'm 37 years old, and for the past 5 years, I've had trouble fully relaxing. I don't experience panic attacks or severe stress, but I'm constantly in a slight state of tension and mild anxiety, which is really draining. I've always believed that fear is a strong motivator, and over these past 5 years, I've accomplished more than ever before. I completely gave up alcohol, saved enough to buy an apartment, paid off my car, started a second small business, maintained stable earnings, and improved my cardio fitness. However, I'm now mentally exhausted, experiencing depressive episodes, struggling to get out of bed, and withdrawing from social life.

I want to be able to relax again like I did when I was 24, to worry less while still being motivated to achieve new goals.

My question is, will antidepressants help me care less and restore that relaxed state? I'm afraid that if I start taking these medications, I'll become lazy and lose my drive. In the past, when I was around 20-25, I took SSRIs, but they caused significant mood swings.",0

"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm reaching out because I‚Äôm desperate for help and advice regarding my partner's severe depression. We‚Äôve been together for 5 years, and while their depression and suicidal ideation have been mostly manageable, things have recently taken a steep downward spiral. Their suicidal thoughts are now constant, and we are in a state of crisis.

They have been switching medications, but nothing seems to be working. This has led to multiple trips to the ER, and we are desperate to find a medication that will provide some relief or at least a glimmer of hope. Unfortunately, inpatient treatment isn‚Äôt an option due to a previous terrible experience they had (the psychiatrist repeatedly forgot their prescriptions, they were exposed to other patients having meltdowns, and overall, it made things worse).

We live together, and they don‚Äôt have many friends they can lean on. I work full-time remotely, but I‚Äôm running on fumes trying to take care of them, maintain my job, and care for our pets. They have daily panic attacks and meltdowns, and I feel like I‚Äôm reaching my breaking point. Despite this, my instinct is to continue supporting them, as it feels like their life depends on me being there for them.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you cope and what steps did you take to help your partner? Any advice, resources, or just words of support would be greatly appreciated.

 Thank you. ",0
I dont want to live anymore. I‚Äôve never felt loved by anyone and everyone who hasn‚Äôt ignored me has just given up on me . I dont know what‚Äôs wrong with me and I keep doing everything wrong.

During elementary I‚Äôve been told that I‚Äôm an embarrassment and that no one likes me.

The thing is my life isnt as bad as others. I have a job, earns enough money to live month to month, have some friends i talk to here and there and have parents who love me.

However i cant stop the negative thoughts everyday and my head has been hurting, even in moments i should be happy i start thinking negatively. 

My main negative thought is that im scared to be alone / single forever, ive been single all my life but now its scary, i take care of my body and health, the only one issue is im short (5ft4) and never get anyone notice me romantically.
Also ive been feeling very numb, dont feel many emotions plus i feel like i dont enjoy my job but also dont know what to change to and cant risk  getting pay cut. I dont have anyone to talk to so i feel like all my bottled emotions have been coming out this year through crying etc.

I just dont know what to do with my life or my crying, i feel so empty.

Went to the doctor who said I have depression. Colour me surprised. I was put on medication. My dad doesn't believe in therapy and since I spent my life savings on my dog's treatment and have yet to get my documentation in order for a new job in my profession I do not have money to get a therapist. I was asked by both remaining members of my core family the above. They also added the fact that they miss the old me. So far I have chosen to respond to the one using film and tv quotes since he doesn't want to hear anything negative. To my dad who I live with I respond when spoken to. To his girlfriend I am polite especially when she keeps saying men are like this. The family dog is a good listener though. She has yet to offer advice. I just needed to vent. Thank you. ",0
I dont know. My heads pretty messed up lately. Im still in high school but actually moves schools in November 2023. My old school was a really good school but was far from my house. I was pretty popular there and it was fun to be there and just overall a great experience. I had made quite a few close and loyal friendships and life was good. This all changed when i moved schools. Now my new school is in Centrale London whereas the last one was Kent. two VERY different places. My new school is a state school. My old school was a grammar school. Now i moved because of the travelling issue as my dad had to drive one hour to get to school. Now to my new school i just take a train. Now one thing is that the school is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy smaller than my old school. it makes things feel cramped and congested all the time and i have nowhere to breathe. although the drugs/vapes/smoking/pollution in the air doesnt really help either. Just to say but my school is a whole year academically behind. Ive been TRYING to study hard but that is hard to do as ive gained a new sense of laziness. Ive been making no friends as everyone in the school is just toxic and i mean TOXIC. The downright play their own friends and insult them with no filter ofr apologie or even a 'im just kidding'. It just makes you feel like sh1t. Ive been constantly stomped on and made fun of by my cleassmates even though i do litterally nothing and try not to draw attention to myself and i envy the kids who arent brought to the topic of the conversations. People gossip about me at every corner and mix up my words on purpose to get something interesting. ive tried to make friends and it worked fine at first but then they kept on insulting me or saying im annoying or calling me weird. People try to get me in detention constantly even saying their name is my name so my name is put down for detention. Theres been a bunch more stuff happening that ive needed to talk to someone abput but for now my parents are coming upstairs and i cant let them see this. I may follow with an update if i have time perhaps,0
"My bf and I have been dating for 2 months now but before we started dating he used to self isolate whenever he was feeling anxious/depressed (he's been clinicaly diagnosed as depressed)
 I've been made to believe that if a guy loves you, he can't go a day without talking to you.
This is my first time dating a clinically diagnosed depressed person. He told me that he's just gonna go to his self isolation mode because he's been feeling anxious lately (because of his work applications). I just want to ask if this kind of relationship where we don't talk because of depression is normal?",0
"I'll just be surrounded by trees and cows and be happy. But I'm pretty sure being depressed is more complicated than that. But what if leaving everything behind truly fixes me? I love the people in my life. I just hate myself in my life. So if I have a different life I should be fixed right? 

I'm too much of a coward though. I don't want to make anyone sad. And I have no money to do so. How would this even work? ""Hi I'm depressed please let me take care of your cows and sheep and let me live on your property. I'll clean and cook I promise I'll work hard!"" ",0
"I have to be the most empty person on the planet.

It‚Äôs a long story to how I got to this point, but I was extremely selfish and lazy as a child, and completely lacked any social skills (still fail in that regard)

I had zero real friends in middle and high school since I was so easily angered and couldn‚Äôt even initiate a conversation, I lacked any and all empathy for others, and due to my after school job in my last two years, I couldn‚Äôt do any extracurricular activities.

Sadly, I completely wasted my college years feeling scared I wasn‚Äôt going to pass for every moment of every day, and barely ever did anything else but cope behind a screen alone when I wasn‚Äôt studying. The pandemic really put me into this habit, and I sadly never got out of it. I had zero friends and wasn‚Äôt able to get any experience. I literally cried out of hopelessness during my graduation ceremony a year ago, and had to move back in with my parents. I was unemployed for months until finally getting a full time beginner job, which I now can‚Äôt stand, and I have completely lost interest in my major (i already felt such way during my final year of college)

It‚Äôs been slightly a year since my graduation, and my attention span for any sort of productivity is so low that I just spend any time out of work crying and feeling empty thinking about how I messed up so badly.

A few weekends ago, I came to a full realization about how everything went so wrong and have told myself I will change, but since then I haven‚Äôt even been able to put in the effort to find someone to help me.

It‚Äôs all my fault. I‚Äôm a horrible person.",0

I know we both have trauma from shity lives, like foster care and family abuse. but I've been so close to blowing up on him to get over it like I did but that would be hypocritical and wrong. it's been every little thing and now he feels like he's begging for love, mostly I believe its because I am asexual, and rarely take him up on advances. I know I'm the cause of this cause I know that it's not right to project my mental problems onto him, and worse having an alter that hates being alive for me with a passion. honestly I don't know how to help him if I'm battling my self and my minds. any advice on how to make sure he feels loved and receives the proper emotional care?",0

"doesn't matter much since im planning on ending it next month but it's the nail in the coffin at this point. been depressed for 4 years at this point with no end in sight, and have basically let every single aspect of my life fall apart (dropped out of school, ended my relationship, cut off my friends) in a state of complete numb emptiness. my job was the only part of my life that wasn't a total wreck. i'd put a fuck ton of effort into getting my dream internship in a really competitive field last year and did well enough to get a return offer for this summer. depression has been beating my fucking ass. constantly exhausted, unresponsive, every symptom under the sun, literally the only thing i can think abt is ending things. i've barely been getting out of bed most days for the past year, and i was an idiot to think i'd be able to hold down a stable job this summer. stopped caring about anything, stopped even bothering to open my work laptop, stopped doing much of anything other than thinking abt killing myself and whatever else the bare minimum entails. got fired, obviously. distantly it feels devastating ‚Äî¬†i worked so insanely hard for this and i would've gotten a full-time job offer from it had i not just dropped off the face of the fucking earth ‚Äî¬†but concretely all it's done is made killing myself that much more inevitable. 

i've stopped talking to my friends and have to lie to my parents abt this for the rest of the summer bc i obv can't tell them i've lost my job. so reddit is the only place i can put this lol. first post, sorry if this isn't the right type of post for this sub",0

"Bonjour a tous

Besoin de parler du v√©cu qui est actuellement en train d'arriver et n'arrive plus √† surmonter

Pour r√©sumer ma situation j'ai 36 ans une compagne de 36 ans √©galement avec qui nous sommes fusionnel, une entreprise de 7 salari√©s avec un salaire confortable, une vie simple d'entrepreneur qui roulait parfaitement 

Mais il y a 2 mois tout c'est √©croul√© subitement, mon activit√© c'est brutalement stopp√©, l'administration m'ayant retir√© les autorisations me permettant de travailler... et tout cela √† cause notamment de MES propres erreurs et prise de d√©cisions catastrophique 

Ne pouvant quasi plus travailler j'ai malheureusement d√ª licencier le personnel et doit faire face √† de multiples probl√®mes : proc√©dure judiciaire en cours, forte amende (en centaine voir millions d'euros), licenciement des salari√©s, prison mais vraisemblablement sursis, contr√¥le fiscal j'ai fais que de la merde avec ma soci√©t√©, impossibilit√© de payer les charges √† venir, liquidation judiciaire, faillite personnel... Bref une erreurs que que je risque de payer toute mon existence

Depuis ma vie est devenu un v√©ritable enfer, je vis dans le stress permanent; je ne dors plus que sous Stilnox et sous Lexomil, je n'ai plus le go√ªt √† rien, je suis en d√©pression s√©v√®re et n'ai que des id√©es noirs...

Je passe mon temps √† ruminer, me dire que j'aurais d√ª faire ci faire √ßa, comment j'en suis arriv√© l√†, j'en veux √† tout le monde alors que le seul fautif est MOI MEME

J'ai perdu toute la confiance et complicit√© que j'avais avec ma compagne (l'une des rares chose qui me rendait heureux), nous allons perdre notre maison notre s√©curit√© financi√®re et surtout notre amour qui ne survivra certainement pas √† cette √©preuve

Je suis en train de sombrer et ai bien peur de ne pas pouvoir assumer toutes les probl√®mes qui risquent d'arriver. 

Pour les personnes ayant subi ce genre d'√©preuve comment avez vous fait pour affronter ce type d'√©v√©nement? Comment y faire face? ",0

"I (23F) have struggled with anxiety and depression for what feels like my entire life. However, I am scared it will never get better. Every time it starts to feel like it is getting better, something shifts in my brain or something happens that triggers my 'symptoms' again. I am really struggling.

I feel ungrateful and hate myself for the fact that I struggle. Don't get me wrong, I am not super well off. I am a first generation university student who is barely scraping by on the little money I get but I still know that some people would kill to be where I am.

Just today, I got flown out to a different city by a big law firm for vacation work. They are paying my flights, accommodation and meals for an entire week. Still, I can't feel better and I try. I really do. I try to remind myself that everything is okay and that I should enjoy myself and this wonderful experience. I can't. Something in my brain feels wrong and I feel like it is seeping out of me in a very noticeable way. Most of the other students here kind of look at me like I am a joke and I feel like its because they can notice how sick I feel on the inside.

"If my abusers could feel what I feel on a daily basis, they'd kill themselves. I'm honestly surprised I even made it to the age I am now, it's probably thanks to maladaptive daydreaming, but still. I'm more surprised I wake up every morning to go to work, I constantly think about ending it all. 

Not once in my life has anyone given me positive reinforcement. Not one person ever tried to nurture my intelligence into something functional and useful, despite spending every waking moment since 6 years old working towards that goal. All I wanted is stability and friends, is that too much to ask for?

If my shitty ass family, coworkers, friends could live only an hour in my shoes, they'd commit suicide. Being completely isolated from everyone since birth is not something that should happen to anybody. 

Sometimes, I wish I could make them feel what I feel. My pain. I want to see the look of horror in their eyes when they have to face the inevitability of knowimg that they're not better than everyone else, that they're wrong, and that they can't handle the pain I carry on a daily basis. The undeniable truth that they can't simply ignore, insult, or abuse their way out of.

I am sick of everything. I'm tired of being abused. I try to be nice and reach out to people, do things with them, but it keeps happening. I can't keep bottling everything in anymore for the sake of everyone else. I am going to explode one day.",0

"I live in my apartment alone this summer because I am doing research for my university. I go into work for around 6 hours a day and relax when I get home. There are few people in the apartment this summer, but sometimes, I hear footsteps outside my door, and when I do, my heart races so damn fast. The funny thing is I have absolutely ZERO fear about the person trying to break in or kill me, but it is more the fear that they are going to see me by myself wasting away by myself. It is the worst when I am high by myself and I see myself as less than I am. Idk if this is caused by childhood trauma or poor self image, but my brain literally goes into fight or flight mode. I feel a panic attack coming on and then when the footsteps leave, I feel so relaxed right after as if my life had been spared. Can anyone related?

"It‚Äôs like a repeating pattern in my life. It‚Äôs so predictable I can write a step-by-step guide.

Someone befriends me, I get attached, then they ask for (what seems to me at the time like) a small favour. I do the favour, the person likes the results, so they ask for another favour a little bit bigger than the last one. I do it, they like the results again, then they ask again because they know I‚Äôm not going to say no. They know I‚Äôll do it because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre my friend, of course I‚Äôll help them‚Äù.

This happens over and over until I finally realize what‚Äôs going on. When the time comes, I express my concerns to them nicely. They act like it‚Äôs no big deal, like they understand and will change. I believe they will change, because they‚Äôre my friend. So I become blind to them continuing with the same old behaviour until I realize and talk to them again. Repeat this step a few times.

When it gets to the point where I‚Äôve finally had enough, I express my concerns to them again, this time leaving no room for alternative interpretation. Then they gaslight me, act like they‚Äôve been reasonable and I‚Äôm the crazy one, then actively go out of their way to avoid me for a bit.

If they know even the slightest thing about my mental health, they also act like it‚Äôs because of that too.

Is it really crazy or make me mentally unwell to not want to be treated like a soccer ball? Because that‚Äôs what I feel like. I feel like I‚Äôve been kicked and passed around by all these people for various reasons, them all knowing what I‚Äôm like and that I don‚Äôt know how to say no.

And then when I do say no it‚Äôs like all hell breaks loose and I‚Äôm suddenly worth nothing to them anymore.

It honestly just really fucking hurts. I feel so fucking disposable.",0
"I was doing so good for maybe a year. I had moved out on my own, got a car, had a job that I somewhat enjoyed. Now a year later, it‚Äôs going to shit. The same job I‚Äôve had for two years is fucking me over. 2 shifts this week but the plumbing went out. So I got about 4.5 hours instead of 12. Then this next schedule, 3 shifts. I‚Äôm fucked. My hours had been slowly ripped from me. It was 6 then 5 then 4 and now 2 or 3. Everything I‚Äôve worked hard for, budgeted for, skipped hanging out with friends when I‚Äôm 21 and young and should be having fun but I wanted to be responsible. I have never bought anything crazy. I haven‚Äôt gotten myself clothes in over a year. I rent an apartment. I got the cheapest car for the payments. I tried so hard. And for something that isn‚Äôt even my fault, it‚Äôs gonna go away. It‚Äôs all gonna be gone. My little safe haven of an apartment. My shitty car that took me to and from work. I‚Äôm gonna have to give my dog up. And what makes it worse, is my older sister makes the schedule. She knows I‚Äôm already struggling. She gave my hours to her bf. He has 5 days a week and has been a manager for like 1.5 months. I called up my other sister, wanting to day drink. Her phone is off so I‚Äôm alone in my apartment drinking. The thought of taking my pain pills from my surgery a few months back has crossed my mind a few times. I‚Äôd rather die than lose all of my progress. I‚Äôm already negative in my bank account. I might make $300 this paycheck and probably $200 the next. Not even enough for my rent. I worked so hard, just for it to be gone from something I can‚Äôt even control.

"I feel so broken inside that nothing seems enough to mend the pieces. I feel like I am the sum of my mistakes, failures, and regrets. Except for a few days, it has been a very long time since I have felt peace. I've carried this heavy heart for as long as I can remember. The depth of my sadness knows no bounds, yet it feels hypocritical, as I have never faced true loss, never had to go hungry, beg, or feel violated. There are so many good things in my life, yet I am unable to be grateful for them. Only when I lose them do I understand how much I care and how much they mean to me. And I always lose them.

I am never able to express my love and affection for the people who stood by me in the darkest times. I fail to treasure them and respect their value. I lie here sad and broken, fully aware that I have hurt people terribly. Though I might not have done it intentionally, I did nothing to stop it. I've made decisions and choices for which there is no one to blame but myself. I have always hurt people, leaving them disappointed and sad. I can't think of one relationship in my life where this hasn't happened. I have hurt myself too, making terrible decisions that led to many mistakes.

I feel like I have not achieved anything in my life. Even now, I am afraid I am indulging in self-pity. This terrible feeling of sadness, guilt, shame, regret, and loneliness just does not seem to go away. And why would it? I have not been a good son, brother, friend, family member, or boyfriend. I have failed both in my personal and professional life. I lie here heartbroken, knowing I have caused so much pain and suffering.

I have hurt someone I truly love, and I don't know how to feel bad, because it is not me who suffered because of my actions. Now, I am alone, having broken all relationships. I don't have a friend to talk to or a girlfriend to share my heart with. The loneliness feels like a huge weight on me, one that I can't shed no matter what I do. I have not treated myself right. I have been undisciplined, inconsistent, and careless about myself, the people in my life, my feelings, and my life. I have chased impulsivity and short-term gratification.

I have not respected others or taken care of them because I have not respected or taken care of myself. Sometimes, I wish I could just fulfill all my responsibilities and make my parents happy, because after that, I might be able to end the suffering completely. Because I cannot take much of this anymore.

I want to look at the ocean again and feel peace. I want to laugh and dance when I feel the rain on my face. I want to enjoy the wonders of the world. I just want to stop feeling so worthless and aimless. I want to become a better person who can contribute meaningfully through his work to the world, and who is able to love and be loved in return.",0
i feel like shit. if it makes me feel better why should i try. its genuinely the only fucking time i feel truly happy i‚Äôm not posting this as a ‚Äúill go ahead and self harm it‚Äôs perfectly ok yay!!!‚Äù thing i‚Äôm genuinely asking what‚Äôs the fucking point of trying to stop,0
"I am the reason why I don't have friends or anyone who slightly like me. I'm liar who blames others for my own mistakes. People don't usually leave me since they are good people. I leave them and ghost them. I don't have any affection or love to give. Maybe I was born empty. Crazy thing is my whole family was/ is so loving towards me but I just turned out as an empty vessel of human. 

My whole life was a mess and failure because of me. I've been hurting everyone around me. How do I stay living with myself?",0
Does anyone else feel like a burden and need to end their current relationship. What was the aftermath and how did your partner deal with it that helped you,0
"Why would i want to be a male? it‚Äôs so lonely and limiting and i constantly feel worthless because i‚Äôm not what people want me to be i‚Äôm not masculine and everytime i pretend to be i feel so hollow and tired.  

If i could become a woman i wouldn‚Äôt for a milisecond reconsider then i‚Äôd be valuable, free to be whatever i am, free to just exist in my body without feeling so bad about how it moves or looks, i could get all the comfort i‚Äôd want and no one would call me weak and pathetic. Everyday is a constant struggle i hardly maintained my sanity when i went to the store all those people around me looking at my disgusting body they most likely hate me and i increasingly see them (and all of humanity) as vapid and worthless. 

I feel like screaming my body feels so wrong so disgustingly prison-like. My mom keeps getting pissed at me for feeling the way i do like i have power over it i don‚Äôt if i did i‚Äôd never feel this way.

I don‚Äôt feel as suicidal as i did a few years ago but everything feels disgusting, absurd, scary, and uncanny.

"(F22) I find it weird that I was just normal and fuctioning earlier and upon going home, the guard whom I'm kinda close with, smiled at me and I smiled back and then she said, ""Are you okay? It feels like you're not okay.""

I admit that I wasn't my usual excited self today but I didn't think that I wasn't okay. On the commute home, I started feeling this overwhelming feeling of lack of motivation. And I took a shower and now, I lied down on my bed and I started sobbing. Not crying, not tearing up; but sobbing... Idk if Im just tired or what.",0

I guess I just needed to vent that because I'm tired and hurt by her response. It's not easy to ask for help in the first place. Then, when the response is so patronizing... it feels even more pointless and difficult.",0
"I am in my thirties and was diagnosed with severe depression on december, 2023. What broke me and made me go to the psychiatrist was that my ideation day failed, not for mental reasons. I couldn't work, eat and for the first time in my life I felt lonely.

I am on meds since then. In march I felt really good, never in my whole life I felt so good, could think better, talk better, could describe if food was good or bad, and for the first time I had a moment in my life that I could describe as happiness. I was able to go do lots of exams (bloos test), everything is good. Walked for 4 hours in one day. Wrapped a birthday gift for my best friend. Could describe how good or bad a food was, never been a picky eater. Went out with all my friends. Was able to do 6 sets of all my workout routine everyday in 1 hour, 12 exercises divided in 3 supersets. Cleaning my whole house was easy.

The best expression to explain it was cloud nine.

One month later, things got worse again. Less energy, harder to concentrate and think, harder to do basic things, crying more, went to 6 sets everyday to 3 sets and then 1, and somedays I wasn't able to workout. I go out with my friends and feel nothing, on that stage that no one wants to see that I am not good, so I just pretend that things are okay.

Doctor increased meds and changed to ""stronger"" and expensive meds. It has been 3 months and It didn't get better. Some weeks ago someone recomended L Citrulline and helped a bit, but not extraordinary.

I am losing my hope, I feel that the ""feel good phase"" wasn't normal and I will never experience it again. I am currently off work since december, not receiving any money from my country social service. I will run out of money in some months, and planing a date again.

I am posting this because in my lurking experience here and on other social medias, I have never seen anyone describe that feel good moment that lasted only days or weeks.

I know that people like to say that it will get better and that I am still on the beginning of my treatment, I am here to read this.

Please be honest, if you have severe depression, did you had this experience? Were you able to feel that again? And what other non conventional (not breaking any post rules) made a difference?",0
"First post here hope it's ok.. 
I'm on summer vacation and I've basically been ghosting everyone since July started pretty much, most people didn't even notice, but the people who did text me (like 1 person I'd say) I just do not have it in me. I don't have the energy to be like ""heyyy what's upp"" or whatever. If they'd need me I'd be here, but only if they'd say they need to talk. I can't just have small talks rn. I'm exhausted to my bones. My family cannot understand for the life of them why I'm not doing anything like meeting with friends or finding a job or whatever but I honestly just don't feel like I have it in me. I can laugh and stuff with them sometimes. But I need to be home. My friend asked if I'm mad and that she doesn't understand what ""I don't have it in me"" means (from what she saw on my TikTok) and I don't have the energy to make excuses. I can't even get myself to answer an online friend who thinks I did something to myself.
Not that anyone cares.
I don't know what to do anymore. 
No one understands.

"turning 20 made me realize that i‚Äôve been depressed with almost no relief for 10 years. i first went to therapy when i was 10 and started back up when i was a junior in high school. for the remainder of high school, i did therapy 2-3 times a week for most of the time. i tried holistic supplements and eventually had to go on antidepressants when i started college. im on my 4th combination and i had to stop bc they made me more suicidal than before.  i was looking forward to the change, but i never really made any lasting friends besides my roommate who i am still very thankful for. my sophomore year, i decided to live in a dorm alone bc i thought it would give me more time alone to do practice my guitar and write. it was just far from my classes and everyone i met. by october of last year, i decided to drop out. i burnt myself out in high school and tried to go for a good degree in college but i couldn‚Äôt handle it. i did a 200 hour yoga teacher training bc i couldn‚Äôt let myself do nothing for the time i went home. got a job at a cafe too. i didn‚Äôt rest as much as i wanted to. yoga became a chore instead of a method to help me cope, and now i have extreme anxiety around teaching and everyone is expecting me to start now. i signed a lease that i can‚Äôt escape and im moving back to my college town. everyone is excited for me but i can‚Äôt find a way to be hopeful. every time ive tried to be, i still end up in the same situation. i‚Äôm always the odd one out. i was at least excited to live by my boyfriend, but he‚Äôs moving for a job and we will have to be long distance still. outside of my personal life i feel like i have so much awareness around how rigged the world is. i will never be rich enough to afford my basic necessities bc i don‚Äôt dream of having a job. there‚Äôs not much i feel passionate about besides music and i don‚Äôt feel i can succeed enough to make money. i feel like ill be stuck working these stupid low wage service jobs forever. i feel like my life is over. i feel even worse thinking about how all my mom wants is a happy and healthy kid. the peace i got earlier when i was driving on the highway, listening to ‚Äútelephone line‚Äù by ELO on full blast thinking about driving into a wall at full speed was the closest to happiness ive felt. i know i will traumatize people by killing myself so i just pray that i get a terminal illness. don‚Äôt know if anyone will read this but i just haven‚Äôt been able to go to therapy bc of my job and don‚Äôt feel like i can be honest with anyone else",0

"NOTE: I have not been diagnosed with Depression. However I do suspect myself of having it and don't know where else to post this.

I (a 16M) am struggling a lot right now for a lot of reasons. I have no hobbies and don't take  an interest in anything. As an Autistic person that's unheard of, so to fit in with the Autistic community I faked a special interest in history for months. Speaking of Autism, because of  it I struggle with socialising and therefore hate every*one* alongside every*thing*. I have really bad self-esteem issues. I want to be an author yet can't spell the most basic of words, can't think of any ideas for books and have the world's worst handwriting. However I think my biggest issue is my deadbeat dad.

My dad an alcoholic and he chose alcohol over me. My dad didn't love me enough to choose me over some drinks at bar. Only now that I'm typing this do I realise how entitled I am, but it's how I feel nonetheless. I saw him on and off until 2022 and he was always mentally unstable. He would always yell at some small random thing I did, even when I was little. If I trust what I've heard (which I honestly don't since humans do nothing but manipulate) he also hit his children when he still lived with us, before he got kicked out, before he chose alcohol over me.

All this has made me feel so depressed. I would have committed suicide by now if I wasn't such a coward. Does anyone here know a quick, safe way of committing suicide? I'd greatly appreciate it if someone told me.",0

After years of depressive episodes I've been on a recovery journey since last year and rn I feel as good as I haven't felt in forever. But there is one thing that's still missing: a dream. Something that excites me, makes me want to get up in the morning, something I want to live for. I wonder if losing this is just part of growing up.

"I live a perfectly good life, with loving parents and a lot of friends. From the outside there is nothing wrong with my life. Nothing to justify these feelings I'm feeling. The thing about me is that I can't get work done, nor can I focus on anything. This has led to a lot of arguments with my parents, who are more traditional so they wouldn't understand if I told them that I just can't focus, or can't do all my homework. It's hard to explain what I mean. Lately they've spent a lot of money on a summer math course and Invisalign for me. I'm talking like thousands. But my stupid ass can't be consistent, and I stop wearing the Invisalign and doing the math course. I KNOW its important for me to do, but I CANT do them from some reason. Its like a unbeatable laziness that I can't overcome. I just end up slacking off at the end, or thinking to myself I'll do it tomorrow. It's horrible and I hate it and I know its bad but I just can't stop it. I just don't wanna do anything anymore. This has led to my Invisalign being cancelled because the dentist just think I don't wanna wear it anymore, my parents STILL have to pay full price even if im not wearing it and I can tell they are just dissapointed in me. But I can't explain to them the situation I am in of not wanting to do anything because I can't explain to myself either. Its just this looming overwhelming feeling of just not wanting to do anything and turn off my brain to scroll on instagram all day. With my traditionalist parents of course they blame everything on my phone, meaning they think that because I'm on my phone I don't do any work, which is what it is exactly at face value. But they don't know plus won't understand that even without my phone I wouldn't want to do these thing EVEN though I know how important they are. I can't explain why and I hate myself for it. I just want to stop living and disregard all these things so this constant battle in my brain would stop. But I also don't want to kill myself because I know that would devastate my parents and since I'm from a Christian household, be against the faith. Plus it's not like my life is horrible and compared to other people, why would anyone want to kill themselves if they were in my shoes? If I were to die in my sleep tomorrow I would be fine with it, im scared what would happen to my parents who already have a shaky relationship and my little sister though. But on the flip side I don't know how much longer I can continue this mental battle of not wanting to do anything but needing to do it, which ends up in, me forcing myself to do it and feeling miserable while doing it. I feel like im wasting money, time, and taking my parents patience and love for granted, and I don't know how to explain this to my parents. So i'm here ranting it out seeing what ygs have to say. Sorry if it's a bit confusing or messy I kinda just typed thoughts as they popped up.

I don't want to live anymore. On top of that, I'm a short a guy and always made fun of. I was bullied since the start of middle school, maybe even earlier. I haven't told my family, because they are very marrow-minded; especially my parents, in particular my dad. I'm because I have a ""nerdy"" attitude, although I'm not a teacher's pet, and because I'm short and weak, even if I work out. I don't eat as often, I don't care about my appearance, I don't shower as often as I did. This is going on for like 3 months. But I probably had depression since a really young age. I think I'm stupid, but when I realize I'm not I try to say stupid to enforce my vision. I didn't ever have a bright life, but my best moment was probably when I started liking my crush.

"If this isn‚Äôt the place for this, it can be taken down.


I 33f am married to 37m
We have a little one.

We have been together 11 years.

In the beginning it was great, I was happy, I was in love.

Shortly after having our daughter I developed pretty bad PPD and tried to get help but the meds just made me worse.

We moved far away from family and I was left alone dealing with PPD and an infant 16 hours a day, every day.

During this time living across the country from family, he abused me. It was only the one time, but it‚Äôs stayed with me ever since. 

Fast forward to today and I have basically been raising ‚Äúour‚Äù child alone for the past 8 years. I work, but I also do all the work of a SAHM. My child even comes to work with me (which I am grateful was even an option as childcare is not cheap so this was a financial relief.)

I have chronic depression. My earliest memory of me having depression I was 4.
I also over the years developed anxiety and CPTSD from sexual assault.
I go to a trauma therapist and yes it‚Äôs working, but I have a lot to work through. My husband knows this and yet provides me no help or relief from my every day tasks.

I cook dinner, he does not. So the trade was he‚Äôs to do dishes. They‚Äôll sit in the sink for days, and if I complain, I‚Äôm the asshole.

Suddenly our child has started having bouts of severe anxiety and it‚Äôs been hard to handle as I cannot get through to her to help her. 
I set up both a doctors appointment and therapy for her. Again, with no input or help from my husband.

Last night as soon as it was bedtime my child started having bad anxiety.
Now I also have a chronic illness that causes me to be in full body pain and aches pretty much 24/7 and it makes me exhausted.  
So when she started I myself started to break down.

I have so much on my shoulders. I do everything for my child, husband, our pets, the home, and I put myself last because I have no other choice.

I got up and went to get my laundry and saw that the stuff I just treated myself to was covered in black ink from a pen my husband left in his pants. And I lost it. It was the straw that broke the camels back.

I had a full on mental break and panic attack.

My husband‚Äôs way of consoling me?
‚ÄúKnock it off and stop fucking up her (out daughter) life!‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt believe it. I could not believe he said that to me. After everything I have done and sacrificed for him and our family.
(And for context my daughter is absolutely attached at the hip to me, not him.) it was one of the most hurtful things he‚Äôs ever said to me, especially since he knows that with my own mental health I already feel I‚Äôm a POS mom for being depressed 24/7

I don‚Äôt want to be alive anymore, but I also can‚Äôt do that to my baby. The guilt comes in heavy with the mere idea of offing myself because of how often my husband has called me selfish for even having those thoughts as a parent.

I know I of course didn‚Äôt give you our full history, but that‚Äôs the gist of our relationship. I have retaliated against his words and actions towards me and he knows exactly what to do to gaslight me into insanity.

I want to just leave and start a new life and be in a better head space with my baby, but I financially don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd even do that. I also have no family to turn to.

I am stuck and I am depressed to the point of a numbing disassociation.

I don‚Äôt know what to do.  ",0
"I am currently in college for computer science. This is the first break that I haven't taken extracurricular classes. I took both winter and summer classes just to catch up in my degree because there's an expectation to already have a lot of credits by default in order to graduate in 4 years. Despite this, I'm behind by about a semester worth of classes. 

I live at home and commute 50 minutes both ways everyday because renting is just so expensive. My mom has told me things before, like that college wasn't that bad for her. I don't think she realizes the difference in degree difficulties. She went to school for teaching. Her job is probably harder than mine will be but at the moment, what I'm doing is just a lot more mentally taxing. 

Everyday I come out of my room, and she tells me that I should get a job and am being lazy, but this is literally the only mental break I've had for years and feel like I'm being bullied anytime I come near her. I feel like this resentment I have for her is building up now, and I don't think I could really explain to her that everyday when I drive home from school, I think of driving off the bridge and ending myself because I am so miserable.",0

"Just stared at a sunrise and felt absolutely nothing.

Checked a bunch of things off a to do list and had no sense of accomplishment.

Money has brought me no joy.

Exercise barely does anything anymore.

Food has lost all taste.

Alcohol only makes the memories worse.

Working only makes the realizations worse.

There is nothing left. I can't escape the memories and the realizations.

"Sorry I just needed to rant because my have nowhere else to turn to.

I am struggling massively with my mental health, to the point of just feeling exhausted and not present, I‚Äôm worn out and just done with everything, especially my job. I‚Äôm just feeling so lost and a failure in life and it weighs on me.

I‚Äôve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for years now, but I‚Äôm very high functioning and very good at hiding it,so on the outside, I look perfectly ok, but I just feel like I‚Äôm unrevealing now and I don‚Äôt even know where to begin to pick up the pieces. I‚Äôve e had counselling and CBT which helped but I still struggle so deeply, I‚Äôve never had medication, I don‚Äôt know what to do. My GP is aware of my struggles and put me on the waitlist for NHS talking therapy, but I still on the list.

I dread my job, I work in the public sector/local government in education so it‚Äôs very high pressure, heavy caseload. I‚Äôve handed in my notice which is 3 months from now, so I will be leaving soon. I‚Äôm going to take a break from working and just focus on my studies and pursue my masters degree, so I haven‚Äôt completely left without something lined up.

But Irecently got a complaint from a parent that sent me in a downward spiral with my mental health and from that, I‚Äôve not been right. A family member of mine passed away and that triggered it even further. I wasn‚Äôt given bereavement leave by my manager, so I‚Äôve been calling in sick, I‚Äôve been off work sick for a week already due to go back this week.

I have no one to turn to, my manager at work isn‚Äôt helpful, she‚Äôs lovely but she doesn‚Äôt know how to support me whenever I mention I struggle with my mental health. There is no signposting to services that can help at my workplace, there is no ‚Äòhow can I help,‚Äô nothing. She isn‚Äôt mean, but I dread engaging with her about it. 

My family are not the best to talk about these things so I keep it to myself. 

I don‚Äôt know how to feel better.",0
This is my first Reddit post and I guess I‚Äôm here to ask if anyone feels like a failure at their age. I just turned 27 and I don‚Äôt have a career. I‚Äôve had jobs my whole life but no longer than 2 years due to how horrible the places turn out to be and I just can‚Äôt take it anymore and I find a new one and then pay is an issue. I went to school and all these places want to pay me 13-15$ an hour when I was making 17-18$ an hour. I live with my bf who can take care of us for now but it‚Äôs not the point. I feel lazy and pathetic for the last 4 years because I‚Äôm always in and out of a job. I refuse to be treated like garbage for minimum wage and now it‚Äôs to the point I don‚Äôt even want to try to find a job because how scared I am to just get screwed over again. Can someone please just give me some advice. ,0

I feel very sorry and shame of me but I feel even more sorry for my family, I'm sorry that they have me as a daughter and sister because they don't deserve this. I know that I am sick and ill but I do not understand when it was that everything changed so much and that everything became rotting in my head, I am filled with the despair of knowing that there is probably nothing or anyone who can help me and it generates so much anxiety to know that i am alone in this. I really don't know who I am I don't know who my head is because sometimes I feel like I'm several people, I don't know if I'm what I think, what I feel, or what I do. What do I do?

It‚Äôs honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn‚Äôt even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that‚Äôs even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it‚Äôs better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i‚Äôm the same as them, as if we‚Äôre all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it‚Äôs because their so mad at the other person‚Äôs opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn‚Äôt that mean you‚Äôve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I‚Äôm not an object. I definitely take it too far though, punching the wall, screaming, and destroying things are not normal emotions. To top that off, I am stuck in a constant eating disorder, starved until I couldn‚Äôt, ate until I exploded, I prefer the skinny side of me, I liked my body at least. Back to sadness‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt been able to explain it to anyone else what im feeling, to explain it on the deepest level I can, what I feel (maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic) is death, although I dont know what death feels like I assume its like getting old, or being on your death bed, my depression is like waiting to die, everyday not getting up to do anything, never being happy, not having anyone worry or miss you, that‚Äôs what death is overall. I seem normal on the outside, besides my arms (yes I mean that) but that‚Äôs only because if I cant even handle the beat down from myself, I dont know what‚Äôd I do if I had to endure hate from the outside world, that‚Äôs one of the scariest things in my opinion.",0

"Hey guys, I'm going to sound super weird when writing this. Yet, I feel like this is my last option in trying to get help or ways to take the first step to loving myself and feeling normal.

I (26M) have dealt with Body Dismorphia since I started Middle School. However, all I do is lay around and mope in bed. I still live with my mom and all I have to show for my life right now is a horrendous hourly pay.

"I've written this post twice now after taking too long and losing it.  I'm going to be as brief as possible, while still trying to cover everything.  Mainly the advice I need is at the end.

I've been with my (46M) girlfriend (36F) for 3 and a half years.  I haven't been a good boyfriend.  I've lied about some pretty big things, and I've compounded lie on top of lie.  I was previously married in a loveless and toxic marriage that I am still struggling to end, but I lied to her and told her that it was final.  When she asked to see the decree, I continued to lie, delaying the inevitable. She knows now, and even though the divorce arbitration is moving forward, it doesn't fix the lies.

I had a close friendship with someone from my previous job, that was inappropriate.  Really inappropriate.  It wasn't cheating, physically or emotionally, neither of us wanted anything like that, but we did exchange racy and sexual text messages with each other, memes and pornographic pictures from the internet, nothing ever personal, and some of this did overlap into the beginning of my relationship with my girlfriend.  My girlfriend found out and I deleted all the messages from my phone, out of shame, and fear, and disgust with myself.  I forgot that they were even there because it had been so long ago, but once she found one of them, it all came back and I panicked.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to restore them so she can read them all and get closure.

We are trying to work things out, I think most of the work needs to be done by me.  I am in therapy, both personal and couples', trying to be better.  My psychologist wants to diagnose me with Borderline Personality Disorder, but I'm not sure that completely explains everything.  It's a work in progress.  I just want to move forward and I don't want to lie ever again, and I want everything to go back to normal.

That's where the anxiety is.  I overthink and I self-punish.  I go from 0 to 1000 at the drop of a pin and I am inconsolable.  I am terrified that I'm losing her, that I have already lost her, that she's going to find someone else less problematic.  And part of me knows that that probably would be the best thing for her, to be loved by someone that would never lie or hurt her.  It would end me though.  It would completely destroy me.  She tells me that she still loves me, and still wants to be with me, and make this work, but she can never trust me again.  Even if we work through all this, I can't see how she ever could, and I don't blame her.  Not one bit.  And without trust, how can there be love?  Real love?  And in my head, I don't know if she really needs ME or does she just need someone, and am I in the way?  She wants to meet new people, for friendships and I agree that she should.  I think she should get out and find that support system that I'll never be comfortable finding for myself.  She says that she's not looking for dates, or someone new, or even casual throwaway sex to fill the void that I caused, but that fear exists.  I know how special she is, even if she doesn't, and I know other people will see it too.  And I'm going to lose her, if I haven't already.

We have ups and downs.  Some days we are still madly in love and all over each other physically.  Some days are the complete opposite, cold, quiet, filled with hurt.  It's the yo-yo that hurts the worst, and causes the most anxiety.  Waiting for the shoe to drop that she found someone.  That it already happened.  And it's over.  It eats at me inside and I can't seem to make it stop.  I go for days without eating or drinking, sleeping.  I've lost over 15 pounds in two weeks and my clothes don't fit anymore. I just don't know how to stop accelerating things in my own mind, or how to stop hurting myself and focus on trying to fix the here and now.  I was on Paxil 10mg once a day for a while, but they don't work and I'm pill avoidant anyway.  I don't know what to do and I need help and I feel like I don't deserve any.  I want her and I feel like I don't deserve her.",0

"I don‚Äôt know how to put this into words but here‚Äôs what I‚Äôm dealing with:

Severe Misophonia, chronic back pain(unknown cause, dozen of unsuccessful treatments over the course of about 7 years), severe social anxiety- literally zero friends whatsoever, religious disagreement with family, frequent headaches, depression, (thankfully mild most of the time, except every week or so when I get lonely and it smacks me in the face and tells me I have nothing of value to offer to anyone and no future) and no life skills/degree or employment of any kind.

 I have also never had sex/kissed/held hands/been on a date in my life. I can literally only think of one time a girl my age even hugged me.  It was about 7 years ago (when my life was just starting to fall apart) and she only hugged me because she was a very friendly/affectionate kind of person and we happen to be in the same group at Mormon youth conference thing (she hugged everyone goodbye). We barely ever spoke to each other and I don‚Äôt even remember her name. 

I have plenty to be thankful for too, or at least I *should* be, but somehow that just makes me feel like I‚Äôm even more useless for not being able to get my life together. Anyway the positives are:

Parents (still married and in a good relationship) are supportive with my struggles, other than the religion thing. They‚Äôre VERY Mormon/LDS and cannot accept that I don‚Äôt believe anymore. (I stopped at around 16).

I managed to get my driver‚Äôs license and GED after dropping out of school in 10th grade.(due to the back pain and misophonia)

Good financial situation. Of course I‚Äôm completely dependent on my parents(which makes me feel worthless sometimes) while we‚Äôre not exactly rich, we‚Äôre probably middle to maybe upper middle class, by the standards here in the US. 

Depression is also not quite as bad as it was at 16-17, in large part due to therapy. 

The thing is, all my problems compound on each other. 
Want to get a job? Well I can‚Äôt because my back is going to demand I lay down after 30 minutes of sitting, standing or walking. But why try when it‚Äôs going to send my anxiety through the roof? And what is someone triggers my misophonia, so I just sitting there, suffering with extreme rage, while my body pumps me full of all the hormones it thinks I need to be prepared for my imminent death?

So what if I work from home then? How many jobs are there that let me work as few and as erratic hours as I need to manage the pain, while also minimizing social interaction? Oh and all I have for my resume is a GED and zero previous employment. 

How do I make friends when I have nowhere to go? No school, college, church or workplace. Not to mention I live in the dead center of the mormoniest part of Utah. I‚Äôm instantly going to be an outsider, as an agnostic-ish person. I‚Äôm not even anti-Mormon or looking to get into arguments or anything. People aren‚Äôt mean about it, but there‚Äôs always that slight distance between us.(which my social anxiety insists will ruin everything)

What about friends online? I have had some people I played online games with in the past, and had some I would call friends. But they didn‚Äôt last. Like all of my other friendships, they were shallow, I think because I suck at taking interest in other people, and we drifted apart. 

That‚Äôs only half the problem though, because my mom dislikes online game relationships . I‚Äôm not forbidden from playing games with people online, and she has actual agreed that it could be good for me to interact with people like that. The thing is, I have no privacy. Most of the day, it‚Äôs just me and my mom in the house, where she could overhear anything I say, or walk in at any moment. It‚Äôs not like I plan on doing anything she would disapprove of, but my anxiety doesn‚Äôt care. Even now, if she walks into the room while I‚Äôm just watching a harmless youtube video my heart rate spikes. So anytime I try to play online games with people there‚Äôs this stress that my mom is listening to and judging everything I say. Not to mention it‚Äôs just awkward to have your mom there while you‚Äôre trying to hang out with your friends.

The religion thing is at a stable but mutually unsatisfying stalemate. It makes interacting with my siblings awkward, and I usually avoid my extended family as best I can. My parents occasionally preach to me a little and everyday I have to read a page of the Book of Mormon and come to family prayer. I put up with it because they made it clear that those are the rules in this house and I figured it‚Äôs the least I can do considering how much they‚Äôve worked to try to help me, not to mention raising me. 

The thing is, I sometimes hate it here. I hate living in this beautiful house with loving parents, free food, free WiFi and minimal responsibilities. I want to do something. I don‚Äôt know what because I‚Äôm not good at anything and every time I leave I am rewarded with physical and emotional suffering. I‚Äôm so socially defunct that I can‚Äôt hold a conversation with anyone, not that I get many opportunities to. But even being very inverted I get really lonely when I learn something cool and have no one to share it with, or when I need advice and have no one who can relate to me or when I realize that on my current trajectory, I‚Äôll never fall in love, let alone get married and start a family. 

I‚Äôm not sure why I‚Äôm posting this, I guess it‚Äôs easier to be honest if I‚Äôm anonymous. I‚Äôve thought about doing something like this before but I was paranoid that someone I know will find it and know it was me. I am still paranoid, but once I actually wrote this out I decided to just post it anyway. I don‚Äôt know if I want pity or advice, or just some actual meaningful human interaction, but every year that passes it gets harder to ignore the fact that I have no idea what I am going to do with my life. It feels like there's nothing I can do. ",0

I just feel dead. I've been so depressed these last few days. I just want to die. I can't think of any good reason to keep going. Life is not worth it at all. I'm so tired, can't stay motivated or see a reason to bother with much of anything.

I hate this life. Modern life is absolutely soul sucking and barbaric. I feel as though nobody cares about me at all and it's mostly true outside of family.

There really is nothing you can do. I'm going to therapy but that's doing nothing. I'm so emotionally numb to everything now.

All I want is to die, die a death where no body gets to know that it was a sucide.

"I want to give up.

I'm 15. For a third of my life I've been battling with depression. For all that time, my mother verbally abused me about my mental health. The first time I was admitted to the pysch ward, she didn't visit me the entire time. I didn't get any diagnosises or medication due to her wishes.  The second time, last time, I was put onto a treatment order to basically force my mum into giving me treatment. We went to this mental health tribunal and she said that made her realise that I had issues.   
  
I'm discharged now. My mum's acting weirdly nice, saying that we both hurt each other (me telling people she was abusive and having mental breakdowns) and that we should move on. I'm taking medication, which she supervises. But I'm so done. I don't have the strength to keep on going, to keep on fighting. I think the last straw was my discharge, where I literally locked myself in the bathroom and screamed that I didn't want to go home. But they made me.

I just wanna stop taking meds, stop going to therapy, and wait out my chance to kill myself. But for the first time ever, I felt pleasure and genuinely smiled. But I'm done. I'm sorry, but I'm done. I'm so so done. 

I guess this is goodbye.",0

"I just really don't. I'm a 21 year old female and I've tried for years to give myself stupid reasons to stay alive. ""It gets better"" wasn't cutting it anymore so I was telling myself stuff like ""I want to see season 2 of this show I love. I need to see if my theories were correct, I can't die yet"", ""I'm so looking forward to the next spider verse movie I can't go yet"", ""Oh I can't die till the broncos make the playoffs"" or ""I have to see the broncos win another Superbowl! I could achieve immortality with that wait"" 

Just these last months have just been hard. My eating disorder has come back aggressively, and I know subconsciously it's my suicide, the suicide I can control. I want to die I don't eat. I want to live I eat. 

 I feel my friends couldn't give a shit about me. My cat ran away and not one friend could be bothered to talk to me to help me through it. I went through a death last year. Same thing not one friend cared. I'm always the back up friend. I'm the friend people only give a shit about when everyone is busy. 

I took a year off of college to get a job but I can't get any job and I've applied for over 20 jobs. I keep seeing articles talking about how no one wants to hire Gen z so now I'm panicking no one will hire me ever.

 So I'm sick of being sick, I feel like none of my friends could care less if I died, I feel like a deadbeat failure that I can't get a job and an idiot because I was at best a C student in school. I know people go through worse so I feel like a bigger POS I feel this way. 

I have a really hard time talking about these things in real life because I either want to avoid this topic like the plague or joke about it like it doesn't bother me. I kinda did it a little in this post with the ""immortality"" comment. I feel like it makes it harder for people to understand I need help because I can't say it. I can only say it to a bunch of strangers I know I'll never meet.

"It happened yesterday morning. We have been together 3-4 months and everything‚Äôs been amazing, it‚Äôs not often I find a connection with someone. 
The past week or she has been struggling with depression, she has been noticeably struggling with needing space and I given it to her whenever she asks and however much she needs. It always ends with her wanting to be near me and holding her.
A couple days ago she had a tough day and really opened up to me and I listened and told her I was there there for. She kept saying how amazing and grateful she was to have me as a boyfriend.
Yesterday morning she woke up and we talked on the phone about meeting up because we had plans and she wanted to see me, her words, but after a few minutes when we‚Äôre gettting ready and her kitten just pooped on her carpet she started spiraling about she didn‚Äôt wanna drive and that I deserved better and that she‚Äôs bringing me down and destroying my life. Eventually we broke up but I made sure she knew I disagreed. 
We agreed to meet up next weekend to exchange stuff. 

Now a day later, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how she spiraled and maybe I should‚Äôve told her to take a second cool down and that she didn‚Äôt have to drive I‚Äôll come see her. I just really miss her already and I hate losing a relationship to something over than just incompatibility. We were so amazing together even for the short time we were together ",0
"Hi, good morning/afternoon/evening. I'm writing this post to ask for your opinion on my behaviour.

For some months I've been taking SSRIs (Serotonin Recapture Inhibitors) which help me control my mind and depressive thoughts. The ones I take work really well. Although I need to give it a psychological push to keep working sometimes, but that's expected.

Now, I had to stop taking it because of ""reasons"", and my brain has slowly become depressed again, and although I feel sad and depressed more easily, I also feel more... Free, I feel like I am the real me, I feel like I'm really feeling, I'm really in touch with my own feelings and don't feel the need force myself to feel (or even be) a certain way.

With this, the dilemma arises - To be, or to not be depressed? 

While with SSRIs I am more physically free (my body doesn't get anxious as easily, or depressed which leaves me tired and not wanting to do anything, or worse...) and more productive with my life, I also feel like I'm suffocating myself emotionally, because, even though SSRIs do let me feel sad and sometimes even ""depressed"", I still feel like I'm not being the real me, and instead feeling and doing what is expected of me.

Thinking about this scares me a little. Even though, the answer should be obvious, I also think about what's going to happen later in life if I do keep taking these.

What do you think?",0
"Idk every day it's getting worse I don't have any friends and I don't trust anyone anymore. I forgot how I talk to people I just repeat the same patterns when speaking to people.

I don't like it anymore I just hope it gets better when I'm away from my parents. No actually my mum she hates me she never spent time with me. She always argues with me. They will move soon and she forces me to help them because if I don't she will cut me out of her will. But I can't help she wants to renovate the old house of my Grandma but it's basically a ruin. And she said I'm not allowed to see my bf during that time because I have to help the whole weekend. I have no will to live I have no energy I'm a 1,77m girl with 45kg I can't help renovate a house for half a year with no free time. I work every day till 6. I just turned 18 and she expects me to move even though I won't have time. I hate her. The only though that keeps me going is that maybe I'm in the right and she's terrible. But idk I'm wrong I'm horrible I'm a lazy asshole. But I still hate her more she tells me my bf is a narcissist all the time. He's a bit stupid but not a narcissist and she talks in on me for hours daily she won't stop till I agree he's an asshole. Or that I'm an asshole. I've not once argued with her.

It‚Äôs honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn‚Äôt even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that‚Äôs even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it‚Äôs better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i‚Äôm the same as them, as if we‚Äôre all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it‚Äôs because their so mad at the other person‚Äôs opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn‚Äôt that mean you‚Äôve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I‚Äôm not an object. I definitely take it too far though, punching the wall, screaming, and destroying things are not normal emotions. To top that off, I am stuck in a constant eating disorder, starved until I couldn‚Äôt, ate until I exploded, I prefer the skinny side of me, I liked my body at least. Back to sadness‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt been able to explain it to anyone else what im feeling, to explain it on the deepest level I can, what I feel (maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic) is death, although I dont know what death feels like I assume its like getting old, or being on your death bed, my depression is like waiting to die, everyday not getting up to do anything, never being happy, not having anyone worry or miss you, that‚Äôs what death is overall. I seem normal on the outside, besides my arms (yes I mean that) but that‚Äôs only because if I cant even handle the beat down from myself, I dont know what‚Äôd I do if I had to endure hate from the outside world, that‚Äôs one of the scariest things in my opinion. Truly, if I could, I would cut all my hair off and fix it to my liking, I would tear my face off and stab it until I couldn‚Äôt anymore, and pay for a new one, I would melt my body until it could be transformed into something I could bare to look at, I would smush my brain until it could feel all emotions, in a normal way, until it could cure my mental illness(s), but I can‚Äôt do that, can I. It‚Äôs pretty disappointing that not even death wants to be friends with me, how do I know, from the multiple times I‚Äôve tried to meet them, they declined. Another thing I hate, is that I can‚Äôt be grateful for the things I have, I have a normal life don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have a nice house and good amount of money, but what‚Äôs so selfish and unfortunate is that I don‚Äôt want it, I don‚Äôt want this life, say, maybe one day I do get out of this comfort of sadness, happiness makes me uncomfortable, if I do get out of this one day, I‚Äôm still going to hate what I have, I hate what I have and what I don‚Äôt, that‚Äôs why its better off to end it all. One more thing I hope for in the future‚Ä¶ I want to be able to be alone by myself, and to love the people who love me. And most importantly, I want to learn how to not hate myself.",0

currently, he doesn‚Äôt answer my calls or text me. he is distant unless he thinks we can have sex. whenever i bring up that his control over every aspect of this relationship is making me miserable, he starts to threaten a complete break up again. when we do spend time together he basically leads me on. he tells me and he loves me and everything is going to be okay. we make future plans and i feel like everything is going to work out. but then he ghosts me all day. i have my own problems. i take care of his dog and cat. i have depression and anxiety and am currently struggling financially. i have no friends and my family doesn‚Äôt like me. everyday is a struggle. 

when he does talk to me on the phone, he always tells me things like he doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with me. he constantly tells me that he doesn‚Äôt like to be around me. he tells me that he doesn‚Äôt miss me and that he doesn‚Äôt want to see me. he knows i have struggled with suicidal thoughts, depression, and anxiety. he is always flipping between saying he loves me and saying he doesn‚Äôt want to be around me. he makes me feel like i‚Äôm not worth it. he makes me want to kill myself. out of everyone who doesn‚Äôt want to be around me or love me, i never thought he would become one of those people. i don‚Äôt say anything to make him say this stuff. he just feels the need to. i feel like it‚Äôs manipulative for me to tell him that the things he says and how he is treating me is making me suicidal. but i just want to make him stop

"I wish my friends would just let me go, why don't they hate me? They all tell me how much they care for me and deep down I know it's true.. But.. Why? I wish I could make myself believe it but I can't. Maybe they only care for me because of how much I always put on a facade. A face that screams ""I'm always happy and positive, I'm always goofing around and have no feelings!"" Whenever I am upset for ONE day they all joke and I joke too because that's what they expect of me to do. But it doesn't make it hurt any less. What if I suddenly don't treat it as a joke? Will they hate me, will they tell me I'm selfish? ""I'm sorry for being selfish, I'm sorry for acting like my feelings are more important than yours. I promise I'll try be a better friend and never act like this again."" It's true, I never wanna feel depressed around them because I don't want to be inconsiderate and if I have to put my feelings aside then I will, I don't wanna be selfish, I just need to vent just this once. :(",0

"Hi all. 

I have struggled with depression and anxiety from the age of 14, I‚Äôm 31 this month. 

I have worked since the age of 15 at various different jobs, I finally thought I‚Äôd found one now that was okay while I started to apply to study to go forward to apply for a probation officer program. 

My job is becoming stressful, a lot of pressure and I just can‚Äôt cope - I feel it‚Äôs impacting my mental health again, my anxiety is through the roof and I‚Äôm looking to apply for other jobs with less responsibility so I can do my job and head off home after not worrying sick. 

In the last 2/3 years there‚Äôs been jobs that have been terrible, I was bullied out of a job because I spoke up about the way things that weren‚Äôt right and it‚Äôs just destroyed any confidence I may have had. 

I can feel myself spiralling again into crisis like I was at the start of the year and I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore, it‚Äôs starting to develop into intense suicidal thoughts with serious intention again. 

I try so hard, I try my best and work as hard as I can and it just feels like it‚Äôs never good enough and it always goes wrong. I‚Äôm just so tired of it all now, not just how many times I can keep going through this cycle.  

The GP offers little support and CMHT refused to take me on or even assess me, so I‚Äôm at a loss of where to turn. My partner is very supportive but I don‚Äôt want to put too much on him either, as it‚Äôs not fair at all. ",0
"I can't go anywhere. I can't do anything. I'm broke. I'm stuck. I didn't ask for this. I don't want this. I didn't ask to be epileptic. I didn't ask to drop out and have to pay them $3k and never go back. I didn't ask to live on the edge of town so I could take 2 hours worth of busses every single day. I didn't ask for this. I didn't ask them to send me to therapy, then charge me $700 without telling me. I didn't ask my parents to divorce. I want to see my family but there's a $75 fee from Greyhound. I don't want to bother my friends because they've already heard enough, but I can't hold it in anymore. I'm fucking tired.

I asked for a job, and I finally got one, but it's not even enough. I'm scared to lose because I've already lost. Okay, let's get a new one! But you still have to take a $20 Uber if your bus is late. Alright, let's get a car instead! But you're gonna owe people money until the day you die. Alright, now let's get an apartment! But be careful! That's your whole salary for the month going down the drain!

My teenage goal in life was to be as independent and self-caring as my mother, but that goal has failed miserably. I still live with her and I'm in her way. How rich do I have to be to live in peace? What do I do?

"I think the way you are as a child sets the tone for the rest of your life no matter what you try because if you were depressed and had low self worth at age 8 no matter what you try the moment you let it go for a minute you will be back to being that kid 

It‚Äôs kind of like if you were a fat kid you can get ripped but you will always have low metabolism and always be at risk of going back to how u were if you stop trying ur best every day. It's hard coded inside and the moment the page refreshes ur back to square one. 

I try very hard. I try to be the best version of myself every day. But even now, when I am so far from being the kid I was back then, I still feel the same. None of my peers would guess I am as depressed as I am because you wouldn't think someone like me would be. Outwardly I try my best to be extroverted and confident to get away from the kid I used to be. But on the inside, Im just trying so so hard to pass as a normal person. Every night I think terrible things about myself and consider ending it. I know I won't do it because I have responsibilities but the thoughts are always there.

I wish I didn't have to try so hard. I wish this wasn't just my natural state of being. Idk if I should blame how my parents treated me or blame being an only child or blame my sexual/gender orientation or I don't fucking know. but its really true that even in kindergarten I never fit in and was always sadder than the other kids. I know I shouldn't feel sorry for myself and I know I shouldn't think this is just how I am but. it is how I am.  I just. wish I could just exist and didn't have to try so hard to not be unbearably sad all the time",0

I have thoughts of putting a gun to my head and ending it, but I am scared to. I have a slimmer of hope that things will get better, but that hope is also beaten out of me everyday.

"Even things like their rooms/apartments, general overall life situation, their success, looks (as in, they're able to look exactly like they want to look like. They don't have to constantly defend their choice of clothes)

I know social media is fake but even the real part that influences show (e.g. social media vs. Reality) is making me jealous. Idk if jealous is the right word, it's rather me feeling miserable if I'm thinking of myself.

I still don't have my life together. I've been struggling with mainly depression, ptsd and bpd for my whole teenage years, I've been struggling for almost 10 years straight.. and it's so hard to get back on track.

And then i see people who experienced similar things and them being successful and able to take care of themselves.. it just makes me feel really bad about myself. I wish. I still live at home which I really don't like. My family loves me and I love them but I feel so suffocated sometimes, by them and everything.

I see others succeeding while I'm kind of drowning in the crowd. Whenever I think that life can actually be good, I drop and go right back to sh and feeling miserable. I don't want to be like that.. but I don't know what to do. It feels like no matter what I do, in the end it doesn't matter, since I'll always fall back.

""Dont think so negative, obviously it doesn't work then"", I know that. Why would I not know that. It's easier for someone who hasn't been struggling with mental illness, especially for almost half their life.. sigh. I don't wanna stress negativity but it's just really bothering me currently. :/

I especially compare myself to my cousin. He hasn't had these issues. He's only 17 and he is much more responsible, he does his chores, he studies, he's very smart and he has the same interests my grandma for example has. They never say it but I cant help feeling like people prefer him. I feel like im just way too much work and effort for people and I don't want to be remembered as that. I feel like I ruin everyone that lives with me, gets close with me or tries to help me. This makes me want to disappear so bad. I don't know what to do anymore.

Part of it was also because I had stopped percs a month ago and was craving anything shaped like a pill.

Hello everyone I hope you're feeling better than I am right now


I've always known that I wouldn't have the same experiences as peers my age because I have older parents, they were 39(mom) and 58/9(dad) respectively when they had me 


I love my parents so much but I knew early on that I'll probably say goodbye sooner than my peers with their parents, whilst I pray to my Allah that I'll have more time with them, I can't help ny feelings about death 


My father died a couple years ago and even though I knew it was coming for years due to his age and illnesses it absolutely broke me, I was broken and probably am still broken from his death, I experienced grief later on because whilst I cried and mourned for weeks after his death it was around 2 months after where it really hit me that he died, I changed and was feeling suicidal for a long time but I couldn't do anything because I knew my mother was still here and I have to be strong for her 


Now I am still praying my mother lives for a long long time, I can't help but be scared and anxious for her leaving me, she has her own health problems and I am scared and petrified of what ifs, I can't lose another parent especially not my mother


I know I probably have Anticipatory Grief, I've had it since I was a child, it damaged my thinking now as an adult because I formed a fear of missing a call or getting called at night thinking it is bad news, back when I was a child whenever I get a phone call at night I was scared that it was because of my father passing, and he really did pass at night, I got call from his caretaker that he passed in the hospital, I was about to visit him in the morning and he passed, I couldn't even see him before he was buried due to circumstances


I am still scared that one day my mother will also leave me and I don't know if I can live on without her

"This is gonna be a long post and it‚Äôs probably not gonna be well written so bear with me. Reddit is the only non biased place I can vent and seek advice at the same time. 

I am an angry person. I hate everyone and everything. I have no idea why.

My childhood was good I guess. I feel like my parents did a good job raising me. I wasn‚Äôt spoiled but I did have more opportunities than my peers. I am an only child. So I can‚Äôt think of any childhood trauma that would cause my anger issues. The only thing that maybe would have anything to do with it is when I was in high school I was the kid everyone picked on but tbh it didn‚Äôt really bother me because I didn‚Äôt like anyone anyways lol

I didn‚Äôt start noticing how much of a hostile person I am until I reached adulthood. At 19 I bought my first home, had a good job, good friend group, etc. I did develop an alcohol problem but got it under control after my DUI when I was 24. I still drink occasionally but only when I‚Äôm home. There is no correlation between my anger and alcohol. Just wanted to add that for context on my life. I have the smallest fuse. If someone looks at me the wrong way I‚Äôm ready to kill them. I can‚Äôt count on my fingers and toes the amount of times I‚Äôve plotted someone‚Äôs death in my head. 

I‚Äôm now 29 and it‚Äôs like the anger is full force. I‚Äôm happily engaged to the love of my life and he is literally the best person in the world. He‚Äôs very patient and understanding and non judge mental. What‚Äôs crazy is I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve gotten more angry in the last 3 years we‚Äôve been together. But it has nothing to do with him or anything he‚Äôs done. He has a great career as do I so financials aren‚Äôt an issue. I used to be an extrovert now I can‚Äôt stand to leave the house. I can‚Äôt stand to be around people because people are fucking stupid. If someone says something stupid it will send me into a rage. If someone is loud/obnoxious I imagine hurting them. I love the thought of beating the shit out of someone who messes with me.

Here‚Äôs where it turns into depression. I will get so mad about something so minute and after I blackout from shear anger I beat myself up because once I calm down I‚Äôm embarrassed for myself at how mad I get. I do have a history of suicidal thoughts and 1 attempt (during my alcohol abuse). Generally when I do get angry it doesn‚Äôt turn physical. I don‚Äôt put my hands on people. It pretty much gets compartmentalized. 

My biggest problem is I don‚Äôt have any non religious connections that I can properly seek help from. 

I got extremely angry tonight. I had one of the most violent outbursts I‚Äôve had in a while. It started with my DoorDash order. It was wrong. I got pissed. Then I was playing a video game. Game lagged out and I lost all my progress. Rage quit. Decided to go take a shower because I figured that would make me feel better. Went to wash my hair and I was out of conditioner. I then threw all the bottles out of the shower. My fianc√© has a little mirror in the shower and I almost punched it when I saw my reflection. 

I‚Äôm to the point where I hate myself. I can‚Äôt lose weight because of my hormones I‚Äôm on from a hysterectomy in 2019. I‚Äôm not an obese person just slightly overweight. My sleep is being affected because of my anger turns depression. I‚Äôm too afraid to take sleeping meds because I already don‚Äôt hear my alarm clock in the mornings. I‚Äôm constantly stressed or mad about something. Those suicidal thoughts are coming back and it scares tf out of me. 

Now I‚Äôm mad I can‚Äôt fix me.

"I'm too sensitive to it. I make a small joke like putting on those eclipse glasses and looking at my friend and saying ""I can't see you, you must not be very bright"". At the time I thought it was really funny, but I told somebody else that joke today and they didn't laugh. I asked my friend if she had thought it was funny and she said she did now, but that it had hurt her feelings a little in the moment. Learning that made me feel terrible. 

The other day I told my boss he looked weird in his shirt. I meant to say seeing him in a certain casual shirt was weird cause I'm so used to seeing him dressed as a boss. I felt bad and had to track him down later to apologize and he said he had actually thought it was funny and that he felt bad that I felt the need to apologize. Which made me feel worse like I'd made a situation that wasn't awkward into one that was. 

But the big giant thing is I just ended things with someone I really, really care about and deeply love. This man is really just the best. We were friends first. He's kind, he's loyal, he's funny, he's so generous, and I wanted our relationship to work but I just wasn't feeling it for whatever reason. I ended things as quickly as I realized, and he is taking it really hard. He's a beautiful soul and I never would want to hurt him and now I doubt he'll ever want to be my friend again. 

I just feel like I keep hurting peoples feelings, or if I didn't, I think myself into circles until I convince myself that I did. Or sometimes I REALLY hurt people. I killed a fly the other day and cried about it, because what right did I have to take it's life? But other people don't get so affected in this way. It's exhausting, I don't want to hurt anyone. Honestly. It genuinely makes me wish I was never born. I would so much rather be broken up with than be the person doing the breaking up, because at least in that instance I'm not carrying all this guilt. 

I was thinking of ending my life today and what I would write on the note. ""I don't want to hurt anyone anymore."" But how silly would that be? Because by taking my life, I would be hurting people who love me. And I know there are a few who do, I have a pretty good support system. I just am so tired. I'm so tired of being hurt and of hurting and I have been through a lot in my life and I just don't really want to do it anymore, honestly. But there's no out, I just have to go through it all. I don't mean to sound whiney but god I just really don't want to go through it all.  

I am trying to look at my life as something to cherish. I remember my 7th grade teacher used to congratulate us on our birthdays instead of saying happy birthday, and we all thought it was weird, but sometime near the end of the school year, when someone finally questioned her, she told us ""not everyone makes it to 13. Lots of people don't. You've made it this far, so congratulations!"" And I try to remember that. I'm 26 now (I probably sound a lot younger, sorry you had to read all my whining) and I can picture myself living a whole life, but on top of all the hurt and guilt I feel, there's a lot of anxiety about the state of the world and I don't even know what the future can look like. So is this life even something to cherish? Lately I feel like it's all something to fear, or something of a burden, and I am getting tired of carrying it.",0

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm a 17M, and recently my parents got divorced and now my dad moved to another country and got remarried within months. Now every time I call him, if I ask for money for anything (cuz I barely make a couple hundred dollars a month at my part time job in high school), he gets upset and acts like I‚Äôm asking him a huge favor. Now I feel stressed out trying to cover all my own expenses other than rent, which my mom pays. I‚Äôm now living in a 2 bedroom apartment with my mom and my sister, and sleep on the couch every night. I‚Äôm getting stressed the hell out on expenses to how I‚Äôm gonna pay for college. It‚Äôs annoying to look at all my friends living a comfortable life while I‚Äôm out here trying to help with basic expenses.

"Hello. I'm 31 years old male from Puerto Rico, and still living with my mother. I wish this wasn't the case, but I don't have any money to buy my own house. I'm also obese at 5'8"" 280 pounds. At times I try to do exercise, but I find it extremely difficult and don't last long. Also, I tell myself that I'm going to start lifting weights, but I have zero motivation and have a hard time concentrating. I always feel like hot garbage, zero energy, sloppy. I've had some ancestors that had cancer, could it be a hereditary disease or something? I've lived a very sedentary life for 11 years.

I feel helpless, I can't sleep at night. I live in a house where they have a car repair shop. I'm willing to work there but constantly find myself distracted and don't do anything.

I wish I had a job that paid me the minimum wage at least, but I live in a somewhat rural area, lots of houses but not many commercial buildings. Everything is 30 minutes away and I don't have a car. I could use some money right now.

What can I do to improve my life? Are there any supplements out there that help with well-being? Maybe I have some type of deficiency that makes me feel like I'm depressed. Perhaps a chemical unbalance in the brain? When I try to sleep at night, I feel like someone is performing an exorcism on me and feel awful.

I know there are supplements out there that could help me, but I have no idea which. I ingest anti-depressants like Ativan, Restoril and Zyprexa. The only thing they do is aid with sleep somewhat.

There are lots of things I want, like a gaming computer and perhaps find a girlfriend, but women like men who are in shape and take care of themselves. I have a hard time brushing my teeth.

I'm convinced there's something wrong with me, but I don't know what it is. My school experience was terrible, I was bullied from middle school, then my parents got divorced right before I entered high school and moved 2 hours away. The last few years of school didn't get much better.

I want to live, be happy and feel good. I'd love to travel a little perhaps, although I'm not a huge fan of traveling, but most importantly, I want to achieve independence.

My dream is to play iRacing. I've always been big on video games, and always aspired to have iRacing since it was released, almost two decades ago. I find it hard to believe that I haven't yet played that game. I'm super scared to talk to people with fears that they're going to make fun of me.

What is wrong with me? I always tell myself, if others can do something, I can do it too.

When I was in high school, I fantasized about being a trans, started doing stupid things with my food, like overeating white rice so my glutes would get bigger. I also made my testicles drop so I could produce more estrogens to look like a woman. Could it be hormonal imbalance? My fapping doesn't feel good at all like it did in high school. I have man boobs as well and my orgasms are super weak. I think I have erectile dysfunction. I am uncircumcised. 

I almost had intercourse with a man in his 60's when I was in high school. Entered his house at least 10 times with intentions of doing it, but never actually did anything. Perhaps that scene gave me some mental trauma? He did touch me a few times, but I was scared and just left the house. I also gave my stepbrother head once when I was 15. Maybe I have a disease or something.

My father was pretty abusive when I was younger, I've always been told to respect older peers, he would sometimes hit me with belts when I did something bad in school. It was super scary; I was always scared of him.

I don't want to get in trouble, I just want to get to the bottom of my issue, assuming there is one. I just want to be happy. I really need to get in shape first if I want to find a woman willing to be with me.

I smoked weed in high school and had a panic attack. My memory of that situation is not very good. I'm not sure if I did something to trigger the panic attack. I may have started doing circles, which made me dizzy, but I'm not sure.

Any supplements or pills out there that could help my well-being? Multivitamins are not doing the trick.

I also experienced jock itch, which I thought was candida albicans. This jock itch thing lasted for more than a decade from 2011 to 2022. It has been gone for almost two years now, but I still may have something down there.

Spanish is my first language. I have family members in California that have decent income, but they don't want me there or even help me at all. My father lives there and I wish I could move with him but it's not his house.

I share all of these things with you to see if we can get to the bottom of my issues. Maybe it's medical or something insignificant or easy to fix, I don't know.",0
"It's like I'm either totally wired in to what I'm doing, or I've checked out and don't know my own name.

Recently I've been wanting to play games with my friends but I just can't do anything besides sleep and work. Even if I sleep I'm so exhausted that I feel sick. Quite often my brain feels like it's on a race track, just endless thoughts spinning around. Other times it's quite and hollow like a cave. I'm pretty sure if someone knocked on my head they could gear the echo.

My mind is burning. It feels like I'm doing nothing right, nothing at all. Every thought I have spins around untill it's awful. I argue with myself outloud and it's always me telling myself to kill myself, then I reply for God knows what reason. Back and forth never conceding. Death is always on my mind, suicide is the thought right behind that.

I don't see any point in living for myself anymore. Or the point in living at all. My body hurts. My mind burns. I'm hungry. Think I'll fry my last egg in twelve hours. ",0
"I have been hurting for a long time, and I have the scars to prove it. I‚Äôve never had the sense that I was enough for anyone. In the last 2 years, I‚Äôve undergone serious surgery, my dog and my best friend have died, and my parents are up my ass about school and my life goals. 
I‚Äôm a college student at a very prestigious university; however, recently my grades have dropped significantly. This all started after I was raped. I called my best friend that night, and she immediately came to get me. I was at a party, got too drunk, and someone took advantage of that. About 6 months later, I was rushed to the hospital as I was dying from organ failure. I was stuck in the hospital for a significant amount of time, which meant I was missing school. My parents blamed me, and told me I should watch my health in the future to avoid missing school. The next semester my best friend died, so I took about a week off of school. I took this time off because I couldn‚Äôt sleep, eat, or function as a person during this time. My parents once again blamed me, and said I should just ‚Äúman up‚Äù and get through the rest of the semester. 
The past 6 months have been filled with self-loathing and anger because of everything life has done to me. I have failed out of many of my classes, which has caused me to fall behind. I now have to take a ridiculous course load over the summer to make up for my performance over the last two semesters. Sometimes, I just feel like not being here anymore is the easiest solution. Who would care anymore because my best friend is already dead. I just can‚Äôt take the awful things that have been thrown my way anymore, and I have no way of dealing with them. My parents don‚Äôt believe in mental health and I have no way of paying for therapy. 
Additionally, I feel like I lose a little chunk of myself every day. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm the genuine and kind person I once was and that makes me so sad. I don‚Äôt know how to deal with any of this anymore, and I‚Äôm scared one day I‚Äôll have had enough.",0
"A little over a week ago, I made an attempt. I won't say how, because it should have been effective and I really don't want to give anyone ideas. It's left me in a pretty fucked up state. I'll probably never walk again...

Please, to anybody who might be considering this... don't.  If you aren't successful, you could end up in a much worse position than you are already in. And if you are successful, the pain of losing another is... unbearable. At least that is what I have been told when I coded, and my time of death was announced... only for me to revive miraculously. 

Now, not only have I lost EVERYTHING in my life that is material, the majority of my loved ones do not ever wish to speak to me again and I can not move my legs... can't say that I blame them. Royally fucked up this time. 

Just... please. Don't do it. It's never worth it.",0
"Lost another friend, i blame my stupid emotions. I shouldn‚Äôt have even been upset to begin with but something in me just felt off for the last 48 hours. It‚Äôs hitting me that I‚Äôm completely alone. I hate it, i hate having abandonment issues. Normal people can be fine alone but I‚Äôm not normal I guess. I hope I die in a crash tomorrow on my way to work ",0
Ive always heard to try writing down my feelings instead of bottling them up all the time. I hope I can benefit from my writing down these thoughts somehow in the future. I wrote this on a little whiteboard and took a picture of it but I can‚Äôt attach the screenshot so here‚Äôs the text - ‚Äúim a pathetic and sad individual who doesn‚Äôt exist or matter. it won‚Äôt matter in the end. i can‚Äôt start or accomplish anything. i am unattractive and nobody likes me. please don‚Äôt perceive me. i have no willpower. i have no goals or aspirations. i have no hobbies. i have no energy. i don‚Äôt want to die.‚Äù,0
"I 20m have been wondering how i can get some antidepressants. I know people have to go to a doctor and get it prescribed. But I was wondering. If I have to go to a doctor or I can do it online. Or is there a way to make sure to get them. I‚Äôve been having thoughts on ending it and I thought I should give medical drugs a try. I‚Äôve smoked pot to deal with it but I can‚Äôt no more.

So I want to ask how do I do it specifically. Do I have to go to a clinic and if I do will I have to go again or will I get sent to a therapist or psychiatrist. If I do how do I pay for it. How would it works. I wish to keep it hidden from my parent at all cost. I know they would probably support me at going. But I physically cannot ask them for help. Is there a possibility to do it or is there no way to do it. 

Any info would be helpful. Of this is the wrong subreddit pls let me. Know I don‚Äôt use Reddit a lot. ",0
"tired as fuck, dont really see much working out for me and i've either lost passion or am starting to lose passion in everything i do. everything's going to shit anyway both for me and probably the world in general

with my dumbass i'm probably gonna amount to nothing, i dont wanna do anything with my life anyway especially when im terrible with everything i do

i dont really care about shit, already planning on dying at least maybe a decade from now. why a decade? well mostly two things, to be alone and to be able to get a gun. debating as to whether it should be a revolver, pistol or maybe shotgun. i dunno

"Llevo a√±os en este estado ,en d√≥nde siento que no hago m√°s que postergar el dolor , que vivir de efectos placebos que hacen que pueda digerir de alguna manera la vida. Me muestro tan fuerte y fr√≠a,pero por dentro soy tan sensible y me afecta mucho lo de mi alrededor.

Siento que me estoy perdiendo nuevamente, siento que estoy apagandome cada vez m√°s.Lamento tanto no poder mejorar , siento que hay algo mal conmigo, que siempre llego a esta instancia, en d√≥nde no puedo amar bien, no puedo ser una buena hija, nieta, hermana o novia.Finalmente siempre hago da√±o, indirectamente, siempre lo arruino.",0

"Probably nothing surprising here, but I really just need to have my thoughts out. If I end up killing myself soon, it may give some insight so it‚Äôs not just the ‚Äúno one could have predicted this‚Äù BS. Everything is a mess. People keep asking me for updates on aspects of my life and I just have to lie and say things are fine. But they‚Äôre not. I have no fucking clue what‚Äôs going on. I‚Äôm behind on everything but I don‚Äôt have the energy to fix it. I‚Äôm just so tired all the time. I get enough sleep, but I‚Äôm still so exhausted constantly. I don‚Äôt have the energy to do the daily tasks most people seem to be capable of. I‚Äôve gone to doctors and they say I‚Äôm healthy. But if I‚Äôm healthy, then why do I have to lie on the bakery floor partway through my shifts otherwise I‚Äôll pass out? Thoughts of killing myself are happening more intensely now. Where as before I would just passively think about suicide, it‚Äôs now at the forefront of my mind and I‚Äôm this close to just doing it. I‚Äôm with my family stuck in a gas station parking lot for the night in the middle of nowhere right now. And I really want to just walk off into the desert. I don‚Äôt want anyone to find me. I don‚Äôt want them to have a funeral for me. I don‚Äôt want them looking at me and crying thinking what they could have done better like they did at my cousins funeral a few months ago. I just want to  be gone. Like I never existed. Since I can‚Äôt seem to do anything right. I used to be a straight A student, and now I‚Äôm failing all my classes because I can‚Äôt function like a normal human. My friends see me as the person they can turn to when they need help. The person who remembers birthdays. The person who will make them a home cooked meal. The person who will help them with homework. But they forget my birthday. They offer support, but never any actual support. I ask for help, and they forget‚Ä¶ my partner is such a kind person but I just don‚Äôt love them anymore. And the thought of breaking their heart just makes my anxiety over life so much worse. 
There‚Äôs so much more but it‚Äôs probably nothing new here. 
I don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm just sick of life like this. I think about the best case scenario and I just realize that life doesn‚Äôt have any meaning. There isn‚Äôt any point to continue existing. I just need to find a way to exit in a way where people won‚Äôt find or mourn me. ",0
Im so lost its insane. What am I supposed to believe in anymore? I don't know if I believe in God or the big bang theory. Nobody knows how this universe was created. People in religions think that their God created the universe but you don't have any proof? YOU believe that a God exists. I want to believe in God but why does God allow all this evil to happen? If God is an infinite being why couldn't he have just made the world good and not have any evil? ,0
"My mom (54) is severely depressed. All she does is sit in one corner of the bedroom with mess around her (she has hoarding tendencies) and stares at the wall, sometimes she goes into a sort of meditative state and after that she gets up crying. This happens very often even in public.
There is nothing we can say to her that'll make her feel better. She does not want to get out of the house but always complains about the house closing in on her. She always has a pain in her chest and has trouble breathing, she has also complains that she doesn't recognise herself anymore. She doesn't pick up any calls by her friends and family.

How can we help her? It has been three years of this behaviour on and off, she has not genuinely laughed in past three years. Please help us we are desperate.

We are well to do family, with servants to help us, no current crisis as such that would make her depressed, maybe her dwelling in the past is the reason.",0
"I have always denoncouned any labels to myself. Personally I find it limiting 
Yet sometimes calling something for what it is doesn‚Äôt help identity it.

Recently watched the Bridgerton queen series with my partner 
And this triggered me to acknowledging that I go through episodes of such lows and such highs.

As a young boy, I was such an over thinker. Alone most of my life, found comfort in myself and lived a lot in my own head.
Fast forward to being in my twenty‚Äôs
To combat that way of life, I simply didn‚Äôt think about what I was doing.
I just did it, with no thought of reprocussion.
This lead me into a dark path

Over the last 3 years I have found ways to get out of that way of life.
I mediate, write, gym, pray.

Yet living more open to feelings and what courses through me can sometimes undermine me.

There‚Äôs always this underlying sense of‚Ä¶emptiness and sadness.

I know if I think too much now that really, it hurts me.

How do others go about this?

To live and enjoy, to consciously embrace and reflect yet engage in life in a matter of ‚Äúdoing‚Äù?
To avoid this dread that lingers me.

"I have no skills. I didn‚Äôt go to school. I‚Äôve been unemployed for two months and struggling to find a job because everything is so hard for me and I can‚Äôt do anything right.

I have friends but no one I‚Äôm really that close with or feel comfortable enough to talk to.

All I want is for someone to love me. I was never protected, not even as a child and I hold so much resentment towards my mother for it. My dad‚Äôs dead. I have two older sisters but they don‚Äôt bother trying. I got dumped six months ago by the only person who noticed how broken I was and he made me feel so safe and cared for, but he is way too good for me and I don‚Äôt blame him for leaving.

I never complain. I‚Äôm nice to everyone, I don‚Äôt have a bad thing to say about anyone, and I do everything I can to support the people I care about but it‚Äôs never enough. 
I have no interests. I feel so dull and boring and I have nothing going on in my head. I have such a hard time finding things to talk about. 
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a bad person but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm a good person either.
I spend all day alone and my mom doesn‚Äôt even check in on me. No one ever asks me how I am.

I started self harming again this year, the only person who‚Äôs seen my scars was a guy I was seeing  for a couple of months and I thought he cared.
I‚Äôve starved myself to the point where I‚Äôm at least ten pounds underweight, I weigh as much as I did when I was 12 and no one notices, or if they do they just don‚Äôt care. 
I‚Äôm afraid of letting anyone else in because I‚Äôm so ashamed of myself and I can‚Äôt deal with being abandoned again but I want nothing more than to be close with someone. I will never be good enough.
I just want to be loved. I want someone to notice I‚Äôm not okay. I need someone to take care of me.

"I don't know where to turn. I'm so damn lost and need help.. I think I may be clinically insane. I don't know. I have real bad anxiety and PTSD as well as depression and I am extremely sensitive. This whole thing is getting to the point that I might eventually unalive myself. It sucks when even your family doesn't want you around because of it. They feel like they are stuck with me. I'm being cut off because of this and only people who seem to care are my friends. I've had a rough childhood and what makes matters worse is the fact that my family was the cause of it and now they want to throw me away. 

When I was two I had to step on glass just to get their attention to see if they loved me. 

When I was expelled from middle for making a threat for being bullied I was punished and for almost a year. Anything I said or did lead to more punishment.

My grandmother tried pushing me down the stairs calling me an ungrateful child. 

My mother has called me a burden and wished I was never born. 

When my step father hit me in the face she was mad at ME. 

I tried to kill myself when I was 17. Instead of my mom trying to figure out what was wrong she yelled at me. 

I've been suffering for so long and my family KNEW something was wrong with me. Instead of being proactive they just let it fester and now that it has gotten this bad they refuse to deal with me. 

What hurts is that NONE of them will tell me the truth. Even when I ask. They will tell me I'm over thinking only to literally talk shit about me for HOURS on in about how crazy I am about how sick I am. Forget all the bad shit they have ever done to me right. How do you cope when everyone you love hates you. How am I supposed to handle this.

"so i don't really think i'm depressed. it's just like sadness bruh. 

i understand that this isn't like doctors diagnosis or anything, this is reddit for goodness sakes. i just wanna hear like public opinion 

so couple things:
a. i lost passion in things i used to love (reason being i'm not good enough)
b. too lazy/no motivation or drive to even try to get good at the things i say i'm not good enough at

1. i hate my friends all of a sudden. (Not all of a sudden it's been a gradual climb. it's just like all their little quirks just set me off. i can't handle their entire personality) 
i have been friends with them for a while so maybe i just grew out of them? 
2. i kinda am disliking my family. not my family, just my siblings. (i'm the youngest and all my siblings are highly accomplished so i have a big gap to fill in. i feel like i have no personality and only my older siblings exist. i just hate how i'm constantly compared to my siblings and have nothing that they can compare to. I DONT HATE MY SIBLINGS. i hate that i get compared to them)
maybe all normal siblings hate each other? also maybe it's an inferiority complex thing idk. 
3. i really just hate myself for being all these things. (I feel like i have no true reason to hate any of my friends or siblings. they all are great people but for some reason i can't handle them. I just don't understand why i hate them so violently. it just makes me feel like a disgusting shitty horrible person.)
is this depression or just like me being an unreasonably bad dude?

One time she hit cause i jumped over the couch cause I didnt want to get infront of the tv to intercut her show and she got a belt and whooped me for 2 minutes, my sister came to me after when i was crying and called my mom to pick us up. I dont go to visit often since then and have never stayed for more than a week since. Most of the time my brother would hit me i wouldnt tell my mom since nth would happen and he would just b mad. It didnt stop until i had the intention to kill him and tried stabbing him which he beat me down and told my mom and he stopped after.

 I tried talking to my mom about it but she just says its normal brother stuff and how her younger brother would fight with her, its not the same at all. They dont know whats it like to be that little and skinny and the way it hurts and crying cause all you wanted was to have fun but they wanted to punish me. She said im just supposed to move past it but those people arent my family, ive never felt loved by them only tolerated. I dont like them at all and they just think im a pussy. I dont think im overreacting, this isnt normal right. All my mom has to say is she tried her best as a single mother and thats it and she‚Äôs sorry i feel this way. It wasnt just the hitting, the verbal abuse of being reminded how ugly i was made really insecure about myself, i didnt do well in school and would get called things but it would always be ‚Äújokes‚Äù. Kids would laugh and say things about my skin, then id have to go home and hear the same thing. Im moreno and my family would just say things just reinforcing how lesser than human I really am. The german word is untermensch, thats what i am in their subconscious, thats what i appear as to everyone 

I think about killing myself alot and cry sometimes and my mom came in my room asking what was wrong in december, i told her to leave me alone and she wouldn‚Äôt get out so I pushed her out, not hard just pushed i made sure not to press her hard. My brother came in the room saying if i ever put my hands on her again he‚Äôd fuck me up. He still thinks about doing it, it made me want to end my life more and the only reason i havent done it is cause i dont have a gun, i dont know what to do. I have a 3.95 gpa since i try to do my work right at school since their isnt anything else to do. I dont think i like these people, i dont think whatever they do for me I can just move past it. I dont like these people and i have to vent on reddit since im not close to anyone and dont talk to anyone daily, its just me and my now ps5 thanks to my stepdad. I dont think i mind it but i feel alone, i feel like no matter what i do it doesnt matter. Why would people who love me do this to me",0
"My psychiatrist told me I was probably born depressed, meaning I have the tendency to feel this way and it‚Äôs true that i‚Äôve been feeling depressed for most of my life. I remember when I was 9 or 10, I was watching TV during christmas time and all of a sudden I felt like nothing matters. Like whats the point?
Anyway, I was put on a bunch of different meds 3 years ago which didn‚Äôt help much since i‚Äôve attempted suicide 3 times since that. 
So my question is, once again, what‚Äôs the point? Im 25 and ever since I‚Äôve been conscious I‚Äôve been depressed. I feel terrible unless something really good happens, but even that doesn‚Äôt last for long. Please tell me if anyone else feels the same and what I should do. Today was one of the worst days in a long time and I‚Äôm convinced I should kill myself, even though I‚Äôm very aware of all the things i‚Äôm going to miss and of all the people i am going to hurt.",0

" Crazy-? 

 I‚Äôve been an outcast my entire life. In my family, with friends, school, anywhere I go it feels like I‚Äôm pinned against a wall. They look at me as if I‚Äôm not human- my mom said she could tell someone I‚Äôm special needs and they wouldn‚Äôt question it, she has to understand that‚Äôs hurtful right?

Growing up I was outgoing and loud, in my family I was categorized with my cousin, we were ‚Äúthe weird kids‚Äù, my cousins would make fun of him when he wasn‚Äôt around and I know they did the same with me. They have called me childish for as long as I can remember, but obviously I was childish I was a fucking child. As I grew up I got quieter, anxious and terrified of disappointing people. I had some not so great relationships and friendships that made me feel crazy. I was 12 when these things started happening, dated someone that was not good for me to say the least. Started hurting myself in 7th grade because of them, broke up after almost  5 months and I spent the next 2 years yearning for their attention, for them to love me the way I loved them. They used me to take out all there anger, they were so nice when we met, an amazing friend but as soon as we dated they became hurtful and cold. Treated everyone around me kindly and me like total shit. A couple months after we broke up I got close to him, a person I can‚Äôt bare to see. He laughs and makes gag noises when he sees me as if I was the problem- he lied to me through our entire relationship, made up people and story‚Äôs. Told me that he had certain things in his closet, hurtful things- said his dad hit him and even made up 3 fake friends to trick me into things. I knew he was lying I‚Äôm not an idiot but I ‚Äúloved‚Äù him. We were on and off for months and I honestly can‚Äôt remember all the horrible things he made me do because they are so far repressed into my mind. I remember one night in particular tho, I wish I could forget it- I was at his house and we were hanging out having a good time, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and told me he wanted to ‚Äútry something‚Äù he gave me the knife and took off his shorts and told me to cut him. he said that he was into it and when I said I didn‚Äôt want to he said I didn‚Äôt love him. He claimed I had been lying to him and if i loved him id do it, so I took the knife and did what he said-  to make it even worse this little girl from across the street was there, he had her sit in the closet before it happened. she was 9, a fucking 9 year old. he's the one that made my self harm even worse, he made me start vaping, drinking, made me do things- he used to claim that he couldn't kiss me because of his braces which obviously I knew was a lie but I was to scared to ask him why he really wouldn't kiss me- ofc now i know its because he never actually loved me. one of the last nights i was at his house was the worst tho, he had made me do so many things before that night and i knew what was next. I had never had sex with anyone before, people talk about how there first time was special or amazing but mine was horrible- so horrible i barley remember it, he didn't want to touch me he only wanted me to touch him as he had the entire relationship. I didn't want to but I did because I thought he'd fall in love with me somehow. after that night we broke up completely and haven't talked since. No one knows about the things that happened with him, no one cares- we only broke up because the first abusive partner texted me, they said they loved me and wanted to be with me so I ended it with him. A week or two later they decided they hated me again, them along with my other ‚Äúfriend‚Äù texted me they hated me that new years along with a lot of other messages about how horrible I was, and both blocked me. A month later the other friend reached out and we began talking again, then my ex also reach out and everything was ‚Äúfine‚Äù I started dating this person during that time, they were sweet but also not and our relationship didn‚Äôt last long because that February my ex texted me again. They came over and we had a night that we called ‚Äúlong hug night‚Äù we sat in my room and hugged for hours not saying anything, we were high and crying and we felt close. They said they wanted to kiss me but since I was dating someone I told them it couldn‚Äôt happen. A week later on April fools night I broke up with my boyfriend to be with them and a week after that they got cold again- we stopped talking after I yelled at them for doing that again and a month later I found out they were dating my friend. During all of this the ex-friend that joined my ex in hating on me for new years had gotten rather close to me, I found out they liked me and one Wednesday at a friends house we kissed. The next week he came over and we had a great time, at one point we kissed again and made out which from my knowledge was completely ok because he didn‚Äôt tell me he didn‚Äôt want to and we had kissed the week before. 3 days later I found out he told a bunch of our friends that I sexually assaulted him. Everyone was against me and I lost almost all of my friends over a lie- I have been SA and I would never do that to someone else. Back to the girl and my ex though, I only found out they were together because they broke up and after they did I felt bad for my friend and asked if she wanted to see a movie with me to cheer her up, we got close and started dating and I bet you know we‚Äôre this leads. She claimed to be a ‚Äúlesbian‚Äù but since I am trans and identify as a male she wasn‚Äôt one, she got mad at me for mentioning top surgery and continued to say she was lesbian while dating a trans man. After a bit I lost connection because of this and I broke up with her and 2 months later on October 1st to 6th my sister got in a car accident and died. She was 16, and I was 14. I couldn‚Äôt believe it- ofc during this that ex-friend that cost me nearly all of my friends showed up again, he apologized for the things he said and told people and wanted to be friends again. Since we had mutual friends we got closer and I thought it was behind us until he got cold months later and screamed at me. During the October my sister died I got close to this girl, scarlet, she was kind and sweet and she dressed up as Garfield for Halloween. That December we kissed while watching tinkerbell and started dating January 15th 2023. I have nothing bad to say about her because it‚Äôs currently july 14th 2024 and our year and a half is tomorrow. I love her more than worlds can describe. 

But even with the girl I want to marry someday I still feel crazy. I hate myself more than I thought possible and everyday is weighing on me. Although to everyone else around me it looks like nothings happening I‚Äôm crumbling. Struggling to wake up each morning and not scream at myself. I have diagnosed ADHD and anxiety along with so many other issues that are tearing me apart. My girlfriend thinks I have an eating disorder, people I‚Äôve talk to think I have autism or am bipolar, and everyone else thinks I‚Äôm crazy. I‚Äôm 16 man- I‚Äôm just a kid. All I can think about is how badly I hate everything I do. I have no dreams, no future plans, no hope. I‚Äôm terrified of driving, I don‚Äôt have a job, I have nothing. It feels like everyone hates me, and if they don‚Äôt now they will. I can‚Äôt stop hurting myself or getting high or eating to much or starving myself. I know change starts with me and no one else can fix this but I don‚Äôt know how to. I‚Äôm a fat, ugly, tranny that my parents don‚Äôt even want. They want their little girl but she died a long time ago and if they‚Äôre not careful they‚Äôll lose their boy too. I‚Äôm this close to ending it all, I can‚Äôt keep living like this. I‚Äôm tired of carrying this burden, I‚Äôm tired of being such a burden to people that I love. I can‚Äôt stop being terrible, it feels like that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever been. Like I deserve everything that‚Äôs happened to me- I‚Äôm suicidal, homicidal, and I need real help that I can‚Äôt get. I wish for something horrible to happen to me because just maybe they‚Äôll care and realize I wasn‚Äôt fucking playing around. I‚Äôm serious and I‚Äôve always been serious- maybe I am crazy  ",0
"I went to inpatient in 2022 and have been suffering still. I‚Äôve gone to therapy, have taken meds and got back on track to have a more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life with a job and stuff. I‚Äôve gained a few friends as well. But on the inside I‚Äôm absolutely rotting. Nothing seems to be giving me that extra lift to actually feel normal. 

Inpatient didn‚Äôt help long term but it stopped me from killing myself. I‚Äôm hesitant, firstly because my suicidal thoughts come in waves, and secondly because I have narcissistic parents who would be absolutely livid if I went back. My health insurance wouldn‚Äôt cover the cost and I‚Äôd likely be left with thousands of dollars of debt. If anyone knows of any other options please tell me.",0

Reading your guys posts and seeing the different problems you guys are dealing with really makes me think about my own life for me my life sucks I screwed it up bad because I was a lazy kid I guess and just a mess of a person in general I really haven‚Äôt changed at all still so don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm talking in the past tense but I‚Äôm not riddled with terrible emotions like I have really bad social anxiety and I‚Äôm incredibly ashamed of my life and who I am but I generally enjoy things I laugh a good bit I cry often as well thinking about the lack of future I have but that‚Äôs just the thing I wish I had a future I want to have a life find love have friends but I feel like I‚Äôve been an idiot and screwed my self over and will never get any of those things but many of you have life‚Äôs friends significant others and your constantly plagued with bad emotions and well put simply depression at first I genuinely didn‚Äôt believe a lot of you I thought at least you have a life your not going to end up homeless how could you be that depressed but it seems that that situation is the majority on here and honestly seems worse like what do you even do to fix that it‚Äôs not that there‚Äôs a specific problem in life your cursing your just depressed I‚Äôm just wondering what you guys think of this and also what do you think causes this feel for you guys ,0
"I‚Äôve been looking for my journal but it‚Äôs nowhere in sight. The past couple of weeks I‚Äôve been nothing short of a fuck up.

I continuously upset my boyfriend because I don‚Äôt know how to express what exactly it is I‚Äôm feeling.. but how do I look at him and say I‚Äôve harmed myself for the past weekend after being clean for two-three years and that vivid images of harming or killing myself are on a constant replay within my mind?

"When I have been turned down by my wife after multiple attempts at intimacy I feel an overwhelming suffocating feeling that if my wife doesn't even love and desire me then who else could possibly ever feel like that towards me.

The feeling is like a tense constricting in my neck that just needs a noose to resolve once and for all. This is usually accompanied by a feeling of worthlessness and emptiness.

This leads to an almost insomniatic dwelling on this fact for a matter of hours before I can eventually doze off and get my mental reset (generally achieved with sleeping pills that take a while to kick in if not taken well before the depressive state).",0

"Hello.

I am a 31 year old female. All of my life I have suffered from severe inattentive ADHD and depression.  Victim of a narcissistic toxic family, labeled the black sheep. FF to my adult life. Survivor of domestic violence, then later unrelated a violent rape. 2 years ago now almost 3 I lost custody of my son. He is 9 now.  I see him every Wednesday, Friday, and every other Saturday. The coparent is a narcissist who is extremely controlling and if it is not their way its no ones way. Always in the public eye, the one with the most money, never follows the order, constantly filling my child's head with manipulative bullshit. When its good its great but it always fleeting always temporary.     Over the past 9 years so many times I  have thought about finality.    I won't elaborate on that I think most of you can understand it.   

  
I want to change. I am so tired of living life this way. I am constantly physical exhausted, agitated, or just ready to give up.  The only time I feel any shred of happiness is when I am with my son or get to hear his voice on the phone. He is the only thing that keeps me going.   I am a first responder.  I am in RN school.   I start in August.   I want to get on a medication to help with my ADHD so that I can focus but also a medication that will help with my depression giving me energy, purpose and drive to get up and DO things throughout the day. On top of everything I severe anxiety.   I have tried so many different medications and want to know if anyone has any recommendations.   I am well aware that everyone is different and everyone responds differently.  I am going to respectfully ask the reddit community to not comment things like ""You need to talk to your doctor"" or ""Everyone responds to medication differently"".  I want to know what works for you.   I am going to list the medications that I have tried here and the side effects that I have had: 

Strattera-Currently on it. Not giving up just yet. Seriously bad anxiety. 40mg

Vyvanse: 20mg love it until it starts to wear off. Hype focusing. Make just get back on it.

Lexapro: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Trileptal: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Prozac: Giddy, would laugh inappropriately which happens to me a lot on antidepressants. 

Zoloft: Giddy, would laugh inappropriately. (This is for the first 2 weeks of most antidepressants with me. Its embarrassing and I work in direct patient care. I cannot be like this at work period.

Effexor XR: Very bad depression and a serious almost police involved attempt.

Trintellix: Bitchy and agitated

Cymbalta or Duloxetine: Serious anxiety for the first month of taking to the point where I had to get off.

Citalopram: Have been on it. Don't really remember it but I think anxiety.

Bupropion or Wellbutrin XR:  Bitchy and lightheaded. Did not really give it the best trial run. 

Lamictal: So aggressive and agitated that a trip to the ER and handcuffed to a chair

Geodon: Made me fall asleep in my food

Latuda: Craved sweets constantly 

Abilify: Made me slur my speech, crave sweets, felt sedated

Depakote: Made me slur my speech, rock back and forth, agitated

Topamax: Made extremely anxious, forget where I was going in traffic and literally how to drive

Caplyta: Crave sweets, weird dreams, crying spells

Clonazepam(Klonopin) Currently take PRN

Ativan: Serious memory issues.

Xanax: Depression.

Buspirone: Very bad headache did not manage anxiety effectively

Vistaril: Laughable did absolutely noting for my anxiety. Made my nose extremely dry. 

Those are all of the ones that I remember taking.  I need recommendations based purely on what has worked for others on antidepressants and ADHD medication. Thank you!",0
"It makes no sense since I know how hard depression can be from having it first-hand, I know the right thing to do is to be supportive when others are being vulnerable.

"I somehow became interested if there were levels of free-floating sadness/gloom even more severe than depression/dysthymia, and came upon melancholia. While it doesn‚Äôt look like I match enough symptoms, I did note with interest on one page that it‚Äôs very frequently comorbid with musculoskeletal aches/pains.

I immediately thought of my own teleporting minor aches (i.e. on the 1-10 pain scale, they‚Äôre generally 1, or even 0.5). I‚Äôd even tried bupropion briefly because of them (bupropion apparently also helps with fibromyalgia, and I figured it might be worthwhile to try it even if this were better called *pseudo*fibromyalgia, in case the underlying causes were different but not the ending nature of the aches), but quickly decided it dried out my mouth too much to endure. Next noticed thing: Melancholia usually gets treated with tricyclics, not SSRIs or SNRIs.

Tenuous-looking, but after sertraline and escitalopram losing strength and my being unsure about my current fluoxetine, I wonder if a tricyclic could quell *both* my gloom and the pseudofibro‚Ä¶(I forget why I ultimately decided it wasn‚Äôt actually fibromyalgia -_- )",0
"Let's start saying i (M15) don't want to kill myself, neither self harm (unless you count aggressively biting my nails :P).
I feel like i move by pure inertia. I waited a lot of time dreaming of having friends and hanging out with them, but now that i have really good friends, i feel too tired to hang out with them most of the times.
My life is pretty simple. I wake up, i go to school (not for now lol), i come home, i play videogames, i have dinner, i play videogames, i go to sleep. Every day. I've tried lots of sports and hobbies, but still i didn't find a passion, and I'm starting to lose hope in finding it.
And the fact is... That i both like and hate my life. I know i'm wasting my life saying at home doing nothing, but i never have the energies to get out of this trashy routine. if i start something, it's because it happens, in a way or another. 

I just broke up with my gf because she was basically flirting with her friends and she gave me very little attention compared to how much i cared about her, and now i'm sure i can't be loved anymore. No one will ever love me as i do. And everytime someone comforts me saying ""you'll find someone"", i thank them but deep down i know it's a lie said to make me happy.
If i rationally listed all the reasons to not kms (i repeat: i have 0 intention of doing so), i'd probably find out that they are way less than before.
I see being depressed as a goal now.

"Hi, I‚Äôm a 23(F) University student who has been struggling with diagnosed anxiety and depression for 9 years (7 years diagnosed). 
I get extremely anxious whenever I think about studying, am studying or when I know that I have to go back to uni soon. I haven‚Äôt been able to sleep well, so I often wake up depressed. It‚Äôs not that I have trouble falling asleep but I get depressing dreams or nightmares. Everytime anything related to my course or university pops up whether it‚Äôs an advertisement, part of a TV series, movie or I overhear conversations, I get rly anxious. 

I dropped out of my first course in 2021, took a gap year, started a new 1 year course in 2022 (graduated), basically took another year off due to inevitable placement delays, and is heading into my 2nd semester of first year doing an undergrad in psychological studies.

I‚Äôve been crying almost everyday and been trying to get my mind off things, but I still struggle a lot. Tbh, I have thought about seeing a psychologist again but just the thought of making appointments and finding time to actually talk already gives me anxiety. 
I‚Äôm already working PT and studying. 

Ik that probably focusing on studying is more important, but in this economy.. I can‚Äôt rly afford to quit my job bc I need it to pay for rent and for other expenses. 

I have no motivation for anything.. I constantly feel stressed and have negative suicidal thoughts however, Ik that I will never actually do it due to fear of pain. I want to leave this place so bad but I‚Äôm terrified of doing it. 

I used to have a career goal but university has been me change my mind twice, so now I feel stuck.. 

Atp, I‚Äôm just trying to get a degree for the sake  of my family so that they could back off a little bit when it comes to my life.

"I'm getting more and more confused as to how people can get out of watching any kind of light-hearted series and not be consumed by this giant void of shame, emptiness and nostalgia for something you never had. 

I've never got to experience being popular, or average, or being in a little outcast gang, or being part of a cool band. I was just alone all the time. too anxious for sports or anything p.e. related. I've never walked to any friends house, never got invited to any party. I live in this boring prison of a house in this boring neighborhood. I live in Brazil thus the schools aren't nearly as interesting as the stuff I see in North America or any other more developed part of the world, and the streets just aren't safe or spacious and green. literally makes me wish I lived in a cul-de-sac. the few friends I ""have"" have much more interesting lives and other things to pay attention to, so we hang out like once or twice a year. I'm just to tired of my life being inside a screen.

when I read these stories of people going through things *together*, or having difficult lives but a couple of friends or siblings to talk to or to casually hang out with, I just get so emotionally involved with them, their lives seem so normal, it's comforting and depressing at the same time, because it's just fiction, it's not really there, they're not my friends, I can't interact with them. and when I finish the story after growing so attached to the characters I just have this moment that I want to cry on the pillow for like half an hour. sorry if this is too uncomfortable to know but I feel so much like shit that I literally don't feel like doing that private thing teens usually do. I literally can't do something so normal because I'm feeling too shit. and then thoughts of self harm flow through my head. it's been like this for years and idk I just think that this shouldn't be normal for a teenager, I don't deserve this, I really don't think I do.",0

"Honestly I felt so stupid and dramatic writing all this but I‚Äôll post it anyway because idc anymore. 

I‚Äôve been depressed and feeling suicidal for about 3 months now but things have gotten majorly worse in the past couple weeks. I don‚Äôt know how I make it through every day, I‚Äôm so bored and there‚Äôs nothing I enjoy anymore. The only reason I‚Äôve made it until now is my family and my dog. However my family are going on holiday without me in 2 days. This is like the 5th time they‚Äôve done it because I have severe anxiety and I can‚Äôt go with them. This time though, I REALLY need them. I‚Äôve tried expressing what I‚Äôm feeling and had the help of my mental health worker too but they‚Äôre going anyway. My MH worker thinks they should go too and I‚Äôll cope better than I think I will. I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they‚Äôre the only thing keeping me going. And while they‚Äôre away my dog is going to the kennels because I can‚Äôt even look after her by myself. 

I‚Äôve expressed these thoughts mostly to my MH worker who has relayed them to my family but my family don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt tell them these things myself. I‚Äôve told them it‚Äôs very difficult. I‚Äôve expressed the fact I want to die to all of them (MH worker and family) and I felt like they under reacted. Maybe they think I‚Äôm being dramatic and I wouldn‚Äôt actually do anything, which was true up until now but now I‚Äôm in such an awful place I don‚Äôt trust myself not to try to hurt myself or kms. Tonight I self harmed for the first time. I didn‚Äôt do much and am too much of a wimp to be honest but I had an urge to do it. I feel like I‚Äôm a manipulative bitch because it feels like the urge came from me wanting them to see how bad things are. I still have the urge to do more but like I said, I‚Äôm a wimp. Anyway I feel like if I tell my parents, everything will blow up. They get so stressed out about me and I know they need a break but I can‚Äôt survive that right now. I honestly feel so stuck. Dying seems like the only way out. 

I‚Äôve also had intrusive thoughts about hurting other people. Like I said, I don‚Äôt trust myself. I would never do anything like that in my right mind but clearly I‚Äôm not in my right mind right now and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll go crazy and snap. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do. If I don‚Äôt let my family go I feel like they‚Äôll resent me. But it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs even any way I can make them not go. So therefore suicide seems like the only way out. But nobody believes I would do that. I‚Äôm so stuck. ",0
"
Every day I feel more useless and helpless, I don't know what to do anymore :(
Some context: me and my best friend have been friends for about 5 years, she's had depression for as long as I can remember. We are both minors and we go to different schools, so we don't see each other very often and most of the time we only talk via chat. She has self-harmed several times before and, even if she thankfully hasn't attempted ending her life, she has thought about it. Ever since she started telling me about her depression and her problems, I did everything I could to help her. Unfortunately, because I didn't know how to react to that kind of situation, I think I ended up doing more harm than good. I would sometimes lash out at her, minimizing her feelings and overall saying very hurtful things that I didn't really mean. I know it was wrong and I feel terribly guilty about it. Apparently, because of this, she has become more reserved with me and no longer tells me her problems.

I'm trying to become a better person for her so I try to ask her if she's okay (when I can, since we don't talk much right now). She just told me that she was a little sad. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said no, but hinted that she tried to hurt herself yesterday (she had done it before, I managed to stop her for a while but to no avail as she did it again). I honestly didn't know what to say. It stresses me out a lot that she doesn't tell me what's happening to her since I don't know how can I help her, but at the same time I know that I can't force her to tell me, especially after how I was to her. I really don't want her to hurt herself and I feel very sad to hear it, especially since she promised me she wouldn't do it again but she ended up doing it anyway. But I know I don't have to take it personally since this doesn't have anything to do with me. It just  distresses me so much to know that she's going through so much suffering, to the point of wanting to hurt herself, and I can't do anything at all.

So, in summary: how do I get her to open up to me again? How can I be a good friend to her? And, in the best case scenario, how can I make sure she doesn't have thoughts like that anymore and hopefully feels better? Thank you very much in advance :)",0
"I‚Äôve been battling depression for most of my life, everyone has told me it‚Äôll get better. I used to have hope but I no longer have hope for the future as I get older. I don‚Äôt care that I‚Äôm young (22) I don‚Äôt want to live in this society that we‚Äôve created. Everything is so unbelievably depressing. Work, home, repeat.

It‚Äôs hard making friends as an adult and I don‚Äôt have any now, I don‚Äôt think I ever will.

I think we were just put here to suffer and I‚Äôve done that enough. I‚Äôve travelled, I‚Äôve moved to different cities, I‚Äôve moved back to my hometown to be closer to family, I‚Äôve laughed and I‚Äôve cried and cried and cried. I am so tired of my unhappiness, I know it‚Äôs so bad I‚Äôm affecting other people. When I was at work the other day a customer asked me why I looked so sad and I just shrugged it off. I‚Äôve been to copious amounts of therapy and from that I‚Äôve learned that I am the master of my own universe and I am the one that has to put in the work to be better and make my life better. But I have no desire to, I don‚Äôt see the point. All of this is meaningless and monotonous. My family will be sad and it pains me to know that, I wish I could just vanish without causing them pain.

"Hi all,

Pretty much done with life rn. One thing people often mention, but I do not think emphasize enough, is how badly depression feeds into itself. 

I went all in on my last relationship of 3.5 years. I got depressed like 8 months in (not her fault) and slowly kept burning all kinds of bridges around me. 

When she decided her bridge was no longer meant for me, I realized I am a completely solitary island now. 

Was I fine with it for awhile? Yea. Do I still feel safe when I‚Äôm alone? Yea. But anyone who‚Äôs been here will tell you deep down they wish they had a support system but it‚Äôs so difficult to start from scratch. 

It‚Äôs wild how easily I made friends when I *already had* tons of friends. same with women. 

So now, yea, in a couple quick years I went from having a dreamy life to having no people on Earth who care about them. The physical toll has shown too, as I‚Äôve lost about 30-35 lbs (already skinny). 

Really really don‚Äôt know where to go. I‚Äôve tried reaching out to old friends, it‚Äôs mostly unsuccessful and quite soul crushing. Any advice? I fantasize about the big end every night rn.",0
"I've really been trying fix my life

I've made so many mistakes and at times I feel like I'm not good at anything.

I wasn't good in school

I tried going into the military. To get college money, try to get motivated into being a better person, get into better shape, and have time to figure out what I wanna do in life.

Reality wise, I wasn't good at it, was even more depressed and fell into a cycle of barely passing my fitness while also getting more demotivated and still had no idea what I wanted out of life.

So after 4 years I knew I wasn't a good fit for this role and would have eventually been kicked out so I wanted get out, get a regular paying security guard gig as a temporary thing to do something easy while I figure things out.

fast forward 6 years later, mediocre pay with a crappy job and I'm not any closer to figuring out my life than I was at 18 when it was time to get a job and try to make something of my life.

So I asked my dad for some advice. He gave me a couple ideas, one leading into HVAC technician.

Seemed like something I could get into.

I used my GI bill, went to school, got training and everything seemed great. Then I tried applying to jobs but no one would hire me

Got a job at Circle K maintenance, cause they made it seem like they needed people with experience in plumbing, electrician, and HVAC. But reality wise I'm not doing anything HVAC related (they keep telling me they wanna do that eventually but I don't know if eventually is 5 months or 5 years)

So after 6 months of being a glorified janitor, I try applying for other jobs again

Got an interview for an actual HVAC company only to find out how little I actually know of the field and how much competition there actually is.

Its gotten to the point where any choice I make I feel like I'll never make something of myself, I feel like no matter what I do I keep fucking up and keep failing

I feel like no matter how many times I try to climb out of this hole, the hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper and I just keeping slipping to the bottom.

And what if I get into the HVAC industry and I'm not even good at it, like how I'm not good at anything.

I'm 31 years old and I feel like I have nothing to show for my life.",0

is hopeless, every time I exhale i can feel a void in my stomach through the spine, the physical reaction to emotional pain, my hands go numb and ache. This is no way of living.

"I haven't really told or opened up like this to anyone but after seeing people open up on here and the support, I thought I could try as well. 

I'm \[19F\] currently starting my second sem of uni and honestly...its not going how I planned at all. I failed three courses, am eating horribly and generally not feeling like myself anymore to the point where I don't even want to eat, drink or do anything cuz it makes me sick to my stomach at the fact that I...am alive? idk how to describe it. My moods constantly change so fast it's like getting whiplash, I can't face my peers without being revolted in myself and honestly...im so tired of feeling like this. My family are disappointed in my behaviour and my friends try to help but it's just them being like 'don't take it too seriously' or 'oh no, you're fine'. I can't listen to music or find any entertainment anymore cuz this stress is just eating at my brain like a damn parasite and I absolutely hate it.

I tried searching up these things online everything says I might have depression or anxiety but I guess in my mind I don't want to accept that cuz if I do the reality of it all sinks in. In my culture it's kinda taboo talking about mental health and stuff so my family tries to help but it's mostly just 'people have it worse than you', 'stop being dramatic', and the classic 'it's your phone that's the problem'. Part of me knows they are right but it doesn't really help. Im still 19 and can't secure a job, not very open and social and now I have to worry about some immigration issues or else my whole family could risk getting deported. 

Basically, my dad has been trying to secure a stable resident status abroad for almost a decade now and failed. And since we are considered immigrants here, we've been living as international people the whole time- despite living here for 10 years by 2025. It's honestly drained our whole family to the point where we haven't even gone out to a restaurant to eat or enjoyed life for so long. My parents fight constantly and I have to put everything aside to mediate them and be the therapist for everyone since I was 10. But now that I'm considered an adult and have finished primary and high school here, I have a chance at changing it all and gaining residency for my family. 

Naturally, I'm ecstatic that I can finally do something about this situation but with everything else, I'm so scared that I'll screw this up too. My dad says I should take a gap year and secure this, since the process might take about three years but I'm already enrolled and have started 2nd year of uni. I've been trying to find the course I need to do while juggling uni but the intakes available are only in Jan 2025 and it makes me even more hopeless cuz by then I'll already be 20, while my friends are all way ahead of me and thriving. I honestly just feel stuck in my life and even after I tried to stay positive and not take things too seriously, it still weighs me down so much mentally and emotionally. 

ps- this was really long, sorry but...I feel a bit better getting it off my chest lol...thanks! ",0

I can absolutely see myself being single until the literal day I die. Every single day off for me is spent alone, eating or sleeping. That‚Äôs literally it. My idea of a day out is going out myself to get food and that‚Äôs literally it.

I‚Äôve thought about taking my own life before, but I always knew that I‚Äôd never do it. As time has gone on, the thought becomes less and less terrifying. Knowing that this is what the rest of my life will be like makes me fear that one day the feeling will grow so strong that I just off myself. What‚Äôs there to stop me? I know that the pain of losing a loved one goes away, and someone like me taking their own life would be an incredibly easy loss to swallow. I feel burdened with my own existence.

I‚Äôve been getting pressured for the past few months to get a job by my siblings (only been out of a job for a few months now and they‚Äôve been pushy since day one. I was employed for 5 years and only left when the business closed down) .

"I dont think I remember the last time someone genuinely returned the efforts or even seemed to enjoy having me in their lives. every relatives too busy doing their own thing so like we only meet up once every blue moon unless its the usual but even they tend to seem less interested in me as a person. I have had so many failed ""friendships"" that I just end up not caring for people anymore. In fact I would not care if society or this earth didnt exist, its a hellhole trying to find somewhere to belong and trying to do well at something.

I also cant count the amount fo general bullshit I have had to deal with over this life. yet people seem forgetful or clueless when it clmes to their own behaviour often telling me its just a joke or outright invalidating everything I say or feel thus making me withdraw from others. I try to care about the latest thinfs but I dont feel overly attached to nothing, people mostly seem to have a statement to say to me then thats all there is to the conversation, nothing more nothing less just nothing for me to go on because theyre not putting their share of effort into it.

For example I have one ""friend"" whos clearly the type that has 100s of other friends online but she has such little effort with me that I often wonder why I bother with her in the first place. She only seems to message me when say theres an online quiz or some other shit otherwise again she doesnt seem to notice that I go months without hearing from nobody. Sometimes I question if I am even real because I cant find no place to fit in no matter what I try theres people who try to get me into unfair situations or unhelpful situations theres been endless counts fo gossiping but no one else but myself has noticed it so no one else has even tried to prevent it, people just make snarky comments judgemental looks at me even for merely trying to exist in a social setting. For example I was in an outdoor store and there were two old hags in there at the same time as myself and my mum, and they were outright sideeying me and whispering just loud enough for me to hear it and they inly stopped when I stared back.

I feel like its got worse with social media because I try not to feel so bored, lonely and done with this whole ""life"" thing but when I aint got no one else to hang out with cause people have turned me down in the past even if I made the suggestions yet they would happily do things with other people and post about it online. it basically rubs in my face that they really never did care or simply they do not need me in their life. Or that their life is some how more interesting than mine. Thus leading to me feeling fomo for not being able to get anywhere and society always says its never too late but it does get to a point where everyone else my age has something going for them and people judge anyone my age for not being at the same point as everyone else.

In lockdown I tried reaching out to former classmates but only got one response and I expected him to reply but havent heard nothing since and it feels weird to message someone who got their life and he got his own family together yaknow? what do I do? theres literally nowhere else I can find my ""people"" and it sucks when O have to witness younger people being able to do more or have their own group and then they can share it online for anyone else to oggle at.

I dont mean nothing special to nobody. its fact at this point. if you arent rich no one cares, if you arent popular no one cares, if u quiet no one going to give u enough chance to socialise because everyone so mf loud and attention seeking, if you arent rich then also no one cares for you.

People just dont want long meaningful connections outside of the people they have around them, I might as well be a mf ghost as well cause people fucking act like im not part of anyones lives as it is.

The friend that message me about the quiz didnt even ask nothing not a hello, how are you? not a what are your latest interests? I thought it was bad in school but with social media and smartphones it feels sp alienating? everyone else so busy with their lives and showcasing it online they aint caring about those they leave behind. Even people that are on rhe street get more attention than myself they wouldnt dare ask me what I been doing and I cant think of nothing to say because in social situations those loud enough get most the attention and hog all the conversations so even if someone ask me I get maybe 5 seconds and one sentence out of it.

You have to actually force yourself to find something worthwhile to care about be it sports or some other stupid celebrities or movie series because it seems thats the only way people would ever have anything in common enough tonwant to converse with you. otherwise they dont care how you feel, they dont care what you doing if it not anything relevant to themselves. I dont want gifts I want deep meaningful connections that last in the long run where we check up on one another but even with social fucking media people dont put that saame effort badk make me wonder why I shouldnt just put myself 6 feet under

Eeven the arupid retarded part time job I couldnt make that last and if I did anything to try to socialise people either didnt care for what I say, the younger folk already had their own group and the manager would pretend to be nice but then snitch about me to her mamager and thus it seemed like I cant get nothing out of it anymore.

also, my other friend also got mad at me the other day because i wouldn‚Äôt tell her how i was doing (although she is VERY pushy when it comes to this sort of thing and the last time i told her it ended up with me being safeguarded). 

i‚Äôve been in a constant loop since i was 10. i feel numb for a while and then go into a really deep state of utter sadness (which lasts around 2-3 months, the numbness can last anywhere between 1-2 months). 

i believe that i have had depression for a really long time, i‚Äôm currently on the waiting list to be diagnosed for ADHD and i‚Äôve made it clear to my therapist that i wanted a diagnosis for depression but she just pretty much ignored me.

i‚Äôm my own enemy, i bottle things up so much and i don‚Äôt know why i just can‚Äôt open my mouth and talk to anyone. in fact, the bottling up led to two attempts in february because i felt so alone, i also started sh again after 2 months sober.

"I am M28 and I think I am lost and I don't know what to do with my life.
I feel like everything I do fells apart and nothing is going my way.


I have never been in a relationship and since last year I started to develop feelings for a girl who is also my colleague. Recently I confessed her but she said she doesn't have any feelings for me.
Now I don't know what to do I can't get over her and the only this comes to my mind is her.

My family is also pushing me to get married but due to this girl I am not in a mood to get into relationship with any other girl or to get married.


I have a corporate job and I have been there for 6 years in the same company.
Now due to office politics my growth is stopped and the pay is average.
I always get into an argument with my boss and this is also affecting me.
I am trying to switch jobs but for every company I apply I don't even hear back from them.


I have also going through some financial crunch too. My salary just vanishes, even if I try to be more careful with my money, something will come up and i will runout of the money by end of the month.


2-3 years ago I came to know that my father had an affair with someone close to my family. My father and mother are married for like 35 years. The relationship my parents have is like a relationship of compromise.
They just pretend they are partners but they just don't have love for each other.
I check phone of my father every now and then and I notice my father even texts to that women even now.


Due to this I don't want to get married,just for the sake of getting married...

And the girl I love doesn't love back..

I don't know what to do, its like I just wake up , go to office , come back , go to gym , sleep and go back to office..

I have only few close friends and now the list is getting smaller.

I cannot speak of all of this to anyone and I do know what to do...",0

"im 16, me and my sister never really talked about stuff like this, nor did she and my parents (including me). when i was her age i was severely depressed aswell, but i had nobody to talk to so i had to deal with everything myself. plus i had severe social anxiety which made me feel more alone so i never fully got the concept of having support in my life, or going to therapy or even having real friends to talk to. btw, im somewhat okay now

  
moving on to my sister: shes somewhat social. she hit puberty over half a year ago. she completely changed her looks. she started wearing black, baggy clothes and spends one hour doing full face make up, which our family wasnt so happy of, including me, since it was so sudden and she doesnt even need it. but honestly i dont care about these things. anyway, she has a couple of friends but ive heard she has gotten into a fight with one of them which she has mentioned a couple of times to me and my family but we kinda brushed it off since she didnt really wanna talk about it either. then she has gotten a boyfriend, whom she broke up with 2 weeks later into the relationship because he cheated. and honestly she didnt seem affected by it, i think its clear why. 

main thing she does is keep her room really messy. like insanely messy. about 5 hrs age there was leftover food on the floor, flies everywhere, sticky desk, make up stains everywhere and so on.... my dad were obvously not happy. he came and had a meltdown about her room. yesterday and today to the point where he took her phone. i could tell my sister was upset cuz she didnt go out at all, only to the bathroom for like 5mins. and this happens quite often. i can relate to this aswell, i could even say its normal in our family to get yelled at this much for our rooms but its really apparent she doesnt take it well. on top of that my parents tell everyone INCLUDING ME that she has an ""additue"" and she needs to fix it. but its just her being upset for my dad contantly yelling at her. theres many other things id mention but it would be too much. and on top of that, one of her friends moms told our mom that my sister and her friend were talking about how shes self harming, how she feels worthless ect. and its just so weird to me, why are u spying on my sister? and after that incident she has been wwearing a hoodie for the past 2 weeks. keep in mind its really hot where we live. and its just overall unusual.

  
anyway, i dont use tiktok, snd she does every day. so i had the random thought to check out her account, and it was full of depressed stuff. she was talking about how in her mind, shes fat,and she should stop eating less, or how she was hurting herself and had suicidal thoughts just because our parents got mad because she didnt clean her room. and thats when i got the idea of telling this to someone, because i seriously dont know how to approach this. maybe i should tell my mom, since shes more understanding than my dad. but talking to my sister wouldnt be a great idea since like i said, im still healing from my own things. i dont know how to confort people let alone my sister that im not that close with to this extend.

"I thought I was stable. I wasn't. 

I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

After they got what they needed, you're just like some trash that didn't exist. This really hurts the most especially if the person you didn't expect was the one whom you poured your heart the most.

Not only was my heart and my trust broken but also my hope for love. It's always been this kind of situation since college, which was 9 years ago.

"For the first time in my life, I am overweight and extremely depressed. I‚Äôm in treatment. I go about twice a week, but I don‚Äôt have my own car. I‚Äôm 31. I‚Äôm single I don‚Äôt have any friends.

There are some days where I can‚Äôt even get myself out of bed and I just piss in a bottle. and I‚Äôm not even overweight. I‚Äôm just around 200 pounds.  And it‚Äôs different for me because most of my life I weighed 160.. I‚Äôm stuck in a house with smokers and it doesn‚Äôt help my asthma, but it‚Äôs literally the only place I could go without being on the street. Hopeless, I feel like I‚Äôll never be good enough for anybody even though I try and remind myself that those are mine traps and I need to try and be positive. I just can‚Äôt do it. I say I can‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt like a cop out there times I‚Äôve sat for hours at a time trying to think myself out of my depression. There‚Äôs been so many times I‚Äôve told myself OK this is what the situation is. I just need to accept that and find something good about it and no matter how many times I try and do that I end up back at square one. Feel like I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt really have any family. I mean, I have my mom and she‚Äôs helping take care of me but we have for the most part of pretty terrible relationship. My brother doesn‚Äôt speak to me and none of my extended family is in communication with me and I think it‚Äôs partially because, I was never really around them that much so it just normally happened that I went through my life without being around them. I mix and I live in a town that pretty racist. Not to mention everybody in this house things the lgbt is an agenda and gossips behind each others backs.

I feel powerless, I feel like life controls me and I have no control. I hate that I want control, I hate that I can‚Äôt be content but this isn‚Äôt some way to live. My only hope is low income housing and to find a low hours job while I wait for help with my SSI. I can‚Äôt do things on my own and nobody is helping me fast enough to get to a safe place.. I‚Äôm doing everything on my end to show up and reach out. But ‚Ä¶ the thing about suicide and why I‚Äôm reluctant is because the fact of me killing myself knowing nobody will be held accountable is , well, it‚Äôs fucked.

"I‚Äôm a 18 yr old female. 
A lot of what I see on here i more normal I worry that what I‚Äôm about to say isn‚Äôt or that I will be judged. Please I just want help.

I have homicidal thoughts. I hate it. I hate most that I could do it and possibly get away with it. On a metric scale I‚Äôm attractive. So I know I could get them to follow me and do as I say till they realize what‚Äôsabout to happen. For background I was abused severely when put into the care of my aunt for a few years. I was sexually abused and was having hard drugs tested on me regularly by her boyfriend. After going back to my parents life was better until my dad passed. Watching him die in the street was the hardest thing I‚Äôve had to endure. My homicidal thoughts began as nightmares I would see people bleeding out but never be able to make out any distinct features. It quickly escalated as I began hunting animals like deer. It went to intrusive thoughts about harming strangers, most of them had nothing in common except the fact that they where men. After meeting my friend we‚Äôll call her Lilly it stopped momentarily. Until she committed. After that it was stronger than before. It became an itch burried in my skin I couldn‚Äôt reach, id try to scratch it till the skin was falling off it quickly became something that caused se me to almost twitch even in public. And the thoughts became more gruesome, I‚Äôd think of setting them loose in the woods and hunting them. I made a list of all the sex offenders in my city and watch them when I can. Staring at them and stalking. Hunting. There where moments if I staved myself enough that I didn‚Äôt feel the urge as much do to pure exhaustion. I‚Äôm introverted but do well socially so when I reconnected with my highschool friend who well call j it stopped for a moment just like with Lilly. I‚Äôm some ways he reminds me of her in his own way. The feeling of safety and comfort. After a while we confessed we had feeling for each other but due to his religion we didn‚Äôt and haven‚Äôt so much as kissed. And in someways I think that‚Äôs something I love about our situation. That it‚Äôs pure. Recently my thoughts have been coming back resulting in SH to try to stop them. I love him just like I did Lilly. I want these thoughts to stop. I want to have a normal life. Another factor that makes this so hard it that most days I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm even alive. It feels like it not real. Like nothing is. So I struggle finding ways to change when I‚Äôm not sure what happening to me.

"Why does hating myself and depression help me perform better in all areas of life. Hating myself gives me a reason to improve myself and helps me look at myself more objectively and value myself and tasks etc to 1s and 0s. My weight loss and gym journey has become significantly better. I track macros pretty casually. Locked in at university and grades are improving, my gym sessions are more intense. Less shy around strangers, friends, work colleagues, my superiors.(i just treat everyone equally). My social and professional life is improving( It was decent before). 
But here comes the problem, with progression should come a sense of fulfillment.Instead i still feel like something is lacking. I still desire more hatred as i feel like it will push me more but where do i stop. I have come to understand from my friends, family and etc that i devalue myself too much( i think of myself as worth nothing ), take too many risks and am low-key self destructive. Apparently it is a sign of depression but at the same time it helps me get the mindset of  because I‚Äôm worth nothing, everything is a gain from this point. 
My point of this text is though things are getting better why do i feel lacking, and why do i keep craving more self hatred. Why don‚Äôt i think more positively like others and look for more optimistic ways of self improvement. Things being good makes me feel stagnant. I even miss a certain level of chaos in my life. I just need a fresh perspective that can help me navigate through whatever this is. Is something wrong with me?",0
I‚Äôm 16 years old and have been struggling with depression silently for years. My parents have been somewhat aware but only decided to get me help a few months ago. So many psychiatrist offices don‚Äôt have any availability. They had to call countless places and talk to a doctor just to find one that would see me. At this point I felt mostly past the point of being helped and was wary about getting my hopes up and being disappointed. But I couldn‚Äôt help the feeling deep inside me that thought this was my chance to finally get better. I‚Äôd dreamed of this day for years. We went to the first appointment and spoke to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and suggested I go on medication. She referred me to another psychiatrist in the office who was better suited for my needs and we set up my first session to be the week after. However the next week when we showed up we found out that the therapist I was supposed to see decided to take time off. I cried as soon as I got home. I was so disappointed. Despite my better judgement I truly believed I would finally get the help I desperately needed. I was so close. The little hope I had is gone and replaced with hurt. ,0

"I live a fairly fine life, a good house, and food to eat, not rich or anything but not poor either. I am well-loved by my family so it amazes me why I push them away and can't show affection. Ever since I was a tween I have always felt some sort of misery. It was so sudden you would have thought a nefarious witch came and cursed me. I wouldn't consider myself a good person, quite the opposite actually. I have worked on getting better, disregarding my insensitivity, and bettering my inferiority complex but little has made a difference. Because even though I am extremely sensitive to others' feelings in a way, I tend to still be indifferent when they show me, love. I have no real life skills as a teenager as a result of being spoiled my whole life. Almost everything has been given to me in a platter, and I take it always with a grain of salt. I have fairly good friends, but I lost most of them because of my personality. During quarantine, my whole mentality rotated to a 360¬∞ I was badly influenced and out of control. And now that whole demented persona is just stuck. The main reason I want to die is because I feel like I am better off dead. I don't bring anything to the house instead of being a student and attending school. But other than that, I am truly a burden. I can't do house chores without people telling me to because I feel judged. I don't know why and how. My looks also play a part, I am extremely unsettling to look at, and I do not have the best personality either as mentioned. I have so many imperfections I don't even look human, no matter how much I try to see it. I feel like I disgrace the world just by existing. To add fire to the fuel, I don't have any good talents, I don't sing, or dance, and the best I could do is get an above-average grade in the class. It bothers me how I can be ""good"" but can't be the ""best"" in academics. The only passion I have is reading, I love to read. But of course, all good things come to an end, and I have been little by little reaching a slump. I don't know what to feel. I don't know what to do. 

It's like I am a body without a soul. Maybe I have been programmed this way my whole life, I cannot think of a single trauma that can cause this. I don't know what I did in my past life to end up in this state. I truly believe I am better off dead.

"Hi everyone,

I am a 16-year-old female, and I‚Äôve noticed some significant issues with myself. Unfortunately, I can't get a proper diagnosis because my parents are against it. Here are the problems I've been facing:

1. Academic Performance: I used to excel in academics until the 10th grade, scoring 95% in my exams. However, this was below my expectations, leading to burnout. Since then, I've subconsciously put in less effort, resulting in a significant drop in my grades in the 11th grade. Even when I try, it doesn't seem to be enough. I now experience extreme exam anxiety, which causes me to freeze and lose focus during exams, despite knowing the material.

2. Action Paralysis: I often find myself unable to start tasks, even when I want to and know I need to. Deadlines pass, and I‚Äôm unable to take action, which has severely impacted my productivity.

3. Attention Issues: My ability to pay attention has deteriorated significantly. I struggle to focus on anything for long periods, and this has been an issue for a while but has worsened recently.

4. Emotional Numbness: For the past year, I‚Äôve felt emotionally numb and detached from everything in life. I don‚Äôt feel happiness, sadness, or any strong emotions, positive or negative. I also struggle to care about anything, which makes me feel worse, but I don‚Äôt even care about feeling worse.

5. Anxiety and Disorganization: My anxiety attacks have intensified. I frequently lose items, am very messy, and often disconnect from conversations, going blank for a while. I‚Äôve lost interest in activities I once enjoyed, like working out. My daily routine, which used to drive me, now lacks structure and consistency.

6. Chronic Fatigue: I am always tired, regardless of how much rest I get.

Despite multiple attempts to improve my situation and get my grades back up, I keep failing to stick to my commitments and feel all over the place.

Can anyone offer advice or help on how to manage these issues?

Thank you.",0

But nothing was helping and I fell deeper and deeper. I had a weak moment and I latched onto attention I felt from another male. I thought holy shit someone actually showing me they like me? Someone actually having conversations with me? Someone who understands the depression and anxiety I am dealing with? I fell for it. And I fucked up. And that one mistake has flipped my families life upside down. I destroyed the man who loves me. My kid has to see her parents cry every single day. What the hell have I done?

All the emotions and self hatred start flooding back in, and it feels like all the work I did was for nothing. So what‚Äôs the point? It‚Äôs never going to end. I hate it. I hate being so weak.

I am in my late 20s and for the longest time, I have not been able to do much with my life or accomplish anything. 
A little background, I was good until highschool, I did more or less well academically and was pretty academically inclined, was considered smart and everything. The problem started when I finished highschool, I took a few years off(because of some issues) so I started college late, it already took a toll on my confidence and I felt too old and too late for everything. 

Eventually I finished college and I haven‚Äôt been able to accomplish anything else eversince. 
I blamed it all on my laziness, I rationalised myself blaming my failures on my laziness and lack of trying. 
But since last year, I really made a conscious effort to try. I really did try so hard mentally to focus on the task at hand, made small goals to accomplish, made a routine for myself. But I noticed that I could never focus on anything for more than 20 mins at most. Even though I would make a mental note to not let anything distract myself, I would find myself hours later being distracted by the smallest of things and would feel like shit for having wasted all those time and it would repeat all over again. 
I tried to lock my phone up somewhere far away from my room thinking it was the source of my distraction but my mind would still find something else to waste my time on. It became a mental torture at this point. 
It seems like I would rather do literally anything else than the task at hand it doesn‚Äôt even have to be enjoyable at that point. 
It‚Äôs like my mind has another mind of its own and i lose control of it. 
This has caused me some major distress. 

Another thing i‚Äôve noticed that, nothing feels natural and comfortable to me. 
For example, even when i‚Äôm doing a simple task of doing laundry, holding my clothes or the jar of detergent feels uncomfortable and unnatural to me, like i‚Äôm not holding it properly or something. Everything I do feels wrong and uncomfortable.

"I am 29m severe depression, PTSD, ADHD and anxiety. I fought my way and got a good career and immigrated to Europe. I tried meds, weekly therapy, going out, events, meeting people, gaming, even several posts, everything I can.

I lost desire to do anything and have no want to do anything. The healthcare system in the Netherlands is very stressed and can't do more for an expat. I don't have the courage to suicide.

"Hi all,
this is gonna be a long post so many thanks in advance for your precious help.
I‚Äôm struggling to cope with my boyfriend‚Äôs depression as I don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on in his head, therefore I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the best thing to do to help him and us as a couple.
So - to give you a bit of background: we‚Äôve been together since last November; when we met and started dating we realised we weren‚Äôt just physically attracted to each other - we had lots of things in common and saw life the same way. When ok, he really is an amazing partner, very caring and supportive. I felt (and still feel) very lucky to have him. He disclosed his depression struggles to me from the beginning; he suffered from it all his life (he‚Äôs 28 now) and that is due to his bad upbringing/bad life experiences, + a feeling of being powerless to change things which are wrong in society.
When I got to know him better, I started to see his depression episodes unfolding and I also learned to see when they start as he becomes very apathetic and tells me he feels ‚Äúcold and empty‚Äù. I‚Äôve been observing the pattern and the length of these episodes varies: they may go from a few days to more serious ones which last a few weeks. During these episodes he bottles up, doesn‚Äôt go to work and neglects himself - he just lays in bed with no strength for anything; needless to say, during these times he disappears from me too and sometimes without warning (we don‚Äôt live together). When he‚Äôs ok and back to normal, he always tells me not to worry as he adores me so I should never take his illness personally - he just needs a break from everything as he can‚Äôt deal with anything. He doesn‚Äôt want to take medications and never did; I fully support this decision as I 100% agree. He simply wants to find the core reason of the problem and deal with it himself. He recently started to see a psychologist once or twice a week, but I can‚Äôt really see any improvement: some days he feels very happy and hopeful but some others (the majority of them) he‚Äôs back to his struggles. Now I know that depression is a serious disease and it may take him years to get over it, but my questions are: will he ever be able to fully recover from it, or he will have to embrace the illness all his life? Is it possible for me to get used to it and for us to have a fulfilling relationship despite this?
I‚Äôm asking you because he doesn‚Äôt want to talk too much about it with me.
Also, I tend to worry a lot when he disappears without warning, as I can‚Äôt help but questioning his feelings for me or - even worse - I start getting paranoid that he may kill himself. He told me more than once that he never feels suicidal, just apathetic so not to worry. However, I can‚Äôt help but texting him and telling him I miss him and I hope he‚Äôs ok, but I don‚Äôt usually get a reply during these episodes so I really feel left out.
As a partner, what‚Äôs the best thing to do/way to deal with him disappearing? Should I not contact him at all knowing that he will come back to me when the episode subsides?
I look forward to getting some insight from other people who struggle (or did struggle) with depression. Thank you so much!!",0
"I'm 29 years old and have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. The past year has been the worst it's ever been, living on autopilot, getting no joy out of almost everything, thoughts of dying daily. The one thing that would always keep me going was my wonderful girlfriend. Without her I'm not sure I'd be here today. Just being with her was enough to keep me going, she was the one thing that never failed to make me happy. I never shared any of this with her. I was so afraid of losing her if she saw how truly broken I am. The past year has been so rough, I know I haven't been the partner she deserves. I've felt so numb, stagnant, so tired and despite my efforts to hide these things they've bled through into my life. Making me into someone I wish I wasn't. She deserves so much more than that. She left me two days ago and I am completely broken. I was barely holding on before but now I don't know if I can. I let my depression take away the one good thing in my life. I'm so afraid to die, I don't think there's anything after this. I don't want it to hurt. I'm too scared to do it but I don't want to be alive. I'm afraid that I'll get the courage to actually do something. Not really looking for advice I just needed to get all this out, I have no one to talk to about it.

"If I wrote everything that happened to me, people would say, ‚ÄúWow, you‚Äôre a fighter‚Äù or ‚ÄúTry to find happiness.‚Äù The thing is, I kinda stopped having feelings when my mom passed away from an aneurysm. It happened out of nowhere. She was my best friend, and I was only 13 when it happened. I lost my person that day, and as months passed, I noticed my brother seemed sad but was and still is distant from my dad. My brother revealed to me that my dad was having an affair. He knew this before my mom passed away but decided not to tell her because he didn‚Äôt want to make her feel sad or lonely. I understood that, but my world fell apart when he told me about this. I knew why my dad didn‚Äôt always come back from work, why I felt the urge to go to my mom‚Äôs bedroom and just hug her until I fell asleep.

My brother and I confronted my dad, and he admitted it. He also told us he had a kid with this woman. That phrase took everything from me. I met this woman and even lived with her for a few years. She is the worst: so mean, yelling at me for no reason. I always cried because my dad knew this but never did anything about it. My brother started a new life; he got married and had a kid. My relationship with my brother is 1/10 because of this, so in a way, I lost my brother too. That woman and her son moved to another country, and now they live there. But a few weeks ago, I heard my dad calling them and using all these cute names for his son. It made me realize something: he was never like that with me. It made me feel like I‚Äôm not enough, like I‚Äôm not enough as a daughter to him. So I decided that maybe the best I can do is just live in peace with that. But still, I wish I had a father who didn‚Äôt decide to break his family.

I didn‚Äôt live with my father for a few months. I met a ‚Äúnice guy,‚Äù but I regret it with all my heart. He was my first, and he got me pregnant. I got an abortion. To this day, I have flashbacks of everything: the way he treated me, when I told him he got me pregnant and gave me an STI. All of this made me realize that since I lost my mom, I was looking for love in the wrong places. Sometimes I feel like this world is not for me. Not once do I feel happy. When I wake up, I feel like I‚Äôm not real. I feel numb. What is the purpose of me if I‚Äôm just going to feel this hurt? I don‚Äôt trust anyone. I don‚Äôt say anything to my friends. They think I‚Äôm okay, but I‚Äôm so tired of pretending. Nobody knows that the nights for me are the worst because I remember everything and I cry until I fall asleep. I feel used, and I don‚Äôt wish that on anyone.

There are signs that I‚Äôm depressed: my hair is thin, and I had the most beautiful curly hair, but now it‚Äôs so thin. I don‚Äôt go out. I decided to study online this year, so I‚Äôm always in my room. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone, not even my family, if I ever had a family. Sometimes I think that there are other worlds out there, and maybe in one of them, I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm happy with my mom, and I got to learn how to wear makeup, how to dress nicely, how to recognize good boys from the bad ones. I know this is just a group of people telling their feelings, and maybe I‚Äôm overreacting, but please be a good person. I would like to know that good people exist, and I hope one day I stop having this feeling of regret, of not being enough, of feeling used, of feeling that someone touched me and hurt me, and deciding that maybe it‚Äôs better if I just end this once and for all. Before all this, I was such a happy girl. I don‚Äôt remember her anymore.",0
"I've been very depressed and apathetic for the last 2 years now and I can confidently say I have nothing left to lose.

Like my conscious mind doesn't want be directly responsible for killing myself, so my brain is just making me depressed enough to kill myself through sheer apathy alone.

"hi, been dealing with intense depression and painful emotions from CPTSD after moving out, and I kind of just wanted to say somewhere that I don't think it's ever going to get better.

"Like the title says, I‚Äôm so tired of everything. Being depressed fucking sucks. I feel like I don‚Äôt have anyone in my life that would listen and take me seriously when I‚Äôm talking about my problems. My mum just says you are 23, how can you be depressed when you didn‚Äôt even experience life! There will be harder times that just a heartbreak! There are people that have cancer or people that are homeless! You can be lucky to have a roof over your head! How can you not be happy? Don‚Äôt you fucking think I don‚Äôt know that? Then one day it gets better and I‚Äôm laughing, and suddenly everybody thinks I‚Äôm okay. Cuz you can‚Äôt laugh when you are depressed right?

When I tell my family about wanting to off myself no one takes me seriously either. But I‚Äôm so tired of living, I can‚Äôt even picture myself when the hard things come, when I can‚Äôt even handle a fucking breakup and some school stress. I feel like I‚Äôm not made for life. I‚Äôm too weak for this all. 

It‚Äôs so nice outside but all I do is lie in bed and cry all day. I would love to go outside and go on some adventures, it‚Äôs summer break over all. But I have no one. My best friend is working all the time and when she‚Äôs not, she‚Äôs with her bf. And I don‚Äôt have any other friends like that. So I‚Äôm just a fucking loser that does nothing all day. I‚Äôm so jealous of people I see on instagram going on a vacation and just having fun. 

I hate this generation. All we do is scroll social media, and that fucks us up. We are all pushed to go to university, make more and more and more money, buy a house that will bankrupt you, be hot, workout or you will not reach today‚Äôs beauty standards. And then our parents ask us how can we be depressed when we are so young?

I live as the youngest sibling and only girl of my house. plus I grew up mostly having to figure out life by myself for most of my childhood. I lived in two houses for as long as I can remember one I lived in 5 years the other 4 which i still am in both of them being filled with garbage most of the time. since well my dad raised 3 of us by himself since my Mum is a drug addict other than that I have no friends and suffers from anxiety and depression at a young age as I'm starting to already fail to brush my teeth brush my hair and just make my bed at all my hygiene is in the trash now not to mention Everytime I look in the mirror or even see my reflection I just start to cry and even the smallest things can upset me its getting better but I still can't even imagine myself living up to 18 I already lost intrests in all the stuff I used to love and now I don't even know who I am what do I like now?? Are my brothers ok?? Is my dad gonna die one day and leave me here alone?? Just other stupid things like that when I was a little worst I went as far to bring knives in my room and scratch at my arms With my nails so I could hurt myself in any way I don't even know why I do it i just do. I feel like if i reach out for help ill just embarrass myself like always (I apologize if I spelled something wrong.but if you wanna know noI never actually cut myself I would just tear My art apart in a fit of rage like posters I made or something I drew that I used to be proud of dw I been getting better with the help of laying in bed and scrolling on tiktok till I find a reason to keep on trying and journaling ofc THANKS FOR LISTENING),0

"My mom blames me (18M) for my little brother's behaviour which would be playing games and not going outside much I guess, which wouldn't be true. Anyway I dont spend a lot of time with my little brother because I really cant think of anything to do with him and he also has a different dad so we dont hangout almost ever. I do hangout with my step little brother (has a different mom) and I do enjoy spending time with him because he always asks me out and has something to do. no my little brother does not ask me or anyone out and so we dont do stuff together. I just dont think it is my fault that he acts like he does, he also has adhd and I dont know how that affects his mentality.

 I feel like he might be depressed and one cause would probably be our mother who loses her mind if we dont go do something with her. For example today she asked my lil bro if he would like to go ""frisbeeing or swimming or to fucking hell"". Obviously no one in our family likes to hangout with her because she acts like  she is a good person and all but then just decides to fuck all and ruin everyones day. I have tried to go with the whole family to somewhere like camping but everytime something slightly annoying happens like my brother saying that I dont like this or something along those lines she can't stand it. 

I am depressed bc of her constantly saying negative stuff about me. She told me angrily that ""people at your age are working summer jobs!"" yeah obviously when they have supportive parents and not a crazy single mother. I would like to tell her that but Idk what the conequences would be so I will just try to bear her until I can move somewhere else. And no I dont remember the last time I would have really loved or cared for my mom, I sometimes wish she was dead.",0
"I 20F started antidepressants for around 3-4months and it benefited me a lot. I felt happy and if not happy then extremely at peace‚Ä¶ most of the time.
The downside was I‚Äôd have random nausea every now and then, I gained weight, was often tired, low sex drive (would rarely be able to finish) and even though it helped with my low moods, I have bipolar 2 and i swear it did nothing for my hypomania (not that I‚Äôm sure it was even supposed to help with that).
Having barely any energy and gaining weight started to make me so insecure which was making me unhappy so I stopped them suddenly which I didn‚Äôt know until recently that is not a good idea.
Anyways I‚Äôm losing weight and working out more since I have more energy and not eating as much as I used to (not under eating but no longer over eating) but the bad thoughts are back, I‚Äôm starting to feel unhappy and more anxious again. 
So now I feel like I‚Äôm stuck and can‚Äôt decide what to do:
Option 1: take them and feel mentally stable when I‚Äôm home but anytime I‚Äôm out in public I‚Äôm so insecure because I‚Äôm gaining weight and don‚Äôt have energy to exercise which would make me sad.
Option 2: don‚Äôt take them, risk going back to bad habits to cope but even if I find healthier ways to cope and I lose the weight and feel confident while I‚Äôm out, often when I‚Äôm home I can‚Äôt sleep, I‚Äôm overthinking and crying a lot.

"I worked 40 hours and got paid $8.75/hour.

In her daughter‚Äôs eyes, this woman can do no wrong. 

My girlfriend tells me we have a new job and I don‚Äôt have to worry because we‚Äôll have money from now on. 

Her mom gave her the job. Said she was taking it over and trained her for a month to do so.

So we go clean this huge church with two buildings from 7pm-5am once a week for a month. 

We get the check for $1400 and her mom ‚Äúchanged her mind,‚Äù and she tells me she agreed to give her mom $700. I was pissed af. So I told her if she gave me anything less than $700 I would leave her. So I got $700, she gave her mom $700 and she kept nothing. Her mom took the money knowing her daughter was getting none of it. 

About a month passed and all we‚Äôve been doing is fighting and we‚Äôre not the same. 

I finally gave her $350 bc I don‚Äôt care about the money. So we ended up making $8.75/hour.

Now she and her mom clean the church without me and it‚Äôs made me very depressed and feel alienated. We were both so happy to have something that was ours.

No matter what I say or do she will not see my side and anything I say she says I‚Äôm talking shit about her mom. She said I put a hole in her heart. Idk what to do.

"I guess its over - I have to stop trying. Bc of more than my appearance.

Idk why but someone new said ‚Äúare you poor‚Äù when they saw my place; and I have fillings in my teeth that are dark and no enamel bc of gallbladder attack puking for 4 years.

I have multiple expenses and thats why I dont fix cosmetic things plus I dont think it matters. I have a nice smile and my teeth are not yellow they are white but no enamel.

I have $2700 of damage from an ice sliding accident on my vehicle and more inside. 

I have greys in the top of my head. And I often limp or waddle bc of chronic pain as well as bad sleep making my skin dark under eyes etc.

NONE OF THIS CHANGES FOR OVER A DECADE. Yes I have all the medical care I can but none treat this stuff. They dont cover it and uhh‚Ä¶ 

I cant get around with out my car. 

And Im frustrated that all this stuff make me not allowed to socialize. Everyone rejects me. And just seems to criticise things that just DONT MATTER. None if my teeth are rotting or look like what youre thinking. Oh and always dry lios from the medical and well all my life. I do masks and more it just doesnt change.

How am I supposed to make my life happen when people just reject me for looks or other reasons that are out of my control. All my spending money goes to medical treatment trying to improve myself and these conditions. 

I dont think I can keep fighting it alone. Whats the point if Im treated like a bum when Im not a bum. In my garage in my building and when you try to fill them in or discuss it they just go ‚ÄúI dont remember sayign that‚Äù and it was last time. And you try to address it anyways.

Im sick of ppl. Saying its just a few - nope its everyone for the last 10 years. Everywhere. And I dont know what to do anymore. Its Canada so dont go saying its cheap its over $200 to switch a filling and even then the enameless teeth wont be matching up much and its not the fillings only.

"Can‚Äôt get over his past..

Having trouble letting go of my fiance‚Äôs past.

Hey there, so I met someone online in the year 2021, and we started dating. It was quite serious and was a commitment to get married eventually. The relationship was short lived since he had an all time low in his life by this time. He lost all his finances, his father met with An accident right in front of him home and slipped into a coma and he felt too much for himself and couldn‚Äôt deal with any of it , also because he is autistic I think. He ended up breaking up with me. The same day we broke up, he had a meeting in a different city and since he couldn‚Äôt afford a hotel room ended up staying at a colleagues place. They both were drunk , and she ‚Äúgot all over him‚Äù and they ended up having sex. Now be says he never wanted it, never planned it or such but it just happened and he regretted it deeply right after. And at this point he never thought we would ever speak again. But he could just not let me go for the next 5 months because he somehow thought he could make the money to come to me. But when he realized he couldn‚Äôt at this time and had too much for himself he decided to put a stop to it. Also, he started dating someone in these 5 months to make money off of her and entertained me at the same time. 

Fast forward to a year after , he comes back to my life and we end up meeting for the first time and falling in love all over again. Everything was great for over a year except for some fights here and there. But we were happy. Now we are in long distance for a few months until our marriage and I‚Äôm crippled by his past and what he has put me through. I just can‚Äôt seem to get over it. 

He is a great human being now, he‚Äôs changing so much and developed so much. He has redeemed himself and has come clean about a lot and makes sure I feel safe and secure no matter what.

1- Due to a radical Proctectomy 27 years ago I was made impudent. About a yesr year later my wife left me for a man who is a 5 count felon and just got out of prison. She met him while we were doing a prison ministry. 
2- as a result of the surgery and radiation treatment for that cancer a permanent side effect was chronic diarrhea. 
3- I had a relationship with a lady that had MS. I pay all her bills. Cooked our food and did the household chores. I found out she was having an affair. So that ended in 2000 
4- 4 years ago I had a stroke. Although my family was very supportive I have five kids I chose to live in an assisted living facility. I also have to use a walker. I met a lady my age not realizing she was an avoidant. I went through love bombing till this relationship (?) ended.  Nice thing about assisted-living is almost everybody wears diapers. 
5- this year I lost bladder control. Between being totally incontinent and having to take usually 2 to 3 showers a day just to get clean and wet wipes don‚Äôt work with diarrhea.

The point of this is that I am totally incontinent, impudent, require a walker.

"I've been having depression and anxiety for most of my life and at this point I don't even know what to do to cope. Everytime I've thought I had friends I've discovered months/years later that they were actively harming me. I've only ever had one friend and I don't feel like I can keep being myself around him or I won't have even that, but it also feels like it doesn't matter whether I'm myself or not because we're reaching an age where our life is starting to get a bit more settled and since we don't live anywhere close to each other I can't be a part of his life.

My room is filled with cans and wrappers, my clothes are all over my floor and every time i'm in the same room with my mom, I stop what I was doing and just wait, I feel tense and anxious, then can relax a bit. I just so tired of this.

"Sorry for my bad English! I hope you guys are having great Sunday! 

Ive had anxiety about my future. Im not allowed to be wrong or have mistake on myself. I wanted to be perfect and I ruined the day when I made mistakes. but I could overcome them because my ex bf gave me great energy. He did nothing tbh - just seeing and talking to him, it gave me great energy 

Recently, he broke up with me out of the blues. He has been depressed since January so I suggested him to see therapist and he did but he is prescribed antidepressants since June. After that, he became rude, aggressive - totally different person. He was dream and world to me but he just left me. On March we were on break for 2 weeks and we solved everything well. I was the only one who knew his problem and depression and I was for him when he needed but now there is no one near me. Luckily, my parents understand me but I have no friends 

I‚Äôm worried and scared of everything about my future and myself.  I feel like I can‚Äôt get a job and can‚Äôt find any friends and ppl who love me. And I‚Äôve felt guilty for my ex bf. I just want to escape from this situation. I just miss my happy moments but I‚Äôm sure I can‚Äôt have moments like before. I just hate myself.

"Basically the title. I'm 18 now. Been suicidal all 7 years. I don't even knoq why I'm still here. Pills don't work, therapy doesn't work. I feel incurable. I probably have more going on than just standard depression/anxiety, I've been told I exhibit traits similar to borderline personality disorder. When I was in school I was bullied because somehow kids could sense I was different before I could (I'm transgender). I don't have many friends in real life, most are online and far away. The friends I do have IRL I don't see often, if at all. Only text a few times a year. No one is ever there for me. I've cried out for help so many times and no one will help. I've tried to schedule therapy appointments to see MAYBE if I try again it would work. I get ghosted. And I really don't feel motivated to try to schedule elsewhere. I want to rot in my bed until I just die. It feels like no one cares about me and the state of the country (USA) does not help me at all. I need help. I can't find any. I live my life so disassociated because I don't wanna be here. I used to have a perfect memory, and now I can hardly remember what I had for dinner. I can't bring myself to do things that make me happy (play guitar or photography/editing photos). I feel so lost. ",0
"My entire life, no one has understood me. Not my family, not my friend, not my wife, nor anyone I've been told to seek help from. I cannot accept the world the way it is. It is not simply ""the way the world works"" for me, because ""the way the world works"" is what depresses me. There is a price tag for what one needs to survive, there is a price tag to fix the world's problems, or how much the GDP is of a planet/star system we have never visited. 

I have spent a large majority of my life watching or learning from Fight Club. My father kicked me out to be alone for years, and the cynicism from both my friend and what I learned from Fight Club changed who I am as a person. 

No one can understand why I am so depressed when people have ot worse. The fact that people have it worse than I do is why I am depressed. 

Idk if the words I am using are good enpugh to express what I feel. But I know I am not alone. Please, I need someone... please...

"Life is an utter mess. Got nothing going for me; not even a job, or a friend. Crawling out of this hole feels like the toughest task I've ever faced. I don't think if I even know how to.

I'm quite tired. I can literally feel the absolute mental exhaustion seeping into my body. Imagine those spells in video games that sap your stamina or your life force. It's like I've been living under the influence of something like that for years. Only my tank is empty now.

When I speak to someone, I can sense myself dissociating. I watch myself say dumb or insensitive things and ruin a potential friendship. I try to distract myself with my old hobbies; I feel absolutely nothing. I try to create goals and change my circumstances, but I quickly breakdown when I remember I have nothing to look forward to. 

I have nothing to hold on to either. There's nothing good in my life. Not a single thing. I'm quite surprised myself that I'm still around, and that's not really a good thing. Pain builds on pain. Every passing day is harder to get through than the previous one. 

I'm almost sure that death should solve all these problems for me. I used to say death didn't scare me. But dying does. It's a wholely unfamiliar experience, and I've never had a particularly adventurous spirit. 

Still, it seems the way out. Too late for everything else. I can't make sense of if it. But it's okay. I just need the pain to stop. ",0
"Before I write this, I am not seeking medical advice of any kind, I'm working really well with my doctor and I know my body as well as mind. I'm going to rant more than anything here.

I'm not sure I should keep taking this medicine. The side effects are horrible for me. To be exact I'm on Sertraline 150mg and Hydroxyzine 50mg and Wellbutrin 150mg.
I don't think I should stay on it because it's causing extreme nausea to the point I can't think of food. EXTREME dry mouth. Like I can't get rid of it. My heat tolerance is even worse. I near passed out on a walk and looked stupid. Poor lady and her dog asked if I was okay and stuff and it felt embarrassing. My legs hurt and ache more than usual. My tremors and shaking is worse. I've been on it for about 5 weeks now with no days off of it. 

Bottom line, have you guys experienced this? Any advice? ",0
"# Passive suicide thoughts

Is there anyone out there who struggles with passive suicide thoughts?

English is not my first language but I will try to explain the best that I can. This is not a post asking for sympathy, I'm simply looking for someone out there who struggles with the same thing and has overcome it/ found a way to excist without it taking over their life.

I'm a 25 year old girl, I have a boyfriend and own an apartment, and have a decent job. Still, I feel like my life has no meaning. I feel that life in general is meaningless, and this world is full of hurt, and I don't understand how I can keep on living. I think about dying every single day, yet I'm not strong enough to go through with it. I don't want to hurt the people around me who do not view the world the same way I do, but I can't stop thinking about the relief of simply not excisting anymore.

I feel that I have so much hatred inside of me and so much anger, both towards myself and humanity itself. People are so cruel, both to other people, to animals, and to the planet. I think the world would be a much better place without humans. And I feel so alone with these thougths, and almost like they're ""illegal"", because humans are viewed as on top of the pyramide.

I see now that this post is just a mess, but I really just need to know if there is anyone out there sharing these thoughts, because I feel so alone. I wish there was a ""stop""-button to life, and that I could be able to end it when I wanted without all the dramatics. That there would be a painless way to go, without doing something that hurts. These thoughts have taken over my life, and even though I'm not ""struggling"", because I am able to function in the day-to-day life, I don't understand how much longer I can keep going with this chaos inside my head.

SO is there anyone out there who has been struggling with this and has found something that helped? A way to find meaning in life or just rewire the brain to be happy again? Or are there any motivational speakers/therapists that are known for struggling with this, but has found a way to erase those thoughts? I hope this reaches someone who can maybe share some advice.

Thank you in advance.",0
"everything is pointless. you talk to ppl all day. you lie to them, they lie to you. you know they're lying to you because you're lying to them. you laugh. you come home, you cry (or try to in my case). nowadays when i try to cry i just laugh. laugh and laugh out loud. in the shower, in my room, at work, on the street. wherever. i have to laugh. it all feels like a joke. this is life? can't make an honest living without selling myself out. this is it. a comedy. everyone thinks they have an answer but they're struggling. it'd be best if they kept their mouths shut. i just woke up and I don't know what I'm going to do. it's just so much. i just needed to rant",0

"A few days ago I made a post speaking about my life this year, included there was the fact I was broken up with recently. 

For some context, early into the relationship there was a moment where he expressed how non-attractive I was to him, my skin color/race (I don't believe he's racist, I just think he doesn't find my race's features attractive.), my weight, even my hair, it wasn't at all his type, so despite my best efforts, he wouldn't return any physical affection. I know I should've seen this as a massive red flag and probably ended the relationship there, but I didn't, I was head over heels for him. 

I've never had a great self esteem, I often see myself as lesser, as non-important, as expendable. Post my breakup however, those voices have gotten louder and louder, and now I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror without feeling like a disgusting looking freak, so much so that I've actually teared up from looking at my own reflection, and included in this, I've become starved for physical validation.. to be found attractive by someone else.. I want to be loved and be told I'm not what my head tells me I am, be given the validation my head won't give me and my ex surely didn't.. 

I know that looks are temporary and all but, I can't help but give it a lot of importance, I just want to feel like I'm not going to wind up alone because of how hideous I am..",0

"i'm a 21 year old woman and i grew up with a father who was good provider but he wasn't a good lover or husband and I have always felt an immense amount of empathy for my mother. As i grow older and see her less as a heroic leader and more as a woman who needs love and affection just as anyone else. She deserves so much better than the lack of attention, the talking down on and the rare occasions where's she's been hit. My heart bleeds and my eyes flood with tears whenever i remember this. I was on the phone to a cousin who was like a brother to me and was raised by my father for a few years too and he distanced himself from my father due to unfair treatment because my dad isn't the nicest person sometimes. He accidentally revealed my dad and his friends (who are the fathers of my befriends) cheated on their wives on a holiday trip and this is weighing on my heart massively.

"turned 15 recently.

  
since it hit summer break, everyone's response is always hanging out with friends or playing games all day. I do that as well, starting from June 12th till now(it was fun) but I hate being pulled back to reality and all the things I need to face sooner after I graduate or go to college. I suffered from symptoms of autism, TICS, adhd and had vivid daydreaming as a coping method which keeps me happy and grateful the whole time and stuff like that. Mother always told me that I'm going to end up nowhere happy as her because I played videogames almost every day(I did study as well, but I hate when she yelled at me, told me to revise and told me how addicted I am. I just want to enjoy my three months worth of holidays well after stressful studies of IGCSE and exams.

maybe I couldn't live without my devices, but I just don't want to be reminded of studying for the first couple of months as I need relaxation time.

and I hate when she tells me that I'd end up begging on the streets because I hated reading actual books(I preferred fanfiction, but she despises when I use the internet to read). I don't like when she encourages me even though I already am reading other things, I absolutely despised on how I'd be brought out of my colorful world where I find escapism. Most of all, since I'm in a British school curriculum, I'd be hitting year 11 after august passes. I overthink a lot and I wonder where I'd end up in college/the future, and that thought scares me and brings me desolation since my mother tells me a lot about my life's failure if I continue my 'addiction' right now, but I simply wish to be left alone so I could turn everything all around and such. 

  
everything's just so blurry for me. I've had people give up on me because I hated studying during a period of time, and my past trauma has managed to glue myself to a screen so I could seek hope from my online friends and games or so. It's like taking drugs, but in a safer way. When the adults ask me which college I'd go, I'd be stressed due to my uncertainity and no one likes that feeling too. 

in conclusion, I wished I could've been the better child our family looks upon. Absolutely despised my mother for being mentally abusive, sometimes physically and how she let the whole family down by being jobless and not having a uni degree right now. Wished that I was actually good at maths and better in chemistry, and wished that my mother never expressed how mad she was when she realized that I hated physics. I wish I weren't human sometimes as well.",0

"Hi. I'm struggling at the moment. Let me tell you my story

Up until last summer I was happy. I had never felt lonely or depressed. Since then I moved to another country with my ex. We broke up after about 5 months after moving. I was heart broken then but out of nowhere over very shortly after the breakup. I met another woman and it made me happy again and I was completely honest with her. She knew my situation completely and while I was not able to do everything I wanted due to financial issues of moving to another country while still paying a mortgage back home.  I also have chronic sciatica that is stopping me from being able to enjoy even the most basic of things. I do have surgery coming up to fix the herniated disk so hopefully that will be sorted soon. 

I have gone on a bit of a ramble. Tldr. I am so fucking lonely and I am struggling to make friends. I don't know why it's so hard to make friends since turning 30. I just need some ideas to try make friends that doesnt involve running into another relationship as I don't think I have it in me to be heartbroken again with no friends to speak to. I've been thinking about killing myself daily with almost every other thought. Now I am not going to as honestly the only reason I could think of is that I wouldn't want to upset my family. I have spoken to my family about how I'm feeling but I don't know. They tell me to go out and do stuff. But it's not stopping the dark thoughts I am having. I work most of the week and I do go gym and keep myself busy for the most part. But I do find that while I am doing said things. I am just thinking the whole time that I want to die. I don't know if I am just lonely, depressed or if I am healthy but do just have a shit life and want to die. ",0

"Let me introduce myself I am 15 male, the way I would describe myself is a kind of chubby face with red Rosie cheeks, pointy nose, non refined jawline, very frizzy curly messy hair, with clear glasses. I wouldn‚Äôt  consider myself to be the most handsome person, I try to make myself believe I look good. I‚Äôve had problems my whole life with comments on my looks, I‚Äôve never had a relationship last longer than 2 months, I try my hardest to fit in and I have found friends in my life. But still no matter what I do to change my hair, my clothes my personality anything, I still don‚Äôt feel good in my body. I‚Äôve tried to be myself, I‚Äôve tried to change myself for other people but still to no avail. It‚Äôs so hard being ugly, some don‚Äôt like me just because of the way I look no matter the way I am, or what I do. I have tried substances before nothing crazy just w**d and alcohol. It didn‚Äôt do anything for me, it didn‚Äôt make me feel good or feel any better about myself, so I have since quit doing all of that. I also am addicted to p*rn which is a problem I constantly hate myself for. I‚Äôm am a Christian and want to change for the better it‚Äôs so difficult especially in this day and age. Also I have many people in my life who love me including a mom and dad, grandparents, and many sibling.

"I recently started going to see a therapist after I broke up with my ex of 3 years, we were absolutely perfect for eachother, there was nothing we didn't both like or agree on. We started dating in high school and we were instantly the image of a perfect relationship to everyone we knew, even in our eyes we were. For some back story, as a child I was left to defend for myself since I was roughly 6 and it never got better after that, year after year I would be not only abandoned, but abused, told I was never good enough for anything, and left to fend for myself and my siblings, and as I grew up I got into the mindset that no one can be trusted or relied on, and that the only time someone loves me is when I can be useful too them. I never left that mindset till I met my ex, she showed me that all that was true, but after almost 2 decades of dealing with people who I thought loved and cared about me, just to have them turn once I wasn't useful, it was difficult to believe that for the first time in my life someone loved me unconditionally.
For the first 2 years of our relationship it went amazing, we were the image of an amazing relationship and I knew I found my true love, yet that old feeling came back to my mind and I found myself unintentionally becoming closed off from her and slowly self sabotaging the relationship until one day she left me, and it broke me. I'll never forget that feeling... I dont feel anything anymore. 

So I decided to try to get help, and this was where I had the worst realization. Now I believe that my ex loved me unconditionally, but I realized that I'm more scared of being loved unconditionally then I am of dying alone. Why I'm scared I don't know, I have no explanation of this feeling, I've never met someone who is scared of being loved.",0
"I used to ask for help when I was younger and still believed that people around me, my close friends would hear me out and help me. Now, having been through a lot of rejection and abandonment while being depressed, I don't even seek for help anymore. I just somehow know, deep inside, that no one is going to come to help me, even if I ask. And it is not letting me see the whole picture. Who's really out there for me and who's just along for the ride. The idea of everybody abandoning me stuck so deep inside my mind. Sometimes I wanna break through and ask for help, but the fear of abandonment keeps me away from that idea. Anybody feeling the same? How do you break the vicious circle and finally ask for help?

"It‚Äôs been arguably one of my worst years ever. I caught my fianc√© having a primarily gambling related set of emotional affairs, I was set to get a promotion and it was all a lie, my fianc√© (who we decided to do couple‚Äôs counseling) lost two relatives in the span of two months so we have to put our problems on hold. I‚Äôve had issues with the step-kids not caring for their brother and speaking ill of their mother and I during school to their father and step-mom. My son has been diagnosed on the spectrum and is nearly non verbal. One of our cars broke down and when we got it back it had more lights on it than dodger‚Äôs stadium. And the manager whose position I was supposed to fill as he made a lateral move to a different position has engaged in some strong micromanaging of me and my fianc√© (as we work at the same job regrettably) and more or less bullied me by maliciously following the rules while himself being a hypocrite. Once lectured me for showing up less than half an hour late as ‚Äúnot properly representing management‚Äù and proceeded to be late every day the entire week. I had no issues with him being in the role that was initially set to be given to me, or that he chose to stay despite being offered to move. I loathe his poor treatment of my coworkers as I am a supervisor, and I despise how every shift with him is so draining that it directly affects my home life. 

Our house is in disarray, the lawn struggles to be maintained, im having a war in the kitchen with flies, and I barely replaced a broken garbage disposal that has caused the underside of our sink to warp. The roof has several leaks, our mortgage is barely maintained, my desk and hobby workspace is often filled with other people‚Äôs clutter, and don‚Äôt get me started on my social life. 

I just need to vent. I can‚Äôt catch my breath. And I had to delay both of my therapies for about a month just to save money. And above all, being a man, I don‚Äôt feel like because some of these issues aren‚Äôt that big a deal that people will tell me to just ‚Äúget over it‚Äù and ‚Äúbe the bigger person‚Äù as if I haven‚Äôt always done that. I‚Äôm done. Being that person doesn‚Äôt protect my peace and if this manager looks at me sideways one more time before I find a new job, I‚Äôm just gonna dig my own grave because the things I feel like doing are gonna warrant that I no longer live anyway. Unfortunately for me, these are only feelings and I have no energy to exercise any of it so if push comes to shove, I‚Äôll probably just shut up and quit like always and put on a smile on the way out the door. I don‚Äôt want to live anymore.

My therapist always tells me because I overanalyze everything to just look for what is real and what seems to be real is that nobody really cares that I exist, and I can simply be replaced for anything else within reach. I respect him for trying, but the world around me tries harder.",0

"***TRIGGER WARNING SUICIDAL IDEATIONS***

Why do I wake up every single morning with suicidal ideations? They used to last me almost most of the day and not go away no matter what I tried to do. Now it only seems to be when I wake up and then it seems to digress through the day, it just seems to disappear and then I don't usually have issues anymore for the rest of the day. Some days though, it still would come and stay throughout the day and or go away and then come back later as well.

Then with my sleeping, even if I sleep 7 or 8 hours, I still wake up tired. Most of the time I wake up extremely tired and fatigued like I haven't slept.

I've also tried going to the hospital several times and there's been issues when I've went there (if you would like to know what happened feel free to ask and I'll tell you). I also went inpatient at the mental ward part of the hospital back in February of this year, but I ended up not getting any help in some issues occurred while I was there (if you would like to know what happened, feel free to ask and I'll tell you).

"""Are you okay?"" 
Yeah I'm fine.
My brain screaming ""NO I'M NOT OKAY!!!""
I'm the only one that hears it. 
I haven't been okay in 20 years. I distract myself with people that I deem need me and push hard on that. I attach myself to people that are not okay thinking I will be the one that can help them find the place to be okay. A broken man trying to fix broken things hoping it fixes him.
I'm angry all the time and I push it down so nobody will feel it. I plaster a fake smile on and laugh and joke all the while dieing inside and no one sees. Silence is deafening and the only thing that truly scares me is being alone. I starve for attention while I tell people that I'm an introvert. 
I don't ask for help because I feel I can't more over I feel there will be none. I've have honed the craft of mimicking people in situations to fit in to blend and hide amongst the crowd. For acceptance. When I'm comfortable with a person the see the real me but it could take years for that. I don't trust easily and when I do I give my full heart to that person romantic or not. They have seen me and accept me. But every one leave in time. On thier own accord or death. I am left alone and it hurts and it scares me. I leave situations I can no longer deal with. Because it's easier than putting on a smile taking the assault and feel worse than I did before but if they feel better than that's all that matters. It's not them it's me. 
""You are so smart""
""You are so talented""
""You know so much about everything."" 
""You could be doing so much more.""
""You are so calm all the time""
""Nothing phases you.""
I learn things so I have the answer when someone needs it. I put that to practical use so I can help when someone needs it. If I thought I was good enough I might be able to focus long enough to do more. I have to stay calm or I will explode. 
I get stuck in routine because it is the only sense of normalcy I get in my life. It's the only thing that makes me be able to deal. When the routine is disrupted by outside forces (IE not me disrupting it) I don't deal very well. I develop new routines that become the new standard when it is disrupted in a major way. I'm straight forward and expect people to be the same but my mimicking skills gives me a way to be straight forward without upsetting the other person. Most of the time. My brain works differently I'm not ""Normal"" people expect something that I can never give them no matter how hard I try. I do try. People don't know how to talk to me. Or deal with me. They think they can for awhile but realize that they can't and I'm left alone again. At one point I tried to find the solace in the loneliness and I did for awhile. But it doesn't last never does. I attach myself to people and give my heart because I need that connection. And I so badly want to connect. Nothing is as beautiful in this world than looking into someone's eyes and seeing them and being seen by them. That connection can't break not for me. You showed me something that very few have seen. That is the true beauty in this life a connection with another person on the planet. Another person that has wants and desires and hopes and dreams. When someone leaves the beauty leaves with them. But connection is always there. Because when you find them again they feel it to. Even though I seem disconnected in a moment with a person I'm not. I'm there in the room but my mind is in a thousand places also. What you are saying is connecting with those things also and deeming the meaning of all of it. In the middle of a conversation I might say baby elephants are adorable even though we weren't talking about animals at all. My brain made 200 connection with what you said and baby elephants is where it landed. Now I can never think about baby elephants without thinking about that moment between us.",0
"I somehow manage to have a lot going on yet nothing going on at the same time. I feel trapped in whatever this is. The thing that bothers me the most is the loneliness. I feel as if the only connection that tethers me to this life is my dog. It feels I failed in every aspect of life, if not every then at most the important ones. Maybe it‚Äôs the stress of everything happening right now that‚Äôs making me feel this way but the stress never goes away. There‚Äôs always something. There‚Äôs so much happening that i just don‚Äôt say, I just hate everything man. I hate myself I hate that I‚Äôm existing, i hate how  can‚Äôt keep friends, I hate how I‚Äôll never truly find someone that finds me important to them enough to want around constantly. I feel gross ugly stupid and just annoying to be around. The only thing stopping me from ending things is my lack of knowledge on exactly how to cause a gas leak in my car. I still have a few days left to figure it out because it‚Äôs time again. I‚Äôm tired of hoping for better. I want things to get worse again, I don‚Äôt wanna spend another year trying to find my place here ",0

"This post may sound very dramatic, but it is my true relationship with my condition.

In my early teenage years I had a very bad period and I got depressed. The reason is that during that period I first really realized that albinism would severely limit my life, and since then I've started to experience suicidal thoughts.

I really feel like I'm not understood by anyone when I talk about my disease. I have a severe form of oculus albinism which gives me a 20/100 vision, and a slight form of oculucutanous albinism. I can't even stand at home with windows opened without the sunlight hurting my eyes, and apparently no one seems to take this seriously. I've just stopped talking about this when it happens and just go somewhere else. I also have a lot of difficulties doing simple tasks like using a computer, using a smartphone, reading a book, watching tv and, of course, driving.¬†

I think I will eventually end my life for this. It's something I have thought a lot about in the past, and sometimes I've got really close to doing that. I started to get psychological visits, but that didn't really help. I know that I have to accept it and that there are a lot of the worst genetic diseases out there, but in the real life it seems like everyone has a normal life, and that hurts. It hurts a lot. I can't accept the fact that I will never see the world as it truly is, or that I will never be able to see the sky without sunglasses, and without my eyes that still hurt while I'm wearing them.¬†

You can tell me the things that everyone keeps telling me from years, such as that I have to accept it, that I can still have a healthy life etc. I'm just not normal, and what I'm seeing isn't normal. I'm not even supposed to still be alive and got this far and I will never be like anyone else.",0
"My family is not my comfort zone. It never was. The older I get, the more weight I can feel on my shoulders. My mom has really high expectations of me. Since I was young I would always fight with my mom over everything, even the smallest thing like making a noise while eating. She‚Äòs like a perfectionist and wants me to be like her too. I know she‚Äôs always telling me that it‚Äôs for my own sake but it‚Äôs too much for me to handle. I wasn‚Äôt good at school when I was young, so when my grades came out I always got scolded by her. She said things like, ‚ÄûIs it that hard to be good at school?‚Äú ‚ÄûWhy can‚Äôt you do something that easy?‚Äú Can‚Äôt you be someone I can be proud of at least once?‚Äú She does triggered some traumatic feelings of me. Because of what I went through I grew up with low self esteem and the feeling of being afraid of making mistakes. When we moved to another country I did my best with everything. I got better at school and even graduated from a prestigious university with a good degree. I thought maybe now my mom will be proud of me, but her reaction wasn‚Äôt like what I expected. She never praised me for my achievements and started to criticize me in other ways. She cares A LOT about what other people think about her. So I had to be the perfect daughter she can brag about. The problem was‚Ä¶I was never good enough for her. I don‚Äôt fit the beauty standard and I already know it but getting this told by my own mom always makes me feel hurt. She REALLY CARES A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE‚ÄôS OPINIONS. I always get comments like ‚ÄúWhy are you so fat?‚Äù ‚ÄúDid you gained weight again?‚Äù ‚ÄúI told you not to eat.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never be beautiful if you continue to look this way‚Äù It‚Äôs not only my weight she cares about but also my face. She even had me do a nose job and a lip surgery to look better. I always have to wear Makeup and dress well when I go out. And she‚Äôll always comment on my outfits like ‚Äúwhy are you wearing wide jeans? It makes you look fat‚Äú and even said things like ‚ÄûWhat are you doing? What will other people think of me because of your actions? They‚Äòll think I didn‚Äôt raised you right.‚Äú I‚Äòm so sick of those comments, there were a few times I wanted to end my life. I can‚Äôt be that perfect daughter she expects me to be. And because of that I‚Äòm more fond of my friends than my family. But at the end I got betrayed a few times. Being kind and genuine to others doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll be kind and genuine to you. I never learned from the same mistakes until recently. Reality hit me hard. I feel like I don‚Äôt matter to anyone except they need something from me. I‚Äòm always trying to help or at least be there for the people around me but no one is ever there for me. I do have a few good friends but most of them live in different countries now. Now I‚Äòm at the age where I can earn my own money and treat myself to good things and even travel a lot. I feel like I do it to just escape reality in short term. But after coming back to reality, nothing changed. It was a temporary happiness. I know that therapy might help me but to be honest I don‚Äôt want the be treated. It‚Äôs not exactly like I don‚Äôt want to be healed but I want to leave more. I lost my reason to live. Is it wrong if I can‚Äôt handle all of this and just want to disappear instead of getting treated? Because I tried to cope with it my entire life and I have enough of it. I endured it more than 20 years and now I just can‚Äôt help but feel like maybe it‚Äôs better if I don‚Äôt exist. ",0

"I¬†guess I wanted to make this post because I want to gain some advice or reassurance in my understanding of why I have experienced mental health issues relating to anxiety and depression for the past 7 years (since I was 18, now 25). I want to share a background of my experience with these issues and hopefully gain some insight to how I should move forward, because it has been a constant struggle. Like everyone's mental health experience, it is unique to them and it is extremely complicated, stemming from an array of different things such as childhood trauma, nutrient deficiency,, microbiome health, etc.¬†

Background:

Finishing highschool was definitely the trigger to my first anxiety episode. Navigating what I wanted to do with my life was stressful and I felt as if for the first time in my life, I did not have a clear path. At the time, I didn't even know it was anxiety, but during the year after highschool it was like a flip switched inside of me and hasn't been the same since. Not to say there werent times where I was anxious in childhood, because there definitely was, but this was the first time I really felt the physical and mental effects of suffering from anxiety. This was presented in OCD like behavior with repetitive thought patterns, overthinking, physical tension in chest and stomach (like an urge to cry), insomnia and other symptoms of anxiety. I ended up going straight into full time work and struggled these things regularly but would go days or weeks of not feeling symptoms. It was always irregular and I never knew why I was feeling these things. I have always been healthy and conscious of my diet, sleep, exercise and was never abusing drugs or alcohol so it was a bit of a shock when these symptoms ‚Äúrandomly‚Äù occurred. I was determined to find an underlying biological or physical reason for these feelings and have and still do try supplements, more exercise, eliminating certain foods, regular sleep etc which all help to an extent but have never actually resolved any issues.

These issues persisted and it was shitty but I was able to manage myself and it never really spiraled until I had a bad insomnia episode a couple of years later. This was a combination of the anxiety I had in general which ended up causing anxiety around going to sleep and they just fed off each other. After really struggling for a couple of months I decided to try medication and was given lexapro. Once the lexapro started working, for the first time in ages I felt a sense of normalcy. I was stable, my random anxious thoughts and feelings in my body were gone, I genuinely felt like the best version of myself. My sleep was good again and I stayed on lexapro for about 9 months before deciding I wanted to come off, thinking I had healed my brain of whatever weird neurological misfirings that caused these problems. I hadnt been to therapy at all at this point but I was so determined that I had cured these problems and didn't want to stay on a medication for whatever reason - I think I was ashamed of being on medication and was also scared of staying on them long term.¬†

For almost a year after I stayed off medication and continued to try to heal myself naturally. I had improved with understanding these feelings, I had a better grasp of the causes or what my anxious brain thinks that's wrong with my external environment. I finished my degree and was working full time doing something unrelated to my studies and had decided to move cities and also had just been accepted to a serious full time job. The stresses of these triggered an insomnia episode again and I said fuck it, ill go back on the medication. However, this time the lexapro didn't work and for some reason made me feel depressed. I hadn't really understood what depression was like but now with what I know, its closely related to anxiety. Anyway, I moved cities and although my life improved because I made new friends, was enjoying living out of home, moved to a place I really like, felt less lonely I still had these shitty feelings. I came of the lexapro after trying it for 2 months and decided to get prescribed a different medication. I was determined for this one to work and was put on zoloft. The zoloft killed my anxiety but made me even more depressed. My moods were very up and down. Zoloft didnt work for me either and I decided I really needed to go to therapy instead of using a medication (I know, I should of gone to therapy long before any of this but it was hard as I didnt communicate properly to my parents or friends and wanted to solve the issues on my own.

I went for 10 therapy sessions and learnt a lot of information about myself that I didn't know. I believe the stuff I learnt gave me a clearer perspective of the disorder in a way I hadn't seen it. That is, that it has deep roots in my subconscious brain that stemmed from things that happened in childhood. This was helpful for sure and improved some aspects of it but I was still struggling everyday with these feelings. I weaned myself off the zoloft and stayed off it for a couple of months before ending up going back to the doctor in distress asking for a new medication. I tried Lexapro again for 2 months and it didn't work. I was also going through a lot of stress from a breakup, at this time so I think this may have impacted the efficacy of my third time trying lexapro. The lexapro was making me feel shit so I tried prozac. Again, for two months I stayed on prozac and hated it. This one by far made me feel the worst. I felt like a zombie. That was about 4 months ago. Situationally everything has improved and I am a lot happier with things objectively speaking. They are the best they've ever been but I'm still a mess and have this depression/anxiety that will present itself all the time. I am booked into therapy again which I am excited for. But I don't know what to do. I feel like I have tried everything.¬†

I have read a lot about psilocybin therapy and have used psilocybin many times recreationally but I want to explore a high dose trip alone, and hopefully find some sort of cure to this disease. I understand it's not going to be a quick fix thing but I am losing hope and desperately want to do something to heal myself. I think starting therapy again and doing a big trip will be beneficial. Its fucking annoying that everything in my life is great, yet I will randomly and sporadically get these thoughts and feelings. At the moment it's a lot of depression. I hate how it makes me spiral. I want some advice on whether I should try another medication. I loved the first time I was on it and it worked but i'm afraid of doing the whole trial and error thing and experiencing all the side effects like I did the other times.I want to find something that will work for me and stay on it long term. If you could be bothered reading this whole thing I appreciate it. Let me know your thoughts, ideas, advice.",0
"I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point I hate myself SO much.

I‚Äôm going into college this August and idk if it‚Äôs worth it to go anymore, I feel like I am unworthy of love and I hate myself so much. I‚Äôve never had a relationship and I have no real friends. 

I have a twin sister (I‚Äôm also a girl) and we‚Äôve pretty much had the same friends growing up. Back then I thought it was annoying because I hated being paired up with her but now I feel like a burden to her. I know she thinks I‚Äôm a loser with no friends (true) and she feels obligated to hang out with me bc of our parents. Throughout high school, I hung out with her and her friends and pretty much just faded into the background. Not a single person was actually friends with me because of me- they only hang out with me because of her.

Genuinely (and I‚Äôm not delusional) nobody cares about me; not a single person. I feel worthless and dumb and ugly and unlovable.

I have diagnosed borderline personality disorder along with endometriosis and Autism. With those along with my past trauma, I never really know why im feeling depressed or how to fix it in the moment. I am currently finishing up my bachelors degree and starting work on my Masters in 2025. This summer I have been feeling extreme burn out and just feelings of helplessness. I dont really have friends in my home town so I spend majority of my summer alone in the house. Some days I find myself waking up and not leaving my bed until 6-9 hours of the day have passed. The end of the summer semester is approaching and ive been struggling with school work due to lack of motivation and other things, the guilt from falling behind is also getting to me as well. My boyfriend is amazing, but he has a lot of mental issues as well and its hard for me to open up to him because I know he is fighting his own battles right now and as much as I love him, he has never been as invested as our relationship as I have so I fear that if I start asking for help too much he will decide its for the best for us to split up. So moral of that is, not only have I really found myself struggling recently, I also have nobody to talk to about it. I feel constantly tired and numb. I could write so much more about my familial issues and other things that are bringing me down but I just don‚Äôt have the energy. With my long history of depression every time an episode hits its so hard not to believe this will last forever. I guess my main purpose for this post is just to get support‚Ä¶ to be told this isint permanent.",0

"Hi, I'm majorly depressed and in recovery, just got out of a behavioral facility a week ago. I'm struggling with the basic concepts of caring for myself, like eating and drinking water, but one that I'm struggling with the most is showering. Oddly enough, throughout my years (and I mean years, since I was 11, I'm 21 now), I've never struggled to shower. I've actually loved it. It was a time where I felt I can just, relax and breathe. But now? Now it feels like a place where I am left alone with my thoughts. 

I really want to shower. I took one on Monday, which in the grand scheme of things isn't a long time, but for me it is. I used to shower every other day but thinking about it is giving me an anxiety attack. 

Does anyone have any advice?",0

I remember in school when the hours would drag, now an hour feels like seconds. 

It's also hard because I can't recall what I did a week prior, things just seem to go by so quickly, I have an incredibly busy life with my job and things just pass by constantly without me being able to remember what happened previously.

"A bit of backstory but I went through a very bad stage from May 2022 to roughly March 2023. I was self inflicting, and had several attempts that didn‚Äôt work. I would scream that I wanted to end things when I was having a bad episode. Around Christmas, I told my mum and she helped me sign up to counselling, all was fine and well, I finished counselling around late March early April and I felt so much better, even though it was still brewing and I still have that sudden urge and feeling that I‚Äôll go back to that state.

Ever since then I‚Äôve been very angry, I‚Äôve been crying a lot more, I get irritated and frustrated over every little tiny thing which causes me to lash out at my loved ones. I‚Äôm struggling to figure out why.

How can I deal with my emotions without lashing out? How can I stop myself from feeling this way?

I always end up feeling guilty about it and it makes my family look at me in a way that hurts. ",0

"I am 29m. currently have a couple of friends texting me, asking how I am. I told them I am just not good and they keep asking questions. I am sleeping over 15 hours a day, lost desire to do anything and don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to burden them and don't want to talk or see anyone now or in the near future.

What's a good excuse so they don't feel bad or get worried, while keeping them away? ",0
"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for my whole life. I have gotten significantly better, I am able to manage the illness better and it does not affect me in serious ways. I have support from loved ones and a safety plan in case things were to be bad again, but it has not been the case in several years. 



However, there are times I feel myself slipping into a depressive episode and fall back into my bad habits. Recently, I felt myself slipping into a episode, and I mustered the bit of energy I had to let my loved ones know that I needed some space and time alone. I chose to self isolate. The reason was because I needed time to process the emotions and felt like a burden to my loved ones. During this time, I was not able to think rationally and I was very critical of myself and I felt unworthy, ashamed and exhausted. The urge to self isolate hasn't happened in a long time, but I gave into that urge due to the strong emotions. When I felt a bit better after a few days, I reached out again. 



My loved one told me that he did not like this behaviour, and that if I were to self sabotage again he cannot choose to care about me anymore. 

He told me, a mistake only happens once and choosing to isolate, whether it is inconsistent or not, is a choice. If I get the urge to isolate and I act upon it, and there are times I don‚Äôt want help from my loved ones, then he just can‚Äôt continue to care for me. 

He said I am free to do as I please, withdraw from people, isolate myself. I just cannot expect him to care if I do. 

He said if I cannot allow someone who cares about me to help shoulder the burden of my pain and suffering, then his mental energy is better spent elsewhere.

What he said is completely valid. However, I think of this situation differently.



I think that life is very unpredictable and people will experience a lot of grief and a lot of pain that can make you lose sight of yourself. It can be extremely difficult to reach out for support when the illness is convincing you that you're unworthy. I don't know what will happen in the future, I know that I will probably make the same mistakes again and choose to self isolate. But I also know that during this time, I need my loved ones there for me no matter what. I need people to be there for me when I feel unworthy of love, ESPECIALLY when I feel unworthy of love. The more warmth I am shown, the more strength I will have to get out of the muck. It's a battle with the illness. It's not that I don't want support, it's that I believe I am unworthy of support. I constantly try to fight the negative thoughts that occur when I feel this way, somedays, it's too much for me and I give in and believe them. 



Now, I am very upset. I am sad because someone who I love very much and loves me very much said that to me. I have to accept that I will probably make the same mistake again, because I'm on the road to recovery, and I have to accept that if I do, he won't be there for me. 



Please let me know what you think of this situation, I am looking for advice and support, and different perspectives. Thank you.",0

"Idk if this is the right place to share this, but I think it might be the only place. 

This happened around 20+ years ago now,  back when I was in my first or second year of high school. I was getting bullied every single day, had no friends, nobody to talk to about it, and was an absolute ball of emotions.    
Most of the time I was just pure rage, because how the hell could the teachers turn a blind eye, when the bullies weren't even being subtle? So many kids bullied me, that the teachers just made the mathematical decision that it was better to ignore one child, than punish 5+, and ruin their education. 

So one day, I was at my lowest, and decided to end it all. The issue was, I hated the pain of being cut, drowning wouldn't work because I kept coming up for air, and I couldn't tie any knots. 

So I decided to use my own school tie.... This is when it gets funny.

I had one of those closets that's built into the wall, with a shelf and a bar for hanging clothes hangers...so my absolute dumbo brain, decided to put my tie through the bar, hold onto the other end of the tie with both hands.... And lift my legs off the ground.... Like a god damn looney tunes character. 

I only dangled for a few seconds, before I lost my grip and came crashing down with an almighty thud. 

It was at that point, that I realised how unbelievably dumb what I tried to do was. Not because I wanted to live, or because it didn't make sense to punish myself for other people's actions. Only because the way I tried, was so cartoon levels of dumb. So I'm just lay on the ground, my school tie messed up laughing my ass off. 


Sadly when I went downstairs, and tried to casually tell my mom that I had just tried to hang myself, the timing could not of been worse. She was right in the middle of watching a talk show about depressed kids who had tried to kill themselves. So when I told her what I had just done she yelled at me for making it up, saying that the kids on TV had genuine problems, and I was grounded and sent back to my room. 


It wasn't till over a decade later that I told her what I had tried to do, and reminded her of how she had yelled at me. Honestly I think even a decade later from telling her, she still hasn't forgiven herself.

But for me, it's weirdly one of my funniest memories. The time I tried to off myself like a god damn looney tunes character. Like I was gonna pass out, yet somehow keep holding the tie. 

I still have depression, though it's hard to tell some days, due to all the genuinely legitimate reasons we all have to be sad, and not want to get out of bed in the morning (like if my life was great and I felt this way, then it would be obvious it's depression, but even people without depression would agree that life sucks right now) but I never tried to kill myself ever again, thanks to how dumb I felt when I did try.

"I (23f) am in a major depressive episode due to a shitty life situation and also because I‚Äôve had depression on and off since I was 10. My usual SSRI (Paxil), which I‚Äôve taken for nearly 10 years isn‚Äôt helping at all anymore. I‚Äôve tried Wellbutrin, which I hated because it made me tired for some reason and I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable taking something that could cause weight loss (literally was 93 pounds at the time he prescribed it so no idea why he thought that was a good idea). Mirtazapine, which is way too sedating even at a high dose (we‚Äôre talking sleeping 17 hours). Mirtazapine didn‚Äôt have any positive effects on my mood and honestly made me feel worse. But it got me to a normal weight so I at least feel better about my body.

My depression puts me in a perpetual state of exhaustion, but it makes it hard to fall asleep at night. Once I‚Äôm asleep, I easily sleep 8+ hours and it‚Äôs hard to get up. Apparently my psychiatrist only heard ‚Äúcan‚Äôt fall asleep‚Äù and prescribed Lunesta. I cancelled the prescription immediately once I found out what it was.

"My partner has been on vacation for two weeks and recently returned. When he was gone, I had a depressive episode (honestly, not my worst one, but still), and long story short, it led to us almost breaking up over the phone.

Essentially just saying that having a depressive partner would be too ""difficult/hard"" for him to deal with, even though he hasn't made a huge attempt to cater to me personally. This is the first time he's seen me like this.

A lot happened in between, but I ended up basically saying that we aren't breaking up until we (he) try. But now, especially after summarizing it, Im wondering if I should've just let him leave.

I don't feel as secure as I used to, as sure of his love for me, and I'm worried about things progressing because I don't want to be a year in, having poured so much into the relationship, and he leaves because things get hard. 

Some context: His mother also has depression and is a lot more volatile with it than I am. Same with past girlfriends. About 3-4 days ago, she asked him to help kill herself. His trip has also been overstimulating (his words) and not as pleasant as he wanted. Yes, I'm in the process of getting help; I need money to pay for therapy and to see a psychiatrist, but that's my number one priority. I don't expect him to sacrifice everything to try and fix me, but as my partner, I do expect him to be there for me and ride out the storm with me. It's only been about 4 months, so I didn't expect him to know all my ins and outs, but I did expect him to stay and try, and if I hadn't stepped in, I feel he wouldn't have. 

I also want to note that he has been an absolutely amazing boyfriend prior to this (opens every door for me, pays for almost everything, always compliments me, good morning texts, the list goes on) so this really through me. It feels like we should just call it quits but I'm wondering if there's any possible alternative.

TLDR: Me and my boyfriend almost broke up because my depression is too much for him to ""deal"" with. ",0
"Hi, im just now deciding I wanna do everything I can to get out of this depression and heavy drug use. What are some ways I can dig myself out of this and get to live a happy life. I‚Äôm quitting all drugs as of now I already have 120 days clean from meth. Thank you sorry for the jumbled post imma mess üò≠",0
"I am ugly, worthless, stupid, and don't deserve anything. I am a 14 year old girl, and I know the people who care enough to reply will be all like ""no, you have your whole life ahead of you"" well guess what, I don't have enough patience for that. My parents are so mean to me and make fun of my eating disorder. They call me fat, crazy hurtful nicknames, they are extremely strict, they call me ugly, and get mad at my grades despite me working so hard (I got 90's in all my grade 9 subjects but my mom hit me for it). I have one sibling who is my older brother, and he is no better, heck, even worse. My entire family hates me so much, and I'm clearly not the favorite child. My mom keeps coddling my older brother whenever he eats in front of me to make me feel bad and to make me ""eat more"" because she hopes I get jealous when seeing it. But every time I ate out of sadness because my mom loved him more, nobody cared. I didn't get the same treatment. I got treated worse and got called fat. I hope my anorexia eventually takes me with it. Nobody will even notice if I disappear. WHO will care for an ugly, unloved, friendless, insecure, shy girl like me. I hate myself, I hate my parents, I hate everyone,  hate the world, I wish God can just take me away from this ""test"". No matter what I do, it always ends in people gossiping about me in school, my parents insulting me, my brother laughing at me, and my self-esteem skyrocketing downhill. I'm just posting this as a rant and I'm sorry if it seems annoying but I hope there's someone out there I can relate to so I know I'm not alone, which would mean I am not worthless. ",0
"This past year has been one of the worst of my life. I lost my job last October based on a false allegation from at work. I have not been able to find another job yet. I have lost my apartment, and my car. I have no friends and just cannot think of any reason to stick around anymore. I have no one in my life at all. I am very ugly so no one will ever like me.  Every day it seems something else goes wrong and life gets worse every single day. There will never be any light at the end of the tunnel, I am 54 now and just think I will never get my life back on track. So I should just end it now, right?",0
"This year has been absolutely awful. I got a divorce from an alcoholic who I was with for over 10 years, I was in the hospital for pneumonia, work has been incredibly demanding, my son doesn‚Äôt want to stay with me because ‚Äúdaddy‚Äôs house is bigger‚Äù and literally cries when I pick him up from daycare, my dog is a goddamn disaster - fighting with my kid, going bathroom in the house, my family is awful,I have no friends, I just got power after 3 days because of the hurricane that hit Houston. I‚Äôve been taking care of my son because it was my custody day and now I have to keep him longer because his dad doesn‚Äôt have power. I never in my life thought I would get tired of hearing ‚Äúmama‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù but I‚Äôm just so done. üò´

I just needed to get that out. I have no family or friends to turn to, I‚Äôm so alone. 

I am in therapy but it‚Äôs a process and not one that seems to be going quick enough. ",0
"It's literally the only thing I ever do anymore. I feel like I always have to be at someone else's beck and call and I've stopped thinking about that might drive me to keep living. I don't find time and energy for hobbies, and even on the rare occasions when I can try something I inevitably fail or don't try in the first place.

I no longer have any friends and my family doesn't know if these thoughts, as I hide them pretty well after 15+ years of practice, so I'm all alone... And frankly speaking I deserve nothing more. Happiness is a privilege that a thing as selfish, useless and disappointing as me does not deserve.

I've been to therapists and on medication but nothing works. It feels as if depression has become my default state, so ingrained in my personality that I can't see myself existing without it.

I was supposed to die 5 years ago now and I'm just living past my expiration date to avoid the pain I would cause to my relatives.

This isn't really a call for help as much as an outlet to help me cry and replenish my indifference shield, so don't feel bad about skipping this. I am already dead in everything but body.",0
"Recently it feels like everything in my life is going wrong. I have always been overweight and last year I lost 10kg and started the gym and was feeling great but recently after constant comments from others about my weight it‚Äôs making me anxious about how I am perceived, the last 6 months I have slowly lost interest in everything and don‚Äôt know who I am anymore. I have no attention span, disordered eating and I despise myself. All I do is binge eat and cry. I don‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore and I feel so stuck. I‚Äôm just sick of fighting with myself everyday. I see a therapist, I exercise I do everything right and I‚Äôm still wrong. A friend suggested I was depressed and I went to the doctor and I got given citalopram but I took it for a few days and stopped. I don‚Äôt want to be depressed, I don‚Äôt want to take medication forever. I just want to be normal and happy and everyday it‚Äôs just getting worse. I don‚Äôt know what to do I feel like I am crazy sometimes because I am so overwhelmed with how I feel.",0
I constantly lie to people and family members that i feel great but in reality i feel worse with each day. I constantly think about suicide. I want to die but I can't i am working at this time. My plan was to die this summer but it changed to autumn or winter. I smoke and it doesn't help to relieve the pain i feel. I want to die and i feel that if i disappear no one would notice.,0
I'm just tired of life. That's it. You don't have to reply or anything I don't even know if I qualify as depressed I'm literally just 15 yo but I just wanted to get that out of me. I'm tired of life.,0
"Everyone just leaves in the end without fail. No one has ever really liked me, my best friend of over 10 years stopped talking to me for no reason, I tried to arrange a day out with another ‚Äúfriend‚Äù recently and they just left me on delivered for days so it never happened. I‚Äôve had friends before but I was always the last choice, the one who was walking behind everyone, the one no one really cares if they‚Äôre there or not. No one comes by to visit, no one calls, no one asks me how I‚Äôm doing, no one cares. There‚Äôs something about me people just don‚Äôt like, something so deeply imbedded into me. It has to be a me problem because it‚Äôs such a strong trend in my life. 

I don‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore, nothing feels good, video games are boring to me now. I don‚Äôt have any hobbies, I don‚Äôt have anyone to go out with, I just sit in my room and bed rot. 
Nothing is enjoyable. I either feel empty or my emotions smother me. I mainly just feel angry or sad and it‚Äôs just too much, I feel too weak to experience my emotions. There is nothing for me in this life, everyday that goes by I just get increasingly more frustrated at life, more nihilistic, more misanthropic. I don‚Äôt want to be like this but I can‚Äôt escape my mind. 

I‚Äôm so so jealous of those who have relatively ‚Äúnormal‚Äù lives. Friends, not poor, good mental health. Why not me? I wish I had just ended it all those years ago, I really fucking wish I did. I could have prevented so much horrible experiences, feelings. Fuck this shit. ",0
"20M, been lonely for most of my life, just rewatched those old funny youtube videos cause feeling lonely, still laughed but it wasn't the same anymore.

I disgusted the idea that I'm having fun, I cursed at myself for being happy. I realized, the child inside me is dead after all those years of chasing after people, seeking their attention and approval.

I don't even know who am I anymore.

I've been lonely pretty much my whole life, I always tries to start and initiate conversation, I always helps people without asking anything in return cause I just wants to be their friend.

But why am I always the last choice? They only talk to me when they need something, they only ask me out because all their friends are busy, when I talk my words mean nothing and ignored or cut mid sentence,  
if I don't text them first, they will probably forget that I ever exist.

I really wanted to die but reading other thread about how my death gonna hurt my family, I don't want that.

I feel stuck. At this point, I just want to focus all the time I have left on this earth into my career and money, cause atleast I will still have some purpose to continue.

It's so tiring trying to keep going. I can't understand anything in life anymore.

Edit: Please forgive my horrible grammar.",0

"I struggled with depression as a teenager and was able to build up a life and move myself out of that mindset with some usual tactics, keeping busy, setting goals, exercise, etc. Almost two months ago I had laser eye surgery which has rendered me unable to work or drive.

I‚Äôm really struggling to cope, I just want everything to end. I have constant discomfort in my eyes, I have 20/15 vision but can barely see, I have to take medication for constant pain, I can‚Äôt even open a window because the outside light is too bright. I have doctors working with me but it‚Äôs been over a month with not very much improvement. I was working on my masters thesis which will likely be delayed, I‚Äôm almost broke because I can‚Äôt work, I sit inside all day struggling to use a computer that hurts me half the time because the screens are too bright even on the minimum brightness setting. I feel like I will end up on disability and I can‚Äôt handle that. I can‚Äôt be a burden on society, I can‚Äôt have nothing.

One dumb decision that everybody else will tell you is the greatest decision they ever made and your life is fucked. The clinic will tell you that you‚Äôll be up and driving in 7 days. Your independent optometrist can tell you that you‚Äôre an ideal candidate. Fucked. My life is at a minimum delayed and going to be very hard for a year. At worst I am disabled and unable to function for the rest of my life. I don‚Äôt know how to cope, it gets harder every day.",0
"So an incident at work led to me having a MDD episode. I was off work for 4 months until my claim got approved and got into a treatment program. The program was great. I had a counsellor and a kin. I was doing great. But the depression didn‚Äôt go away. Next week is my last week of recovery. I cut myself four days ago after years of not cutting. Suicidal thoughts are back. I don‚Äôt know. I feel like since I was 8, I‚Äôve always felt like I‚Äôm meant to go crazy. That I‚Äôm meant to end my life.

I‚Äôm not sure. I‚Äôm trying to get back into the workforce and had a couple of interviews. It‚Äôs very competitive out there. I feel like especially living in Canada as an immigrant of 10years, I haven‚Äôt felt like I belong anywhere. Am I not doing everyone a favour for killing myself? Since one less person to compete against for resources?

I‚Äôve already thought off hanging myself. Maybe hinging a hook on the ceiling and getting a rope? I don‚Äôt want my boyfriend to see tho. I just want to stop feeling soooo sad and so so so lonely. 

Thanks for reading. Hope you‚Äôre being kind to yourself. ‚ù§Ô∏è

"I've suffered from depression since I was a kid and I'm now in my 40's. I had been doing better lately...working steadily, going out and doing things with friends, making plans for the future...small steps but moving in the right direction. But yesterday, I just started feeling horrible. I'm single and lonely and feeling like nothing I do will change my life for the better. I went to work and I had to keep stopping what I was doing and run to the bathroom to cry. I ended up playing it off as allergies and went home early. I know I should go to work today but I still can't stop crying. One part of me is terrified of going in and embarrassing myself by crying in front of everyone but the other part says I'm ridiculous for not being able to control myself for one shift. I feel like a loser. I guess I'm just looking for some reassurance that I will be ok and that it's alright to call in and I'm not a loser.",0
"my sister is 29 atm, I'm 23m. Diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and OCD when she was around 24-25, she has improved somewhat but used to fight with our parents, scream, break things, and verbally abuse us. She has expressed thoughts to end her life. In college, she had friends but cut off close ones after disagreements. Post-college, despite my dad investing in an office for her, she didn‚Äôt work and remains jobless with a disrupted sleep routine.

Frequent fights arose because she opposed my opinions, even when others agreed. My parents now stay silent to avoid conflict. I moved to another floor with my grandmother to reduce fights, but she still feels disrespected by me. She demands respect and acts like a second mom, complicating our sibling relationship. My parents have apologized for her childhood, but her inactivity seems to cause her to focus on past grievances.

She's seen many therapists, but only a few helped temporarily. She stops attending if faced with reality checks. She practices Reiki and other healing but behaves oppositely during arguments. I want to help but fear triggering more conflicts. Counselors suggest regular therapy, but she doesn't go. if we tell her a second time she starts to fight. We need advice on helping her improve her life without causing more conflicts.

"Im 21 and i have crohns disease. And i been doing the same exam few times repeatedly for almost five years now. My friends are going to college but im still doing ALevels. 

Because of that i dont have friends and i only talk to two of my best friends. I talk to my siblings over phone but me and my parents are the only people in the house atm. 

I know i have to study but i just cant man. I just wanna leave this shit and all i want is peace. I cant do this anymore.  I hate my life. I feel like a failure. I failed to get into college twice. Its my 3rd and last attempt. Im sure i can get into a college cuz i been working hard. But whats wrong with me.  I just cant do it.  

My crohns symptoms are bad now. My tummy hurt a lot sometimes. I just hug a pillow and try to bare the pain. I know there is a direct connection between gut and mental health.  My gut is messed up because of crohns. 

I started zoloft without talking to a doctor cuz they gave me a appointment date 2 weeks from now.  I just cant handle 2 weeks. My tummy starting to hurt so bad, idk if its because of zoloft side effects or crohns. 

I just wanna end this pain. All i want is to be nude in the nature, maybe sun bath, maybe get a hot bath in a bath tub.  Idk anything to escape from this life.  

I cant do those either cuz my exams are in 4 months....

Plz what do i do???",0
"I recently tried to kill myself but ended up in the hospital, won‚Äôt really go into the details cuz i don‚Äôt want to be identified but you can ask questions if you want. 

However after the incident, I felt so embarrassed of what happened and am trying to convince myself that I‚Äôm not depressed anymore. Does this work? Before the incident, I had convinced myself that I‚Äôll forever be depressed and I felt comfortable being depressed. I‚Äôm now beginning to find depression as kind of l*me.

"Laying on my bunk in the Brevard County jail the man in the bunk next to me started eating chips. I could hear him munching on them as I lay there trying to sleep. He starts laughing to himself quietly as he's doing this, and while I hear this happening, a strange feeling starts to overcome my body as it seems to slowly go from my ear towards the lower half of my body jewels.

It was at this time I started to have intrusive thoughts about offensive things that disturb and anger me. I'm not sure if this was some kind of ritual or what, but it seemed like some dark magic was being performed at that time. I was confused as I didn't know things like this were possible, I just lay there not confronting the man.

It has been 10 years since that happened (around 8/14/2014 - 9/15/2014) and it is still ongoing. This phenomena is truly ruining my life and I'm not sure how to proceed. This happened in Florida.

"I‚Äôm 17 and feel like I‚Äôve got no point to living other than upsetting people around me, I don‚Äôt necessarily want to kill myself but I hate feeling like this. I‚Äôve sought professional help and tried many things but feel the same, I could be happy throughout the day but at the end it‚Äôs always the same. I‚Äôve gone through my first breakup recently and I was feeling fine before hand, I put everything into the relationship so idk. I can clarify or explain more",0
"Hi, idk how to intro this but oh well. 
Let me be clear I‚Äôm not looking for any sympathy, trust me when I say that I messed up my life it was no one else so sympathy will get me no where, to be fair I just don‚Äôt have anyone in my life who‚Äôs actually willing to listen to me so here we are.

Firstly let me start out by saying that I am a Christian, have been for my whole life. For those that are still here thank you. Now that we‚Äôve ripped that bandage off where to really start. 
I guess I could start with the fact that I am alone, totally alone. I have people, just not people who want to pour into me without getting a lot more in return. As it stands I can‚Äôt remember the last time I actually opened up about how sick I feel, not physically but mentally. 

I have 1 friend she‚Äôs really awesome, she‚Äôs my best friend, I love her to death but her parents hate me. They think I‚Äôm turning their daughter into a lesbian and we only really get to hang out for 1-2 hrs at a time every other week and since I started going to another church I barely see her anymore. I miss her a lot but she has her own issues and I know I have no right to be selfish, her issues are far worse then mine trust me I know that beyond a shadow of a doubt but sometimes it feels like we never really talk about my life. I‚Äôve told her some stuff about me and to be fair she has sat with me when I cried on the phone with her but whenever we talk now she‚Äôs always complaining about her job and her family because they suck. I love her to death but sometimes I just let the phone ring until I feel bad enough to call her back because I don‚Äôt want to continue to hear about her problems when I feel like I‚Äôm suffocating from the inside out. I love her, I really do please believe me that I would die for this girl and I want her to be my maid of honor one day but I wish I could just talk to her about me, and she wouldn‚Äôt just shrug it off and then move onto her own issues. I need help and she‚Äôs my only friend but it feels like she doesn‚Äôt want to listen to me because she doesn‚Äôt know how to handle it when I have stuck my neck out for her a million times. I was there for her when her grandfather died and her dog got hit by a train, and I did her hair for her graduation twice and I have always always done my best to be there when she needed me. Not to mention due to her parents abhorrence of me we can‚Äôt ever see each other anymore and talking on the phone will never replace being with her in person. I know it sounds selfish but I‚Äôm not trying to be. With her parents hating me and causing her life to suck i feel like i can‚Äôt help anyways but i care for her so much i just want to get her out of the situation she‚Äôs in but I‚Äôm also suffering so I can‚Äôt really help her.

As I mentioned I stopped going to the church she went to. I left for a multitude of reasons, that church ruined my life although in the situation I wouldn‚Äôt blame them. My parents were both pretty prominent figures in that church before their reputation was smashed into the ground because of me, granted I was a child but If I hadn‚Äôt made the choice i made maybe I would‚Äôve had a better life, it all stems from that place god if i could go back and tear that girl a new one i would but I can‚Äôt so whatever. Anyways all that crap happened, really traumatic stuff but that‚Äôs not what is happening presently it‚Äôs just to set up back story.
Presently i attend church with my parents but just a few months ago i was attending that other church. I liked it for a while, i met my friend there and we had a few fun trips and stuff but because of the incident i never had any other friends really. I had one other that was friends with me and my bsf but she ended up turning on us, it hurt my bsf more then me tbh but I caused that too, i started some stupid fight and the girl never really talked to us again. I had another friend but it turns out she was just using me to find out more about my life and the crap 10 years ago so she could feed it to the church gossip strip so i broke it off with her. Then i just had me and my bsf which was ok although i never saw her because she was working or just not going to church. I was alone, so i tried therapy with the pastor. At about that time my bsf stopped attending because of family stuff and i had a breakdown in the parking lot on new years, it was bad. I only went to a few sessions before i gave up on trying because it seemed like there was no help for someone like me.
I have been going to this new church (not new I‚Äôve attended before but i was mentally unwell and still am) and it seems to be ok for now but I don‚Äôt really trust anyone, it was the same at the last church, i had no one, or i was shouldering everyone else as a burden. I‚Äôm just tired not physically but mentally , i have been for a loooooooooong time but when i tell anyone that they don‚Äôt get it at all. 

Another thing, I‚Äôve graduated high school, it should be exciting but it‚Äôs not. (This is the part where i messed up my own life, pls do not feel bad for me about this particular thing lol) I‚Äôm a fraud so to speak, i attended regular school up till the beginning of highschool when I started to do homeschool. I got ok grades at the regular school and when i started to do homeschool i guess my parents just kinda thought i was cool to just do it by myself, not sure but i was given a laptop and cds to do and for the first year it was ok, i occasionally cheated but nothing serious, just looking up the really difficult questions on my phone or whatever. It was when i got to the end of 8th grade where i found the grade books my mom hid. I took them of course (stupid teenage brain riddled with depression) anyways i cheated my way through the rest of the grades like big time, I wasn‚Äôt learning anything at all. It was easy really, my parents took their hands off my education because they were busy with work and again i was alone. My dad had big dreams for me, still does, but i can only remember one time where he actually helped me do my school work and that was when i was still in regular school, but when i was homeschooled all he wanted was my report card. Good grades means good daughter i guess lol. Anyways i screwed up obviously. I graduated but i knew nothing and by the time i was in 11th grade i realized this but I couldn‚Äôt do anything but keep cheating to pass the grade so daddy dearest didn‚Äôt think anything weird. At some point my mom found out but she never told my dad and instead just helped me cheat by giving me the books (maybe she felt like i was just using them to grade myself or that she just couldn‚Äôt tell my dad because he is an angry individual anyways, he might just kill me if he found out lol.) 
I remember one time where i was in my room with headphones on ‚Äústudying‚Äù and my mom tried knocking but she couldn‚Äôt get my attention so she came in and we smoothed it out but i guess my dad heard my mom knocking and decided to come to my room, slam the door open, yell at me as i cried and then pulled on the handle with his foot at the bottom of the door pulling the handle so much its still loose to this day. He asked me about it once and i told him the truth but he just said he didn‚Äôt remember. So anyways safe to say i have no one i can beg to help me with this and if i did i fear society would kill me to lol. Like i said don‚Äôt feel bad for me this is my own fault. 
He scares me, he can be happy one minute and the next he can snap at me or my mom like a rabid dog, i begged him to help me with my resume a million times since he was a supervisor at a medical facility but he just told me to do it and he‚Äôd look over it but he never did, so i just did it myself and nobody wants to hire me which is making him upset with me lol, he asks everyday if i found another job and that i should go to the places and stuff but I don‚Äôt want to even listen to him since he can‚Äôt take a second to just be a dad, i think he doesn‚Äôt want to be my dad. I don‚Äôt know why, or what i did maybe i remind him. Of himself with all my mental issues but i just wish i had someone to show me what to do now. Tbh i think my only solution is to take a bunch of pills and forget about this haha. Just end it all while i have some dignity left. No money, no friends, no life, I‚Äôm just so alone and there‚Äôs no magic solution so guess what, ill just return to my fathers throne, end it all , all the pain and hurt i inflicted upon myself then my dad can miss me when I‚Äôm gone. 

Anyways thanks for listening to my ramble and please don‚Äôt feel bad for me i did this to myself.
Hope you guys have a good day :)",0

"i‚Äôm only 18, and yet i feel like i don‚Äôt have much more life yet to live. everyday is such a battle. my body is a mess of scars, i can‚Äôt seem to eat anything without feeling guilty, and overall i feel like such a burden. i don‚Äôt want to die because i don‚Äôt want my family to have to deal with the aftermath, but there‚Äôs no way i can keep living like this. i want to move far away and try to start again but i don‚Äôt have the money for it right now. 

i‚Äôve never been in a relationship and can‚Äôt ever picture myself in one. i want one more than anything, but i don‚Äôt think anyone could ever actually want me so i‚Äôm trying to accept it‚Äôll never happen. i‚Äôm just tired of constantly fighting this battle with myself. i want to just give up, maybe throw myself into the mountains and just wait for someone to find me. maybe run away and leave my phone and belongings at home. idk anymore :(",0
"been struggling with these thoughts for so long and after trying yet another antidepressant i think im ready to call it quits. i have nothing going for me, no friends, no one that cares about me. that‚Äôs not even adressing all of the shit that‚Äôs wrong with me and i just can‚Äôt do it anymore. i‚Äôm sorry and goodbye ",0
"I swear,  nothing will make me feel anything at this point. I feel like I'm just draining everyone around me; like I'm ruining everyone else's time. I have become Tweak from South Park; just quieter because I'm terrified of being loud and noticed.

I am weeks away from turning 27 and I have done nothing in my life to show for it. I have no friends, I have no job because there is literally nothing I can see myself doing that won't mentally exhaust or siphon the life out of me. I have had like 9 jobs and every single one made me want to die. I do have income in the form of Employment Insurance. 

I play video games all day so that my bad thoughts aren't as intense - but I fucking hate every second of it. I get zero pleasure. Victory Royales mean nothing; platinuming a Souls game means nothing... just repetition so my anxious thoughts don't get too out of whack.

And before you suggest ""getting out,"" my front entrance is everyone else's backyards. I live in a basement apartment and I have a douchey neighbour above me and crackhead tough guys next door. All eyes are on me and fucking hate it. No matter what, somebody is always outside and I can't fund nowhere else to live because there is a housing crisis where I currently am. Especially now that scumbag homeowners discovered Airbnb and that they can make more money nightly than renting to someone monthly. 

My parents got me tickets for a Billy Talent concert so that I can maybe feel something... and nothing. Everyone is literally doing everything to make me smile and I feel so disgusting and guilty for not being able to just smile for them.

I want out. This isn't fun anymore. I literally am at a point that I'm trying to re-home my bunny because I cannot be there for him mentally and he's just in his enclosure all the time and I just panic now when I let him out. He doesn't deserve this and I can't even find someone that will give him the life I can't provide. I may be in a prison, but this bun doesn't have to be. I often talk to him and say things like ""we're not so different"" because this apartment has become my enclosure.

This post has just been me rambling but again; I want out of this. This miserable fucking existence.",0
"Maybe this sounds strange, but I find it very comforting that when I die, my body will return to the earth and decompose. I‚Äôm not scared of it at all. On the contrary, it seems very peaceful. It brings me satisfaction to know that the nutrients and energy in my body will be used by other organisms who might have a life that makes more sense than mine. 

Does anybody else feel this way?",0
"I have been on antidepressants most of my life. I don't know what ""normal"" is. My therapist recently said she thinks I need to be evaluated more often as apparently most people don't get jealous when they hear someone has died. I thought that was ok. I am not thinking of harming myself or others. Just that death might be the better option. Does anyone else feel like they don't know how to be around people because your thoughts are so much darker? I just don't know.",0
"i really want to kms lmao. i failed to graduate on time and now my mom can barely talk about me with her friends and is ashamed to answer questions about me. my dad had to move to another city to support us. i feel like i‚Äôve disappointed my little sister. 

i‚Äôve always been a sensitive person since i feel every emotion like its a giant whack to the chest. i dont think they understand how i get so riled up over small things for them. im ashamed and apologetic but it‚Äôs so tiring now. i keep thinking of ending things. ",0
"Diagnosed with depression about 5 years ago.  Broke up with gf about 6 months ago, she said I never talked about my feelings.  I said if I talk about my feelings I feel like I'm just feeling sorry for myself.  She said she never said that and she didn't feel that way.  I didn't say she felt that way, I felt that way.  We were discussing a song that came out when I was in college and I said then it gave me hope that anything was possible for my future, now I hear it and it just shows the ""futility of life"".  And I had mentioned how I want to do things but then I don't care and what does it matter.  Are these things that she should have picked up on?  Does anybody else feel that they are just feeling sorry for themselves by talking about your feelings?",0
I suffered a spinal cord injury a couple years back. Now I live with chronic pain and a broken body. I miss being physically active. I was an athlete all my life and It breaks my heart that I can't play my favorite sports anymore and I'm only 27. It was one of my main sources of joy and now my life just feels so incomplete. The loss of my old body is grief I haven't been able to shake. It truly makes me suicidal being a complete shell of my former self and knowing I can't fix my body ,0
"I am reposting from r/breakups because I‚Äôm not even sure how appropriate it was for that sub.

We broke up on Monday after a year of a pretty terrible relationship. Constantly unmet needs and bare minimum requests unmet which triggered a lot of fights and nothing ever being done about it. He called me and told me I made him want to die and told me to fuck off and leave him alone. 

After a year and a half I finally quit my job that was exhausting me and leaving me feeling burnt out, most of the colleagues that I worked with in that time didn‚Äôt really care and some seemingly pointedly didn‚Äôt say goodbye on my last day. 

I don‚Äôt have many friends. Feel pretty insecure and like it‚Äôs difficult to connect with people but hang on to a sliver of hope that most of the time that‚Äôs something we tell ourselves out of insecurity. 

My family doesn‚Äôt ask anything about my life and treats me like a child, sent my mother a picture of my last day at work and she ignored it. Just feel like it would be easier if I was just dead. I feel so alone and like I‚Äôm not worth saving, like there‚Äôs no good part of me to hold on to. And to top it all off because I‚Äôm 26 I feel like I‚Äôm too old to be dealing with these immature/petty things or feelings. Feel like something is very wrong with me. I just want someone to talk to :(",0
Can anybody tell me how to keep going? ,0
"I am 34f

I have not been able to hold onto a single friendship in so long. I really think that people just tolerate me at best.

I see people have extremely close friendships with people who share the same interests, have children around the same age, having a good time together, all that lovely stuff. But for the life of me I cannot hold onto a friendship.

Just to show a little self awareness of my flaws, I feel like I am never consistent as a person and can having changing opinions everyday(like how I feel about a coworker, controversial issues, my approaches to situations) I am very aware that I am all over the place. But I don't have bad intentions. I do my best to consider what would hurt others and what should or should not do/say. Sometimes my honesty is not appreciated, totally understandable. But does that make me so undesirable to be around?

Just as an extended example, I became friends through my work, since I work remote but even they avoid contact with me or keep it at a minimum.

I know that I got upset at each of these friends at one point because they have said something hurtful to me when I just try to barely exist around them. Also, if I have a moment of success I feel like they take it as a threat and make snide comments about how they are struggling with a task they have work as a response. They have had their successes too and I tell them good job let them know that they deserved the praise they get. They complain about their teams and I would listen to them and try to console them or try to give advice but they would ignore me or just would be dismissive in general. 

I even at one point was telling one of those friends that I really missed one of our old coworkers and was getting emotional about it and they said that I shouldn't care since this person didn't give a shit about me... later this person denied ever saying something like this when I brought it up months later.

I won't deny that recently I started saying snide stuff back because I have kinda had enough and just returned the attitude. But now that made it even worse between us.

I don't know what to do anymore but I know I complain about person A with person B and then person B will slowly just not want to talk to me anymore either. Like I have no one to confide it at all. I feel like if someone says/does something I am not allowed to talk about it cause then I am just the ball of negativity and no one wants to be around me. What do I do? I feel like there isn't a single soul out there that gives a shit about me.

Is it me? Like am I just a piece of shit? Am I just so fucking unlikeable?

Edit: To add about the hobbies, I hate competitiveness to my core. It makes me anxious and I don't like feeling that. But whenever I want to share a hobby why do I feel like people want to compete with that hobby? Kinda like my cooking is better than yours, playing games (in a team) but competing to show who is better in skill. I just want to have fun. I don't want to talk about whose is better. Maybe I am just sensitive. But I just want to share a hobby with someone that won't treat it as a competition",0
"I'm just so tired...so tired of getting back up on my feet with words like: ""Things will get better."" ""Just try one more time."" I just feel so exhausted and sad. I don't want to get back up anymore....",0
"Has anyone ever felt at peace when they scroll through depressing shit? Because I do, it‚Äôs embracing your depression like hell yeah I feel that way! And other times it‚Äôs just relaxing to me to go through a video that explains my exact situation.

I used to bawl my eyes out at these kinds of videos cause you know for most people it‚Äôll just make you feel even worse, but I‚Äôve finally found peace in embracing that kind of sadness and in doing so I‚Äôve been beginning to feel less sad.
I‚Äôll do it late at night so when I wake up I won‚Äôt feel that way anymore and it feels pretty refreshing honestly.

Reverse psychology I guess lol.",0
"do you ever think back to a time when you were happy? i do all the fucking time, it hurts so much to exist now

when my mother took care of me and took me everywhere to make me happy

when i had a loving girlfriend who promised me a bright future, a marriage, children, a life worth living and working for

when i was passing school with the highest grades and honors, energy in me to do my best and work to my career

slowly losing everything, watching your life collapse in front of you, and you sit there, with no control, and all you can do is cry

i now take care of my mother who isn‚Äôt as well now with constant medications, cries in front of me, and worsens every year

my girlfriend broke up with me 4 months ago (been together for half a decade) because she couldn‚Äôt do long distance anymore, told me she doesn‚Äôt have enough love for me, and doesn‚Äôt want to see me

and now im barely passing college, failed a class, lost a scholarship, and i don‚Äôt give a fuck about graduating or any career

i lost everything, i have constant nightmares of my girlfriend leaving me, i loved her more than anything in the world and she meant everything to me, she was my hope to a happier life

i‚Äôve been crying everyday for months, often research suicide and read posts on reddit about them, i tried everything to get better (gym, hang out with friends, hobbies, every fucking thing) and nothing works, i feel worse

im afraid of being alone and i know ill have no one left soon, the only reason why im still here is because i dont want to hurt my mother more than she already is if i were to disappear

sometimes i feel like screaming, i hate that i have no control over my life anymore, i cant do anything, all i can do is sit and wait until i lose the last few people i have left

i wish i could just disappear, i dont wanna cry anymore, i dont wanna have tormenting thoughts anymore, i dont want nightmares anymore, i wish i could be happy

i just wanted to vent, i have no one to tell my feelings and thoughts to, i pretend to be okay, i wish i was happy ",0
"I lost my twin brother when we were 7. It‚Äôs been  12 years now! After my sweet brother left this earth, I have had this urge to leave too.

My father used to say that when one twin d!es the other shall follow. I‚Äôm not sure if that is true anymore, but surely he must be right, since I have not truly smiled since I lost him.

 I can‚Äôt explain the type of grief I feel anymore.
Every birthday is a reminder of my loss and I feel guilty. I feel guilty for growing up!

I feel like he would have loved living, he would have loved growing up instead my parents lost their son and got stuck with a bipolar daughter.
Since I look identical to him all these years my mother couldn‚Äôt even look at me without crying.

She used to make me dress into his clothes when she would miss him asking me to tell her that he was okay. I haven‚Äôt existed since I lost him. I didn‚Äôt realise how much he protected me all these years and he even passed away protecting me. I feel guilty for how my mind is! 

If I could, I would change places with him; I want to change places with him. I feel like a ghost that stole another persons‚Äô lifepath.

I had a best friend she was always there for me. She understood me and never made me feel like I needed to be someone else. I loved her existence everything about her was beautiful. I moved away and she passed at 15! 

It‚Äôs been 4 years now. I feel jealous of them, I know how messed up that is but I feel jealous. I miss her!

I have trouble keeping friends now (terrified if I am a curse) and maintaining relationships. I had someone in my life who loved me for me but of course even he got scared when I got into a depressive episode for the first time.

What‚Äôs the point anymore!? I am 19 years old and the thought of having to exist for another decate sounds dreadful enough. 

I love my mother! There is nothing that I want more than to see her smile but I can‚Äôt be here for her anymore. 

Maybe my father was right‚Ä¶ twins really do die together!",0
"I'm 17, from Turkey and I just dont know what will make me happy. I have a roof atop my head, a cozy bed and food and water. If I say I was sad it would be shameful wouldnt it? Millions of people over the world are much poorer than I am, they are in the middle of wars they don't even have anything to do with, many people have shitty parents, live in shitty places, have no friends, are oppressed, yet they still try holding on to life, they still work hard to live and stay alive. They try brushing off their problems and continue their lives.

And we have me, complaining about some bullshit. Do I even have the right to complain? I should be disgusted at myself for even thinking of a possibilty of suicide. How can I do that while there are millions who are in worse conditions than me right? And my parents, they have fed me and took care of me for my whole life and going away without returning anything would be disrespectful to them right? Or is it already their fault for bringing me to this world. Maybe I shouldnt feel indebted to them because they wanted to make another child because of their selfishness and them wanting another kid and nobody asked me my opinion about being born. So they are supposed to take care of me and feed me, because they themselves wanted to make a child so its their duty to do so right? I honestly don't know which one I should feel. I guess my brother wasnt enough for them though, I know that at least.

I have lots of friends, they are all good people, but not even a SINGLE one of them will accept me for who I really am. I don't even know what I am by the way. I am certain of a few things though. I was born into a male body. I know that I like my hair long, and I like having bangs, I like learning about makeup, I like feminine clothing, I know that I hate my masculine body, I hate my body hair, I hate my thick eyebrows that most of my guy friends envy, I hate that I'm as tall as I am, and I know that I feel that something just isn't right. Am I trans? I don't know, maybe I am. But who cares about the labels, I just know that I want to live the way I want to. My friends though? They aren't willing to accept me. No way am I EVER going to open up. Most of my friends are Muslims, even those that aren't, they hate everything related to lgbtq+. I was an hypocrite when one of my closest friends was proudly talking to me about burning a rainbow flag in the street. and I laughed at it. I have no place in the lgbtq+ community because I am not proud about who I am. I can't proudly defend my real thoughts, and I'm supposed to live up to my father and friends' expectations of being some big muscular dominant male or some shit. It's been 13 months since I started going to the gym. I'm stronger than most of those friends. They respect me. But what if they knew that deep down I wanted to keep my hair down, and learn more about makeup? Why do they care even? It's my body isn't it.

Hormone therapy? Maybe hitting up a psychologist? Or a therapist? I don't know how to. I don't know about any of these things. I know that I am not opening up to my parents about any of this. Forget gender, but I am not even saying a single word about having symptoms of clinical depression. I was the hypocrite who laughed and agreed with my father when he proclaimed that depression is some bullshit created by the west to disrupt our progression. I thought my brother was more sane. He says that Turkey is a country bound by its customs and religion. He says that he supports lgbtq+, religious freedom, he says he wants to change how the country is. Yesterday, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. I got tired of hating myself and suddenly losing all joy whenever I looked at my reflection, in the phone, in the mirror, wherever and whatever. I watched some videos, grabbed a scissor, and cut some tall bangs to cover my large forehead and my receding hairline (at this age, I know). I got out of the bathroom, my brother saw me, he started laughing. ""What, u transitioning or something?"" ""You look like a girl, its awful."". Yeah, they are all supportive of modernising or whatever unless it comes to someone they know. My mother is probably like that also. I am not gonna open up to anyone I know, like, ever.

One of my friends saw my hair. He said that he fucking hated it. He said that he would pay for my haircut and he said that he was gonna arrange a barber next week. What about my opinion? You haven't asked me? He said that I hadn't had a relationship ever, and with hair like that, I wouldn't ever get one either. Who cares? I don't cut my hair, I don't look after myself, I don't go to the gym and build a body just to get in some fake relationship that's all about looks. And this guy had long hair for years mind you. Now that a few months ago he was clean shaven, he somehow turned into a guy who hates long hair? ""Friends"" right. I like his company nevertheless. Some other friend saw me. He would oftenly joke about how I would look great in feminine clothing, and that I should ""open an onlyfans"". Hilarious jokes I know, I never found them funny. He hated the hair the most. He angrily said that I should hide that shitty hair. I thought you were with me though? You joked about feminine clothing because of my long hair but if I was to actually wear a skirt, I believe you would get me out of your life and hate me. I sent a friend whom I opened up about these feelings I had a photo. He said I was mentally ill. He assumed that I was ""turned to normal"" after I started hitting the gym. Well, the one dude who I thought would help me throughout this was also turned against me now. Really good being alone. Sure I got friends, but in reality I don't have ANYONE whom I can talk about my real feelings. Oh yea, I also had that one dude. He ""was"" pansexual. He used to help me, but he said that he turned into a Muslim and he was only a pansexual because he was a kid. He was ""normal"" now, he said. He used to preach us about loving everyone because he watched vinland saga (an anime about basically having no enemies). One time we were talking, he said that he was homophobic. I asked, you used to say that you hated no people, and what about gay people then? They can't control who they love or not? He said that he didn't consider them as ""people"" to begin with. So yeah, I am, in fact, alone in reality.

Maybe I should just buzzcut my hair. My hair is the only thing that binds me to my true self I feel like. If I cut my hair, would I forget about the gender dysmorphia and become a true man? Or will the dysmorphia kill me and I would be even more depressed and would hate myself even more? My friends would like me more that's for sure. But it's not worth it. Maybe it is, I don't know. I don't have the balls to take such a leap anyway.

Next year, I'm going to have an exam. That single exam basically singlehandedly decides which college we will be going to in Turkey. All our lives, bound by 1 single exam. I want to be an artist. I aim for graphic design in a good college here. I won't be able to do it though. The stress started hitting me already. I have only a year, so many people are ahead of me. People who go to courses, have lessons about art. I am here with only my self-made talent. I am supposed to work without sleep on art for an exam a year later. I hate it. I really enjoy drawing, but the whole year will be a nightmare. An older friend of mine. He committed suicide because of this exam. The pressure was too much for him. (There's no suicide hotline in Turkey btw, as a side note) My brother took the exam a few years ago. His routine was waking up 6 am, 2 hours of studying, 8 am to 4 pm was school, 4 pm to 8 pm was cram school. 8 pm to 10 pm was studying and he slept after. This was his routine for a WHOLE YEAR. He got into the college he wanted, he also finished grade as the top of the school. I know that I don't have this in me. I can't study this much, even if it's drawing. My father just barely agreed with me after weeks of arguments that he would allow me to go to art school. If I can't get in this year, I'm fucked.

I feel like an entitled brat. I've seen the posts here. People are going through so much worse things than me. I'm an asshole to even have suicidal thoughts right? I tried self harming today. I grabbed some knife, cut through my thigh. It hurt, there was blood. I felt nothing after it. I don't know what I was expecting. Maybe I just gaslit myself into depression? Whatever, I am not doing that again. I don't know what I'm expecting posting this here. If there is a karma limit its all for nothing anyway. If there isn't , I would most likely get a few responses anyway. I know I wouldn't read through this bullshit block of text. Venting feels good sometimes though. I don't know. I don't know what I should do. I have much more to write, but who cares anyway. I don't even care enough to write them down myself. Whatever, even if I don't get replies, it felt good to write this anyway. Lol, my first post got removed without any message or anything already. Thanks reddit.",0

"TL:DR: I think my depression is seen as an inconvenience to husband and I‚Äôm constantly scared he will leave me if I‚Äôm not happy wife facade 

TW: sibling loss, suicide

Me (28F) and my husband (30M) have been married for seven years. A lot happens in that time. Good, bad, ugly. Overall I feel our relationship is straight out of a love story. There‚Äôs always going to be bumps in relationships but we‚Äôve always been able to eventually communicate and fix anything that‚Äôs not quite working 

Well last year, I lost a sibling unexpectedly to suicide. Not sure how many people have experienced grief on top of regular ole depression but suffice it to say it has been rough. A rollercoaster of emotions and everyday being different. I feel we‚Äôve navigated it as best we could and overall my husband has been supportive. 

Lately my own depression has gotten very bad. Like not leave my bed, loss of appetite bad. And I feel my husband doesn‚Äôt understand. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm given any grace during this time period. And I really don‚Äôt think he does it from a malicious place I just don‚Äôt think he understands severe mental health issues or how best to support someone. Which I get. I don‚Äôt expect him to be my therapist. But I do expect him to be a support system for me and I just don‚Äôt feel that. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm just in my own head or what but it really feels like my depressive episodes are inconveniences to him. For example, past 48 hours have been awful. Something not done by either of us pushed me over the edge and every feeling came spilling out. Including how dark my thoughts are right now. I mean very concerning thoughts. I think it caught him off guard and I just went to bed. Today we tried to watch tv and I dragged myself out of bed to do so. I was snort laughing which happens sometimes and it felt so good to feel the little glimpses of joy that are so rare. He told me to stop because the sound was stressing me out. Knowing and seeing that I hadn‚Äôt smiled in two fucking days. 

I blew up at him and he tried to backtrack by saying he thought I was choking or something (obvious lie and doesn‚Äôt want to own up) 

And it just got me thinking about how I don‚Äôt feel like I can turn to him to support. And that my mental health will always be an annoyance to him. And I‚Äôm so scared he will leave me if I let myself fall to deep into these feelings. 

Idk what to do. I can‚Äôt imagine life without him I love him more than anything. but I‚Äôm finding myself even more depressed over the fact that I‚Äôm basically alone in this struggle. 

How do I have a successful relationship with someone when I‚Äôm in such a dark place. What can I tell him to do to be supportive. Idk how to navigate this 

FWIW, I am medicated and try to do a lot of things at home to keep my mental health good. haven‚Äôt gone to therapy as I moved states and finding a new one sucks.

I practice most of the time by just treating myself poorly, call myself names and insults, berating myself when I screw up something, used to cut myself for it. 

I'm a crybaby, most people just keep going but every time I just think about how nice it'd be if I were to slit my throat and get it over with, I just complain and cry about my problems as if they mattered.",0
"Hey so before going to the doctor and wasting money (incase my symptoms are not significant) I wanted to ask about whether my symptoms are something more severe. I had depression for nearly 8 years but the last 2 months it got so severe, I got loss of apetite, loss of sex drive, weight loss, increased suicidal thoughts, insomnia and during this time I started to get hallucinations for 8 days straight they were happening before sleeping and upon waking up the hallucinations were mostly auditory I actually planned to kill myself but didn't also these hallucinations stopped and now happening maybe once or twice per week I wanted to ask does someone have such experience ??

"i‚Äôm turning 31 very soon and it‚Äôs really starting to sink in that my depression is almost of legal drinking age. 
when i try to explain to most people that it‚Äôs not just being sad sometimes, it doesn‚Äôt go away, talking doesn‚Äôt help much, etc, it‚Äôs always the same reactions: ‚Äúwell it‚Äôll go away‚Äù ‚Äúwhen X changes, then you‚Äôll feel better‚Äù ‚Äúyou just have to get through this bout‚Äù. how do you really explain to someone that you‚Äôve wanted to die every single day (sans not a single day) since i was 11 years old. it seems unfathomable for most people which leads me to believe i might be actually crazy.

"
Hello, im a 17 years old girl with lots of trauma. For context my mom (40f) and my dad (38m) have their own traumas which are connected with their own parents. half of my family has mental issues and alcoholism. anyway, lets go to my story, when i was 7, i went to 1st grade of elementary school (im from Europe, i will not say what country). My dad picked his 10 hour long work, yes he‚Äôs working 10h per day. Im seeing him maybe 10 min per day for 10 years now. My dad is abusive emotionally towards me and sometimes my mom. For example, on my 14 bday he told me that he hates me and he never loved me cuz i didn‚Äôt went to school that day. And he‚Äôs always yelling at me that he spends money on my therapist, psychiatrist and meds. he hates the fact that i have LOTS of mental illnesses. Also i was bullied my WHOLE life in school, thats why i have my school online now. Plus, im not basic AT ALL from my appearance, and he‚Äôs always laughing at me how ugly i am. When i was a kid and i wanted his help he was yelling at me and telling me how stupid i am. Thats why when i was 11 years old i started sh and i was suicidal, and nothing changed to this day. On the other hand, my mom is drinking so much and she has alcohol issues. And she‚Äôs always yelling at me that its not true that she has issues with alcohol. Plus, shes never protecting me from my dad. For example, yesterday i came home crying cuz people were laughing at me on the street cuz of my looks and overall im extremely suicidal since 1 month. (i had suicide attempt 2 years ago and i want to repeat it) And my mom was complaining at me that im weak. Plus she told me that she have REAL trauma and problems and she‚Äôll die cuz of me. Plus she‚Äôs always yelling at me that she‚Äôll close me in mental asylum. honestly? i have nobody. my grandma which i was extremely close with died 4 years ago, she was only 52 years old. i have enough. i want to kms. and i feel like my parents are right. Is my trauma valid or i am overreacting? (obviously they‚Äôre examples cuz worse things happened with my parents)

Around five months later, I stopped touching my homework. Video games, porn, and weed became my life. I‚Äôm cringing writing that because it sounds so cliche, but it is painfully true. I refused to do any tests because it involved having to be watched via video chat, my heart raced and I became dizzy even thinking about having to feel the gaze of someone else on me, the awkward silence, and so this became my typical reaction to any anxiety provoking thoughts or situations.

"Just when I thought I had gotten better I get down to my lowest. All the inconveniences and problems just add up and suddenly I'm trying to numb my pain with binge drinking again. I try to keep myself occupied but most forms of entertainment just don't do it for me anymore. I recently started exercising again but the days where I really struggle I just can't bring myself to do anything but lay around and get drunk, its really the only time life feels bearable. 

Something a lot of people don't talk about is how hard it is to maintain or gain new relationships as an adult. Slowly all my friends have begun to drift apart not always for bad reasons but just the paths life takes you. There's probably two or three people I could really consider a friend but they don't live close and live busy lives so its hard to talk or see them regularly. I tried dating but I had so many bad experiences I just don't wanna subject myself to that torture anymore. 

I wouldn't consider myself suicidal anymore but the loneliness has really begun to eat me up. Some days I'm alright but other days it feels like I'm hanging on by a thread. I feel like I should be in therapy again but I have no insurance and couldn't afford that since I'm currently in the middle of trying to land a new job. So for now the cheap vodka will have to do.

Idk where should i really put this, but i really need to vent out to somebody at 1 am in the morning, a heavy heart pounding that keeps getting louder as time progress , staring aimlessly at the dark ceiling of my room, listening to the constant crickets and he distant barks through the window. I'm an 18M, and would probably be graduating in due time. I have antisocial and have an extreme anxiety as of late, and i have been depressed for nearly 6 months now. Ever since then, my life has been a constant downhill, and it looks like that it wouldn't be stopping. To the eyes of someone not close to me, I appear to be content with life and being able to help people in any way i can. Now, I just don't know anymore.

There are certainly a number of factors in why I have been depressed. But i want to discuss right now is what would eventually turn into losing of my closest friends. I have a feeling that in due time i will be losing all of my best friends, and it will be because of all of my wrongdoings. On our friend group, I was unknowingly making offensive jokes, thinking that it was that on that stage of being friends where we could tell some jokes and would just laugh it off. Without me knowing until recently, I have actually been offending one of my female friends that we would call ""Jewel"" for the time being
















It all started about 10 months ago, i was just starting a sense of depression feels like. Ever since grade school, I haven't made the one that i can truly call a friend since I have been switching schools every 3 years. When I went to my 11th grade, I only have 1 goal: to have tons of friends whom i could bond with even if we go separate ways to our dream colleges and future careers (ik my goal is a bit cliche but stay with me on this one). On the 1st month, I have met my future best friend, that for the sake of anonymity, we will call him ""Alan."" Alan was like the brother I never had. We had a lot of a common interest, and would be even be not exaggerating to call it too much. From the shows we watch, the games we play, hell even our music taste are the same! I couldn't have asked for a better friend like him.

Back to the topic at hand, at the height of my depression, Alan was the first one I have reached out to talk about it. I was really anxious and scared on what to tell him because this would be my first time opening up to someone. In the end, Alan comforted me on one of my toughest times and said to me that he'll be always avaliable.

"I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience to me. Does it get better? What helped you through the seemingly downward spiral? 

A few background things: I stopped taking my medication at the end of May. I stopped cold turkey (I know I shouldn't have, but I didn't want to stop during the school year as a teacher and deal with withdrawal symptoms). My doctor had me on 20mg Lexapro for a year and a half. I was also on 150 mg of Welbutrin for a time to curb side effects, but I stopped that way before May. Part of the reason I stopped both is because I kept forgetting to take them regularly, anyway. 

The first week or so, I was just irritated and felt kind of nauseous. I felt fine for the next 2-3 weeks and slowly, my depression symptoms have been creeping back in.

I am now at the point where I have a hard time even mustering up enough energy to eat something for most of the day, even when I'm hungry. I can't get anything done around the house unless I break into my reserve energy vault that leaves me exhausted. I really could sleep all day, every single day. I'm just so overwhelmed and have no real coping strategies to rely on at this point because getting out of bed or off the couch is so, so difficult.

Maybe I'm just going through a typical 16 year old's doomer phase or something and I'll have a brighter outlook on life sometime in the future but right now, I can't see why one's time in this world is concidered so precious and I never got a clear answer from anybody, all I ever got was either a ""Life is beautiful"" or ""You'll see out that life is beautiful"".

I just wanna know if there is even a point to my existance in today's world if my entire purpose is to work my good years away, and then die.

"I've always struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. If I mention therapy or drugs in front of my family, they look at me like I should be locked away.

Some days I feel like I should be. I've always been shy and introverted, but smart enough to recognize the signs that there are definitely issues going on. I can see the issues right in front of me, and yet I still spiral and self-destruct.

I've ruined every relationship I've had due to cheating and insecurities of feeling both inadequate and better than my partner. I recognize there is probably some underlying narcissism and potentially more issues than I can recognize. 

I never quite fit in anywhere, and I never felt like I belonged anywhere. Wherever I am I feel out of place. I feel like I'm just a spectator, not a participant in life. And the more I try to change, the more parts of me push back harder. 

I feel like I get used by people easily. ""Friends"" ask for money and I'm just so happy to have someone to talk to for 5 minutes I oblige. Then I get angry after the fact, flip out, and alienate more people from my life. 

I don't trust anybody anymore. Part of that is me projecting myself onto others; part of it is rooted in being fucked over too many times. 

I hate the way I look. I hate the way I think. And I hate the way I feel. Most of the time there's no joy in my life. The things that used to make me happy no longer do. I can barely eat, I can barely sleep. And I just feel like letting go.",0
"For background, I've been depressed for nearly 10-12 years now. I'm writing this because I came across a study with how depression can affect the brain. I don't believe I'm a lost cause although it constantly feels that way because of my habits, lack of motivation and brain.

It feels like a everyday battle with myself and my feelings. I don't feel sad rather disappointed and conflicted of my life- when that fails I feel empty. I am creative, I have always been creative so I constantly come with ideas but I get burnt out so easily. One day I feel so energetic before I fall back into the cycle of sleeping for days, not bothering to do anything. I feel like wasted potential because I know I can do better and I have in later years. Sometimes when I do feel motivated, my mind goes blank and I struggle to remember or physically do anything.

In the study, it showed how depression can cause memory loss, struggles with social abilities and also academic knowledge aswell. I don't believe my depression is at its peak but it's definitely gotten worse mentally, the only difference I can tell is in late years- I was more social and had a strict schedule to follow due to school, events and friends which forced me to get out. In recent years, I don't go out at all or speak to anyone. Normally, I rot away on social media or I'm social in my online presence by playing video games. I don't study anything, after HS I didn't know what do to in college (it's only been a few years after hitting 18). Studying and good grades were pressured on me negatively, causing me to lose any interest in school.

I can tell there's something wrong with my head, my mind feels so blurry like I can't focus. I can't find motivation to do anything, I feel very numb and lost. I can barely spell anymore without auto correct on my phone, same with keeping up with clean handwriting. My memory is like a Goldfish, sometimes I can remember the day before or even what I've done the current day when speaking to my partner. I can feel that I've gotten almost stupider and that my brain is just literally loosing braincells. It's a repeating cycle that i wish to stop, i was so smart before- i could spell most words, i would dedicate myself to art n ideas, i would even get out more. I know and need to make a change so I can get better for my future. At the moment, therapy isn't a option for me and same with medicine but here's what I've added to my daily life.

1. Green tea, it's simple but it's the very start of my routine. It's a ""beginning"" but also has benefits
2. Healthy meals, I stopped buying processed food and instant. I buy minimum items but I try to stick to fresh things like fruit, veggies and nuts. Although i still have trouble finding motivation to get up and cook.
3. Sleeping early, this is hard considering I have Insomnia but I find myself the most productive when I accept that I can't stay up all night- there will always be another day for me to do more.
4. Lists, lists seem to help me alot. I normally list items I need to buy for self-care and budget
5. Walking, as of now- I don't walk due to it feeling like hell outside but it was refreshing to do. Exercise is helpful
6. Showering, finding motivation to shower can be hard when you're laying in bed but I use this as a point to try to start my day and feel more awake.

I'm unsure if these things will 100% help me considering depression has affected me for years now but it's a start, this isn't advice for anyone but if you feel like it can be beneficial to you then go for it. After reading the study, i heard practicing things such as quick math, writing and grammar helped people. I also wish to extend my attention span by watching long TV shows or doing tasks for a few hours. I might give a update",0
"I need advice on what to do.
Basically I used to cry so much over everything small. Now I barley even cry I'm just numb. And idk and my mum thinks I have no feelings now but I just can't cry.

"Until recently, I thought this was a normal way to feel, that everyone felt this way. I've felt it since I was young. I realize a lot of it is due to the way I was raised, but it doesn't stop me from feeling that sense of perversion and guilt for feeling genuinely happy, that sense of wrongness that stops any peace. I don't really know how to stop feeling that way and how to stop sabotaging any good feelings. Even if I talk to a friend, they give me platitudes or matter of facts at best that don't really change how I feel. I want to change but I'm not sure how.",0
"From the age of 13 when my dad died until a few months ago(im 23 now) I had the mindset that I didn't need to be happy to survive. (""Im not a good person if I complain about my sadness when there is more suffering out there"").

I experienced bullying in school, lacked money, and had no desire to do anything outside of my home. Also, I felt inferior to others. Throughout high school, I never hung out with friends, and my only distractions were video games and music. 

When I entered university, my social anxiety improved, but I still lacked the desire to connect with people or pursue hobbies. I completed my degree and only went out with friends once during that time.

Despite this, I forced myself to engage in normal hobbies, watch movies and series, and participate in sports. I didn't want to appear as the odd one who had no interests or conversation topics. Happiness wasn't a priority; my goal was to have a decent professional career and support my family, I wanted the people next to me to be happy even if I wasnt.

However, fate intervened this year when I met a woman on a dating app who showed genuine interest in me just as I am. We shared everything in common, and our three-month relationship made me feel alive, not just existing. Unfortunately, she ended things and returned to her ex. I feel so empty now.

I know normal people would just get another gf, but I feel every single human is unique, and if wasnt her, Im sure I wouldnt ever have a relationship.

I have no complaints about the people around me or my job. People are generally kind, and I reciprocate that kindness. However, I lack motivation to do anything. I just keep doing what I have to do. My willpower exists solely to avoid disappointing others. I exercise and eat healthily for physical well-being, and I try to be sociable. 

I have no goals, no enjoyment in anything, no hobbies, no desire to travel, or acquire material possessions, or meet other women. I even stopped playing videogames, guitar and piano.

Yet, I can't contemplate ending my life because I want to continue supporting my family. I cant let my family become sad because of my death, and I really fear death myself, so I am afraid I am unable to get used to live a sad life again.

Opinions?

"Hello everyone.

I'm 27 years old, and I've been dealing with depression since 11 I think. I am diagnosed, but the diagnosis came when I was like 20 or so.

On my daily life I don't have a lot of struggles I'd say, nor do I have any suicidal thoughts (never had). I can't really cry either, the last time was years and years ago, spontaneously while hugging my sister.

Anyways, I decided to make this post because I have a question. I feel like I have a severe case of apathy. I don't care about almost anything except of my family, I have no desires, basically no plans for the future. I'm just existing, like I'm on some kind of limbo.

It feels awful but at the same time it feels like... The thought of going back to being healthy (although I don't remember how that was) sounds false. It sounds like a lie. After experiencing all this emptiness and apathy, the idea of having a fulfilling life simply sounds fake, like turning a blind eye to all of this. Does anyone feels the same?",0

"Hello, I (21F) had my first experience with antidepressants in the form of (25mg for 2 weeks then 50mg) Zoloft beginning 5/3/24. A month later, I switched to 10mg Lexapro cold turkey due to my provider‚Äôs recommendation because I wasn‚Äôt feeling better. Another month later 6/4/24, a new doc suggested I switch to 150mg Wellbutrin cold turkey 7/9/24 since I didn‚Äôt feel much different on Lexapro either. This doc said since I didn‚Äôt have any withdrawal symptoms cold turkeying from Zoloft to Lexapro I should be fine doing the same Lexapro to Wellbutrin. Today is my fourth day of being on Wellbutrin and I can positively say I feel significantly worse. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs symptoms of withdrawal or the Wellbutrin. I feel moody like when I PMS (sad, extreme loneliness) but on top of that I feel empty/hopeless in moments I‚Äôm alone. It‚Äôs making me anxious. I also feel like I‚Äôm withdrawing myself from social situations which is odd because I am someone who craves company 24/7 as a result of abandonment issues. Can anyone else relate? Also, after studying several Reddit posts I feel as though I didn‚Äôt give Lexapro enough time? Many people have said they didn‚Äôt begin to feel better until 6-8 weeks in. Additionally, I‚Äôm wondering if I just haven‚Äôt been as observant as I should be with my mood/conditions while one these medications. ",0
"I don‚Äôt post normally but I need a way to get my feelings out other than say Facebook or things such as that. 

Here‚Äôs my story‚Ä¶. Grab a seat and a snack and be ready for this. None of it is good. 

I‚Äôve been dealing with mental health all my life. I was 5 when I was diagnosed with bipolar, adhd, autism, anger issues and disgraphia. I‚Äôve been living a shadow of a life ever since. 

My family wanted me to get counseling because of my several attempts of killing myself or saying I would as a kid. I‚Äôve white knuckled my way through life. I‚Äôm 23 now and I don‚Äôt look like it nor do I act like it. I‚Äôm old for someone my age. 

For instance I like jazz and things most people my age don‚Äôt. 
Just out of place. 

Depression didn‚Äôt really start until I got a little older. It was after high school when I really started to notice that I just don‚Äôt care anymore. Living off of impulse and do what I want. Screw everyone else. I‚Äôm just so tired of doing that all the time. I‚Äôve been put on medication that almost killed me several times. I‚Äôve had to change psychiatrists several times because of this. 

I know I‚Äôm not the only one but I‚Äôm definitely one of a few. I‚Äôm out of place and out of time. I don‚Äôt want to kill myself but I‚Äôm not opposed to anything or anyone doing it. I‚Äôm just done with everything you know? 

I can‚Äôt talk to my family anymore about it. I live in my own and have burned all the bridges in my family. I‚Äôve had what most have not. Help. And I just threw it away because it wasn‚Äôt the help that I needed. 

Here is a little context for you. 

When I was 3 my mother and father got divorced. Ever since I‚Äôve been under the same conclusion. It‚Äôs my fault. Because I‚Äôm different than my entire family. 
My grandfather who was like a father to me, passed away november 22 2018. I graduated 2019. I‚Äôve never felt more defeated in all my life until he was taken from me. I‚Äôve always had a want to help others. After he died, so did I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not ok in the slightest and I know that. But what is stupid is that I‚Äôm comfortable in my depression but at the same time I‚Äôm tired of it. The main reason I don‚Äôt change is because I‚Äôm numb. 
It‚Äôs not a matter of not wanting to, it‚Äôs a matter of feeling worthless and unwanted but at the same time loved and wanted. These are mixed signals as clear as the sky is blue. 
This has been an issue since I was little. 

I‚Äôm different and I don‚Äôt trust anyone anymore. I‚Äôm just fed up of trying. 

I‚Äôm also flirtatious by nature. I try not to be but my mouth gets me into trouble. I tell my self one thing and do the opposite. I‚Äôve lost several jobs this way. I want to go mute because of this. 

I‚Äôve host lost all hope by this point that I can change and that I should even try. Maybe this is my fate to be the super villain of my story. I don‚Äôt know. I just don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not even tired anymore. I just don‚Äôt care and don‚Äôt want to do anything. I‚Äôve just lost my will and want to live because what‚Äôs the point. My family and friends all tell me I have this great potential but I‚Äôve never seen it myself. I won‚Äôt kill my self but if someone else does it, by all means go for it. I know my family and friends love me but I don‚Äôt love myself. I‚Äôve hated myself since the day I learned the word. ",0

If you bottle it up you feel like you‚Äôre gonna explode. If you eat you get fat. If you don‚Äôt eat you feel like a zombie. Is there any way to win?

"Tout d‚Äôabord d√©sol√© si il y a des erreurs mais c‚Äôest mon premier post. J‚Äôai 19 ans et depuis le coll√®ge j‚Äôai toujours eu une sorte de mal √™tre en moi. J‚Äôai fini par accepter qu‚Äô√† ce moment l√† je me donnais cette image de moi car je trouvais √ßa un peu ""styl√©"". Mais bon j‚Äôavais d√©j√† le sentiment de vivre pour autrui (mes parents) et non √† 100% pour moi-m√™me. Ma p√©riode lyc√©e on va dire que √ßa s‚Äôest accentu√©, c‚Äô√©tait plus juste pour les cam√©ras. J‚Äôai v√©cu une longue relation dans laquelle j‚Äôme consid√©rais heureux mais j‚Äô√©tais totalement tomb√© dans de la d√©pendance affective. (Avec du recul les moments o√π je me sens √©panouis ne d√©pendent pas vraiment de moi mes des autres). Mon bonheur d√©pendait √©norm√©ment de ses actions, pens√©es ou encore sa pr√©sence. A cette p√©riode je me sentais d√©j√† tr√®s seul. J‚Äôavais certes des potes mais tr√®s peu que je consid√©rais comme grand ami. Au c√¥t√© de ce groupe de pote je me sentais seul en √©tant accompagn√© et m√™me si √ßa va un peu mieux aujourd‚Äôhui je ne me suis pas vraiment fait d‚Äôautres potes depuis. Il y avait beaucoup de moments o√π je parlais sans √™tre √©cout√©/entendu malgr√© mes efforts. Pour d‚Äôautres raisons √©galement j‚Äôavais d√©cid√© de concentrer toute mon attention envers ma copine de l‚Äô√©poque qui a fini par me quitter il y a 1 an. J‚Äôai donc ressenti l‚Äôimpression d‚Äôavoir perdu √† la fois ma copine, ma meilleure amie et tout mon entourage non familial. Cette ann√©e fut t√©moin d‚Äôune √©norme remise en question et r√©flexion sur moi m√™me. Je ne me suis jamais senti seul et triste de toute ma vie. Pourtant il y a pire j‚Äôai une famille, des personnes sur qui compter, je peux manger √† ma faim mais je ne sais pas il manque un truc. J‚Äôai √©galement 0 but dans la vie, je ne sais pas quoi faire comme m√©tier et j‚Äôai vraiment peur du futur car je m‚Äôint√©resse √† tr√®s peu de choses. J‚Äôai d‚Äôailleurs tendances √† trop vouloir rester dans ma zone de conforts. Par exemple pour jouer ou regarder des films ou s√©ries je pr√©f√®re souvent revoir ou rejouer aux m√™mes jeux/films. Depuis mon enfance je crains √©norm√©ment la mort de mes parents car je sais que ce sera peut √™tre le d√©but de la fin pour moi. C‚Äôest d‚Äôailleurs la seule raison concr√®te qui me d√©chire et me fait pleurer de temps √† autre. R√©cemment j‚Äôai v√©cu un peu + d‚Äô1 mois en √©tant dans un vrai mood Good vibe mais je sens clairement une rechute depuis plusieurs jours. Pourtant je suis dans une p√©riode o√π je ne suis jamais sorti autant avec des potes si fr√©quemment de toute ma vie. Apr√®s une fois chez moi je passe plus de 80% du temps dans mon lit sur mon phone.
Un truc qui me fait remettre en question mon √©tat est le fait que j‚Äôai beaucoup + souvent envie de dispara√Ætre et non de mourir. Car je sais qu‚Äôil y a quand m√™me des bons moments √† passer et mourir entra√Ænerait la tristesse de mon entourage et que j‚Äôaurai des regrets. Je n‚Äôai jamais fait de TS, scarification ou autres. Les seuls trucs ""b√™tes"" de ce genre que j‚Äôai fait sont de boire ou fumer comme un golmon en soir√©e.
En bref j‚Äôaimerai savoir si je vis une d√©pression ou si je suis d√©prim√©. J‚Äôai d√©j√† vu un psy et infirmiers mais cela ne s‚Äôest pas bien pass√© car c‚Äô√©tait tout le temps moi qui parlait et n‚Äôavait aucune r√©ponse √† mes questions. Pour vous aiguiller voici les sympt√¥mes que j‚Äôai + ou - selon les p√©riodes : 

-Tristesse
-Solitude/Isolement volontaire ou non 
-Petit ou fort app√©tit 
-Fatigue quotidienne
-Mauvais rythme et peu de sommeil
-Id√©es suicidaires
-Peur et d√©sespoirs de l‚Äôavenir

"I have a good life on paper.   I'm educated, have a good job, good friends, and a good family.  The problem is that I am 47 years old and can't seem to find a lasting relationship. I'm also not very attractive.  I meet women who swear up and down that they love me and want to grow old with me.  I think they fall in love with me because I make them laugh, and I'm good in bed. Things are usually good for a while, and then they leave.  I have been dumped twice via text by live in partners.   Recently, I got engaged, and now my fiancee is unsure about the relationship.   She took her ring off.  We had some stressors in our relationship. She wouldn't talk to me about it, and instead, gave me the silent treatment.  I talked to one of my friends about it because I needed an ear and advice.  I needed some comfort and to figure out how to fix things.    This angered my fiancee.  She didn't appreciate me airing our dirty laundry to someone else, which is a fair complaint.   I should have kept my feelings to myself.  Anyway, it appears I have failed at yet another relationship because she requested I keep my distance from her, and I have.  I've mostly isolated myself in one of our bedrooms, only emerging to walk the dog or go to work.  I have not engaged in conversation or even initiated any text messages.  The last time we had an actual conversation she told me she feels I don't listen to her.  I waited until she was done talking and summarized what she said.  I even asked if my summary was correct. She said it was.  Later on she texted me saying she is taking her ring off because she is unsure about the relationship.  I really thought I had gotten things right this time.  The biggest problem is that there's a child involved, and I love him too.  I have been a step mom to him for nearly 2 years. The thought of losing both of them is devastating.  I get it, though.  I'm just not good enough of a person to deserve love. It feels like I'm unworthy. I feel despondent. I haven't talked to anyone about this because I don't want her to feel like I'm airing our dirty laundry to any of our friends. Instead, I'm airing it here, I guess.   I'm not even sure why.  Maybe I'm hoping if I let it out, it will help?  I just don't know.   I don't feel like I have anything to lose at this point, and I don't feel like life is worth living anymore.  What's the point of it all?    Anyway, I have 800 units of regular insulin ready to go.   Thanks for reading.

"I(34F) have come to the realization over the last 6 months or so that I may be ""depressed"", incapable of feeling genuine happiness or excitement. Absolutely nothing triggers any dopamine or any sense of joy. None of the things that I used to look forward to or jump out of bed about gives me the same feeling or any feeling at all anymore.
I've gone through a lot in the last year, and life has a funny sense of humor at my expense it seems. 
For example, I was finally ""excited"" for my birthday this year, and the morning of I woke up at 8am with a migraine so bad..I was in bed until 4 pm canceling the plans my boyfriend made.  Then I went out to meet my best friend once I was well enough (plans he made a week prior), and he never showed, ending a 14 year long friendship.

Another example.. going on a trip I've been looking forward to for months and spent loads on..only to get my period (off schedule) the day we arrive and be in so much pain and unable to do many activities for days .

Meeting friends for a concert we've all been looking forward to..only to have them no show. That's happened twice this year, different friends.

I could go on and on and on with similar examples..

I've lost so many friendships this year because I no longer tolerated the one sidedness of it. If I don't reach out.. they are gone. 

My workplace brings me down more than anything, and ive tried out other jobs but they just don't pay as well. So right now I'm not working much.
I just don't know how to cope. 
I feel numb and no longer capable of achieving anything above a 5/10 on the mood scale. My boyfriend and I have a wonderful relationship, but i know this weighs on him because he is such an excitable person.
Does anyone have any sort of advice? 
I'd like to do therapy, but I have no insurance at my job and it's not in my budget.
I've tried friendship apps and going out to meet new groups.. no luck.

I know this sounds so wah wah stop crying. I'm annoyed at myself most of the time believe me..but I'm desperate for some real advice/help. ",0
"so, hi, i just woke up from a sleep that i have been struggling to fix lately .

(since i have been staying up all night for the past few months, i decided to change it last night and i did wake up 2 times under a 2 hr interval but its all good)

i woke up the 2nd time and i decided to not go back to sleep immediately in order to write this clutching thought of mine so i could get some peace:

'i don't want to exist for a while'

stil looms over my head a few months ago and grew ever more strongly these past few weeks . 

with repetitive days coming by (days feeling like it doesnt progress, but rather loops), problems, responsibilities, and things you hate about 'life' coming onto you like a landslide of some sorts. yeah, its taken a toll on me mentally.

i could summarize it as just me losing it and losing interest in life as my philosophy has definitely circled around itself as 'there's not much significance to be around' anymore i say.

i grew up in an okay religious family and i was treated okay, finances are okay and etc. so definitely not a family problem .

lol idk what 2 write anymore definitely, i ran out of fuel or i just simply lost interest anymore in continuing this as suppose to my enthuaism earlier in the first few sentences of this post.

it hurts, i don't want to be something or someone, i don't want to feel anxious everyday, feel pressured everyday, and sad everyday whenever i see or think of myself.

"I've been living with my ex gf for 5 years. It's been a really long time and she was my first ever gf. We broke up roughly a year and a half ago but we have still been living together with her two cats (who we got as kittens 5 years ago). We've had our ups and downs and argue sometimes, but we also laugh together and I do enjoy talking to her.

A few weeks ago, she suddenly told me that she will be moving to her own place. I understand why she wants to, but it just came as a shock to me. My little brother is in a bad situation at the moment, and he comes here every week to stay with us. He looked extremely sad and worried when I told him that I'll have to leave, and this made me more upset.

To make matters worse, she's taking the cats (who I have bonded with and lived with since they were kittens). She's leaving today and I'm really dreading it and feel extremely upset about it. I'll move to my grandmother's house in a few weeks, and I'm REALLY not looking forward to that but I have no other option.

Another thing is that I have had a new serious relationship for roughly a year, but she also hasn't been able to live with me. And to make things even worse....it seems like she will break up with me soon. It kind of feels like I'm losing two people at once (along with my cats) and also won't be able to hang out with my little brother regularly anymore.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I might finally be able to realize my dream and live overseas in 6 months. Not having to pay rent anymore by living at my grandmother's house will enable me to save up and finally go. That makes me really nervous but I'm also excited as it is my dream.

I'm usually a happy-go-lucky person and rarely get sad, but this is the first time in my life that I feel genuinely depressed and really upset. Not sure how to handle it and would really appreciate some advice.

tl;dr My ex gf moving out with the cats and I feel like my whole world is changing. I'm not sure how to cope with this.",0
Does anyone feel ok until late at night? Sometimes I drink and then I feel it but also when I stay home and bad thoughts happen late?,0
"Heh, 21 years constantly fighting on a warpath. Achieving success after success, building myself up and investing in myself. Only for all of it to be stripped away. Once a genetically modified freak of nature, only to end up as mere flesh and bones. No medical objective reason. Alone with my thoughts, voluntarily. Albeit I can‚Äôt even hear them anymore. 

Every single day, helping countless people. Life deserves to be a place of serenity and tranquility for everyone.

Or so I thought.

I have reached to a point where: I no longer formulate thoughts in my head. Constant autopilot mode, pure instinct. These decades of reading, absorbing knowledge, working tirelessly for validation only to become a laughing stock. Focus? Concentration? Achieving tasks? Used to mean something to me, it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have the energy to talk. It‚Äôs just I literally don‚Äôt come up with anything of use. Thoughts that used to take me milliseconds to form now take minutes. It‚Äôs painful watching this fall from grace yet live it as well. 

Emptiness, hollowness. Numb. 
These 3 words pretty much sum up my situation. 

I honestly still don‚Äôt know the reason I get out of bed. I‚Äôve seen my family and friends reach out and try their utmost best to help me. Can‚Äôt pour out of an empty cup sadly. It takes me an insurmountable amount of effort to even utter words. 

I am too much of a coward to proceed with my life, or do anything really. So this raises the question, ‚ÄúWhy Live?‚Äù I am also too much of a coward to take my own life.

Crossroads, I have now decided to fully confine myself in my room. Spend the rest of my days staring into the abyss, 0 activity. Just pondering the walls of my room. Only then will I feel true inner peace having obliterated my life rather than face public humiliation. I don‚Äôt get to hear it anymore. 

Ambition? Drive? Passion? Aspirations? Goals? Nah. I‚Äôll pass. I tried and I have nothing left to give anymore. 

I am about to go to a therapist (forced by my father) tomorrow. I grew up in a community where mental health is severely stigmatized due to heavy religious influence so I wonder what her reactions going to be when I showcase this adamant desire. Truly is pathetic. 




For the first time in my life, I‚Äôve went from a social bubbly person to embracing 4 months of self-inflicted self-sabotage. All sense of self-identity, self-worth, self esteem has virtually dissipated. Can‚Äôt even follow along plots of shows anymore. Don‚Äôt remember anything. Purely living in the moment. The bliss of being alone! 

Should I document this journey Im about to embark? I‚Äôm 100% serious that I will genuinely live the rest of my days locked in my room with no socialization or any form of contact. Atleast that way people can examine and I can atleast have my legacy be that as an experiment. I‚Äôm willing to purchase a camera and send the footage to anyone who wants it, sort of like a vlog lmao. Eh idk spitballing ig.

"I've always felt a feeling of depression within myself growing up. Id say I am a happy personality with a sad soul. I never considered it to be depression because I did not have terrible thoughts about myself or feelings of worthlessness until 2020. It slowly increased and In 2021 I experienced a very dark depression and finally understand the true meaning of it. You truly cannot grasp how it feels until you've experience the pain and the thoughts. It's like no matter what you have, do or know, the thoughts and feelings do not falter. I tried so many coping mechanisms to make life better but could not get my mind to heal. I knew I had a desirable life on the outside looking in, and still felt such worthlessness, self hate and did not want to continue living. I contemplated and planned suicide a lot. I'd cry every single day and drown in the misery of waking up again and having to go through more life. It felt as though anything I try to do to make life better, it made it worse. It is such an internal battle. I finally started taking antidepressant during that time period because I started to actively seek out ways to commit suicide and get the means to do so. It healed my mind so much. I finally felt happy again, id speak to my mom and just tell her how happy I feel everyday. I stopped after a while and still felt some depressive symptoms but not as deep and harrowing. I also have ADHD. I changed a lot of aspects of my life and did a lot of reflection and introspection and I do feel better generally in life. I think back at this time and it feels like such a traumatic life event. Just having my brain be so dark. Its an unforgettable feeling and time of my life that changed me so much.

With that being said this past year in 2023 I broke up with a boyfriend of 8 years who cheated and then got into a very traumatic, abusive relationship with a narcissist. A canon event I'd say. The abuse, betrayal and evil I experienced from someone I loved was so extreme and confusing. It left me with no job or home because I had to escape from him and run to a different state for my safety. Ive been struggling to heal from this and find work as well. Reflecting on all of this and the current state of my life leaves me very sad. Rebuilding my self worth as well as being completely alone every day is very saddening after having back to back very codependent relationships. I am very unproductive and sit home every day with barely any social interactions. I know I need hobbies and activities but its hard to find motivation... With that being said I do not feel that depressed. I'm sad often but I would not say I feel those deep depressive feelings that I once struggled so deeply with. I can still find some happiness in my day to day. Before, any inconvenience would send me off the deep end but even with all of this new trauma, I do not feel that way. I don't feel depressed but I often feel like ending my life because the struggle of life, the economy and loneliness is just so unbearable and unenjoyable. No plans or real desire but it's a reocurring thought.

It almost seems like once you feel deep depression and suicidal thoughts, they will always return. Depression kind of feels like a cycle or even like an addiction. Not that you desire it but in a way that you go into periods of remission or sobriety and then those thoughts creep up and you bask in your dark feelings. Its like you try not to relapse and when you feel yourself slipping you have to fight, and it scares you. Or even like a spectrum that you constantly teeter on. Its almost like you can never get rid of the darkness inside of you. Sometimes I think I enjoy feeling deep emotion, whether good or bad. But bad emotions run so deep they sometimes feel intoxicating.... Can anybody relate to this?",0
"Tell me if anyone understands what I feel

I‚Äôm so depressed and all I want is to die. I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and my partner made me make an appointment with my therapist. I am not on any medication but I had some old expired antidepressant medication at home and my therapist was aware of it. My therapist asked if I took any medication and I said yes. Then he asked if I took more than one and I said, Im doing well now. He continued by asking did you do intentional overdose on your medication and I responded, Im doing well now and I don‚Äôt like to talk about it. He said he wants to talk with my partner and I declined. Then he said that he has to call a police for well ness check and after some begging and discussion I relented and let him talk with my partner. He told my partner every thing and after that call, my partner collected all my pills and ruined my plan for my next overdose. The therapist told my partner that I will receive a call for iop program. I have not received the call yet but I will reject it once they call. I am mad at both of them and I am thinking to cut my hand deep ( never have done cutting) or take a bunch of Tylenol. I am feeling very sad, no motivation for anything, and when I secretly hurt myself by overdose I feel better. I don‚Äôt want to get any help and I hate myself. I think that my problem is myself, being a stupid lazy person and therapy and medication won‚Äôt be helpful. Will I be hospitalized if anyone finds out my cuts are intentional?

"I don't know how to really start this. It's hard for me to ask for help as a adult man. But I'm in need of help immediately. I have put this off for far to long after being told by a friend I should ask for help here. Let's start with why I need help. This is a lot so bare with me please. I feel I need to tell the whole story so everyone that is going to help knows exactly what happened even if it means putting all my personal information out there. The main thing I am worried about is my oldest son. He has been struggling with adhd and depression since he started school. He is on medication and sees doctors twice a month for it. To say the least I'm his strong backbone that helps him when he has his bad days. I was forced to leave him and ever since he had really been struggling. I'm asking for help to fix my car (650) and get gas money (350)to get back to be in the same state with him and as well as my other kids but he needs me the most especially now. He is turning 10 on July 18th. I want to be back there for him and with him as soon as possible. I can't describe how much stress this has caused me mentally and physically. I been working at a dead end job to just try and stay afloat and get my car fixed which just stopped working so I can get back to him. I'm really ashamed to ask for help as a grown man. But it isn't about me anymore. I need to get back to him and I can't do it on my own.I NEED HELP. PLEASE.


Here is a back story to what happened to get me in this situation. At the end of last year 2023 around November I lose my home that I worked to keep for two years. ( A lil back story. I'm not trying to bash anyone or place all blame on anyone because I'm at somewhat fault as well for not seeing the signs. I was blinded by what I thought was love. It all started on Christmas Eve 2021 when my life began to change. My and my girlfriend of a year at the time were in a a really bad car accident. She was injured pretty bad. So I took on the mantle of providing for our family. This turned out to be a crucial decision. I spent the next two years busting my tail to provide for her and her daughter as well as my own three kids I have. It was working out pretty good for a year or more or so. I was able to maintain our home and both our cars. It started to get overwhelming after such a lengthy period of time. In this time I exhausted all my avenues of trying to stay afloat and allowing her to heal properly by staying at home and me taking all responsibilities for everything. I maxed out all my credit cards and was working two jobs day and night to try to be the man and keep everything that I had gotten for us. I finally after so long pressured her to start looking for a job I could no longer do it alone. Which gets to where the main problems started to happen. I didn't realize how much pressure I was putting on her because I was stressed out and maxed out. Well this pressure actually made things worst because now things she didn't say before came to light. Which was she was depressed on how the car accident made her look and feel and she shut down. So for the next half of year or so when I begged for help and pleaded I couldn't do it anymore. Things took a turn for the worst. Instead of helping me she shut down. Then month by month we ended up getting lights turned off. Next month water turned off. It was just a domino affect. One thing lead to another. Robbing Peter to pay Paul as they say. Finally it came to a head and we were kicked out of our home because turns out she was not paying the bills like I thought she was. Which is why I take blame I put all that on her to pay the bills (as in call in and make sure they were paid since I was working to make the money for them. All while she was not doing that. She was depressed coming to find out because of how she felt after the accident. So instead of paying the bills she used lots of the money for self care which turned out to be cheating as well. So we are kicked out and all of our things put on the curb. I was then forced to move states away from my kids with family because I had no where else to go. I'm am cracking under the pressure mentally and physically to be quite honest. Seeing my son struggle ever since I had to leave is heart breaking. I'm only asking for help to fix my car and gas to get back there. I already have a friend that is going to allow me to stay with them until I get back on my feet so I can be closer to my kids. I have secured a job for when I get back there so I'm not asking for handouts and not doing anything positive to help myself. I just need a little help to get ahead.


Anthing would help whether it's a dollar or two or if your feeling more generous. I just want to get back to my son where I belong and where he needs me. I thank everyone in advance for taking the time to read my story and possibly helping. Thank you may God bless us all.

"To be fair, I have a lot of things to be grateful for. I‚Äôm not starving and I have family that cares enough to let me at least stay with them again (though I‚Äôm afraid of my mental health tanking with them). I‚Äôve had bad mental health issues since I was 12 years old, that was my first time attempting to harm myself and feeling like dying. I had bad internalized homophobia over liking women and I had to get over that recently. I ended up dating a guy during covid in college summer of 2020. I don‚Äôt want to say he was completely abusive. I was horrible and toxic in my own way due to my own traumas, and there are things I should‚Äôve never done, like be overly jealous and threw things he bought me away out of spite, or dropping his toothbrush on the bathroom floor rug after an argument, which I immensely regret because it turns out it could‚Äôve caused bad illness, as well as having a meltdown in front of him which caused him to freak out. But the sexual stuff really fucked me up and how I see my body. I learned after telling people I was definitely raped‚Ä¶and gaslit into thinking I wasn‚Äôt. I even feel weird saying that because it doesn‚Äôt feel real. I thought I was making it up as an excuse to act mentally ill. He did things that I didn‚Äôt consent to on more than one occasion. And shamed me into feeling like crap for asking him to‚Ä¶ask. I explicitly said no when trying to do my homework. I pretended to be ok with the sudden fingering. Then I said no sex tho. Then he just kinda did it. And I pretended to be ok with it. Afterwards I just cried in the shower and kept thinking about it when I was trying to do my homework. It wasn‚Äôt just that. I realized he would constantly sexualize me. He didn‚Äôt really give a fuck about my hobbies or interests or playing cool games together. The worst time was when I was trying to show off a lego set I got for christmas, after my dad was arrested for a dui (I was supposed to talk to him about his alchoholism but didn‚Äôt wanna ruin christmas so I felt like it was my fault). He said he didn‚Äôt give a fuck and asked me to flash my tits, which I did hesitantly. I took nudes of myself for him and he threatened to break up two days after that. I was basically personal jerkoff material and felt sexually humiliated. I was also pressured into sex in my own car in the beginning of our relationship. I never really got support from my mom after telling her. I guess she just wanted me to not let it affect my academic performance. I know I could‚Äôve stayed home, but I felt so guilty for letting it affect me and wanted to prove I wasn‚Äôt broken. I didn‚Äôt want to be seen as a failure because of what happened to me. Plus, I don‚Äôt feel completely safe around my family. One of the biggest things keeping me in that relationship was thinking I was receiving love and praise that I hadn‚Äôt gotten from my family in years. I went through a bad hypersexual phase, thankfully online though, realized I was a lesbian, but the feelings around how much I hate my body and especially being female are surfacing. I keep feeling like I should be a boy instead now. Ever since I left that relationship I keep having new identity crisis themes or anxieties that I have to constantly think about or else I feel something bad will happen. I feel like such a different person. I look at the person I was before that relationship. I was depressed and mentally ill as well as undiagnosed autistic at the time, but I was so excited to finally get out of my household. Now I even feel like I‚Äôve developed gender dysphoria. I can‚Äôt stand my useless body. I need to be on meds and therapy again. I feel so angry with everyone who was supposed to help and support me. ",0

"Not a long rant cause I have tried to explain this to friends and family but they dont understand what I mean, and why i cant just let go.

I am obsessing over the intent of my own actions. Weather im nice because im \*actually\* nice, or am I just subconsciously behaving in such a way that makes me likable. And ontop of this I've been making massive mistakes, and hurting people i really care about. I hate even to be angry or upset with people, let alone actually inflict any emotional or physical harm.   
Im pushing everyone away cause I dont want to hurt them, and Im afraid to talk to people cause I feel so two faced if im just behaving in ways that make me likable.

Again, I know it sounds stupid to be hung up on things like that because life happens, and every person wants to be liked (as I have been told numerous times). But i just cant let it go.

A friend suggested I might have a type of OCD called Moral Scrupulosity, and it fits really well with how ive been feeling for the past year, but I dont want to self diagnose or claim anything cause I could be far off. Difficult to see the painting if your one of the strokes, kinda thing.",0

"I live in a constant state of dissatisfaction, regret, envy, and self-loathing. 
 
People think I‚Äôm exaggerating when I say this but there is truly nothing I like about myself. I don‚Äôt like how I look. I don‚Äôt like how I sound. I don‚Äôt like how my mind works.

I hate how pathetic I am, how stupid I am. I‚Äôve become everything I look down on. I have no accomplishments. No medals. Sure life isn‚Äôt about medals but they are to me. To be praised, to be envied, to be held in high regard. I envy my athletic classmates all the time. It‚Äôs too late for me to be a prodigy. I‚Äôm not good at anything. Anything I‚Äôm remotely decent doing is clouded by the fact that it will never give me what I want and I would trade it any day for something else. 

I want nothing out of life. I hate nature. I hate the rain. Hate the sun. I hate when people think that I should care about losing these things. There‚Äôs nothing I like that isn‚Äôt tied to being a consumer. I am materialistic at heart and I don‚Äôt plan on changing my ways. I consume what I can afford and dream about consuming things that are expensive. But even that will never fill the hole I feel where there should be a zest for living.

I don‚Äôt care. I can only see life going down from here (shitty college and generally not motivation to get out of bed). Yeah yeah life isn‚Äôt about where you go or whatever. We all hear it. But for someone like me, these things are important. I believe people are measured by their achievements and success. I believe that life is linear. You do this, you do that, and you do it well. 

Everywhere I look, I‚Äôm dissatisfied with how things work and look down on everything including myself. I hate and look down on this country. I look down on my school. I look down on my family and friends. I look down on the bad things happening in the world.

Sure, some might venture to say that it‚Äôs this dissatisfaction with the world that makes it my calling to change it or fucking something. But there is nothing and no one I look down on more than myself. It‚Äôs not just my circumstances I despise, it‚Äôs me. I am disgusted with myself. 

The answer is simple right? Just change then. Some would say. But I can‚Äôt change. I don‚Äôt want to. I will remain in this cycle. Because it‚Äôs not my actions I hate (though it‚Äôs also a part of it). It‚Äôs my person. I hate the person I am at my very core. I hate how I squirm when my wrongdoings are held in front of me like a child caught in a lie, with my mouth open like a fish. I hate how people see right through me. I hate how I pretend to be smarter than I really am but if you really quiz me, I know nothing. I don‚Äôt have the answers. I‚Äôm not interesting. 

The only things I don‚Äôt hate and I think are worth looking at are the things that make me envious. And when I envy, my stomach is twisted into a knot and I feel nauseous. I‚Äôm constantly jealous. But I don‚Äôt plan on removing the things that make me jealous because I deserve to feel jealous. It‚Äôs torture seeing the people have what I want, do what I want to do, receive worldwide recognition, being beautiful. Say what you want about taking a break from social media but you don‚Äôt understand how much I need to see it. It makes me despise myself even more than I really did. I keep a compilation of these things and dedicate a self-inflicted, mental torture session sometimes. 

Everywhere I look, I see no reason to give it my time of day. I see no reason to live. I hate everything. It seems childish but at its core, I hate everything. Everyday, I wake up cursing because I have to go through this again. The dissatisfaction. The envy. 

I want to die and I‚Äôm tired. I know I‚Äôm the problem. But I don‚Äôt care.

No friends, no career (even though I busted my ass in college to graduate Summa Cum Laude), no love, no money, no talent, no home of my own, no kids, and no joy. What I have plenty of is lonliness, anxiety, fear, debt, low self esteem, poor mental and physical health, below average attractiveness.

I'm tired of the phony phrases like, ""it's always darkest before the dawn"", or ""dust yourself off and get back in the saddle"" or some other nonsense. My whole life has been dark! When is MY dawn?

I didn't know that was going to happen in that chapter, he likes horror things but this was something strong, I care a lot about his well-being and how he will face his life positively, the question is about my current compulsion and anxiety thinking: what if My brother takes a knife like in the chapter and murders the family, my brother will become a murderer because of me for showing him this chapter, for exposing him to that cartoonish violence? Is he going to recreate what he saw? Am I a bad influence on him?

"I have felt like this since the last year of middle school but didn‚Äôt pay much attention to it as I thought this feeling of emptiness would dissapear shortly.

It started out with me always feeling like I haven‚Äôt done ‚Äúenough‚Äù school-wise during the last few months before summer break even though I had a nearly perfect GPA.

I have been bullied mercelessly troughout the years because and was on edge the entire school year because I was so excited to finally  leave these idiots behind and have a fresh start in hs.
The final day of 8th grade finally came and I felt absolutely nothing except resentment and anger even though I was supposed to be happy that it was finally over.
I didn‚Äôt even want to  say goodbye to the teachers that were kind to me and actually ‚Äútried‚Äù to help me during these years of torment.

I spent most of my summer sleeping till twelve in the afternoon,crying and moping around.

I distanced myself from my one and only friend, even blocked their number.I also  lost my abillity to draw, come up with ideas and even socialize.
Nothing interests me anymore.

My dear mother has let me know multiple times that everyone would be happier if I finally jumped.
Though everytime she swears that she could have never said something like that of course.

I finished my first year of hs now and nothing really changed except the bullying part.People just treat me like a little lost dog now lol.

I feel like I‚Äôm a rotting corpse at the fresh age of 16.

I like gaming and writing but I'm too tired to do any of that once those three things have been finished. I'm improving but I still struggle a lot mentally and physically. Medication helps somewhat and therapy is... okay. 

What I don't understand is the phrases on the wall about the therapist keeping info private. 

Like: It will remain a secret unless you have thoughts of hurting yourself/others or given permission that it's okay to share. I... have those thoughts a lot and it wasn't taken super seriously. 
""If you don't have a plan of doing it, then it's okay.""

Like, bitch! This is fucking serious! Why are you not taking any action?!

They don't give me advice. They just say try [specific thing] during the week, which... I don't follow through. When I tell them things, they're always like 
""Gotcha"" or ""I understand"". 

It honestly just frustrates me since it took so long to actually get into therapy and I can't go by myself. I'm kinda lost in what to do.

"I(24m) was lost and broken and just lost the person closest to me. I went to visit my professor (45f) after graduation. I haven't seen her in 5 years.
I was writing her a novel.

She was the only person in the world that could snap me out of depression. At this point not even love could. She knew I was living with my lone grandmother. One day she had a stroke and I had to leave town. I was so sad I may never get to see my prof again. But I held on the hope that she would get better. There was that voice at the back of my head telling me that something bad had happened to the prof. 

It turned out true her mother died and she was all alone. I promised to always visit. 

I got severe depression because i couldn't handle seeing the my hero this broken. I decided to be her hero and make her happy.

I visited several time with gifts, agreed I would help her with researches. I visited once and then she told me to come again the following day even calling me son.

I went and a friend of hers (that doesnt know me) humiliated me for being unemployed and made fun of everything even saying that she would report me for harassment if I ever came again. All this while my prof played dumb or joked at my expense.

She knew how much she meant to me and still did that. I started flipping out knowing that she will have to cut me off to preserve her image being a single woman and all.

And it was true she now wouldn't even talk to me in the street or would very aggressive leaving while I am talking.


This has made me spiral into a lot of sexual or that I am into older women and violent thoughts, therapy didn't help and nothing is getting better it has been a year.

My brain is forcing me to either fix it somehow or end myself. And I know she isn't worth it either.

yesterday, i had one of the worst panic attacks ever. it happened at 2:00 am-ish and i woke my mom up because it was so bad.

a few minutes into the panic attack she kept telling me stuff like ""get off your phone"" ""do something else"" ""i don't understand why this is happening to you.  you get everything you want"" bla bla bla.  i felt sad as hell but i slept it off

i woke up the next morning and the energy between me and my mom changed.  it felt distant and she looked, sad.  i asked her ""why do you look so sad?"" and she told me ""my husband's already a crazy man, and even you are crazy too.  i hate myself.  everything was a mistake."".  

i don't know what to do anymore.  it's not like i can control whatever my mind thinks, what my mind does to me, &amp; what my mind manifests in my body.  i just want to kill myself so she wouldn't have to care for me anymore.  i love my mom, she's the best person i've ever known and maybe me committing suicide would be the best option for me and her.

"I've been depressed since high school, and it seems I can't catch a break.

 I live with my step mother and step father in the literal middle of nowhere (my bio mom died in childbirth and then my bio dad remarried to my step mother and they both got custody of me, but then my dad died and my step mother got to keep custody and she remarried fairly recently) and I've been struggling with unemployment and housing crises due to serious health issues that have been ruining my life for five years.

I applied for disability (with my health issues, its a guarantee I'll get approved) in order to help with the unemployment, but it's taking forever to get back. I've been jobless for two years and my unemployment finally ran out this month.I have no car and the nearest town to get a job is 74 minutes away. I literally have no idea how I'm going to feed me or my cat for the next two weeks. 

I don't know how I'm doing anything or even operating at this point, to be honest. It's a lot worse than I'm going to reveal on Reddit to strangers, because, even though this is a throw away account, I feel so much shame in my current situation.

I don't know how much longer I can stay living with my step parents, because my step father makes all these sexual comments about my body and has even laid his hands on me on a couple of occasions, and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I spend all day in my bedroom now and rarely leave except at night. At night I sneak down the hall to the kitchen and eat whatever little food I have left. I tried talking about it to my aunt (step mother's sister) about it, but she tried to sway me against it and she's the only other family member I have in contact with.

I have no friends here. I have no real support system. I'm just day in day out living with the chronic dread that I

1) am disabled

2) don't have a job/can't have a job

3) have to deal with my disgusting step father, and 

4) am cooped up in a bedroom all day in fear, because I don't want to even see my step father.

But even so, I'm just still emotionally exhausted and I don't think I could go on a day without worrying abt something. It's justs my mind been active quite a lot. Even if they're also there for me I just don't feel them at all. As well as things like I used to find it fun doesn't even excite me anymore. Overtime, I think everything build's up which it gets harder for me to express my needs to people.

"Hi all,

I have been struggling with Depression and likely Anxiety for 20+ years, but in the past 10 it has gotten worse. There was a point where I was relapsing into deep depression 4 to 5 times a year that took a month or more to recover from. I was doing a little better, but now I am dealing with something I am not sure how to handle.

It first happened a few months ago on a work trip. I had just finished up for the day and was looking forward to getting back to my room to relax and watch a movie. I got into my room and sat on the side of the bed, and then it started. The best way I can describe it was a heat starting in my feet and slowly rising, as it moved up my body I could feel all of the concerns I usually struggle with during depression creep its way back in to my mind. I couldn't control it and that scared me which of course made things worse. It took a week for me to get back to myself. 

I am struggling through the fallout of the the same thing now. I again was just relaxing and it started to come over me in the same way. I am someone who does a lot of research when I struggle with things, and I think these might be panic attacks? 

The thing that scares me is that I can not seem to stop them. I try breathing exercises, meditation, exercise, but I can't stop it. I am on meds for depression, Sertraline and buspirone, but I am at a loss for how to control this or at least prevent it. Any ideas or help?

I left a 3 year relationship a few months ago because I kept falling in and out of depressive episodes leading to the decline of the relationship. During the end also realized I felt trapped with her. I loved her more than any person but being constrained was creating more unhappy feelings than she was creating happy ones. The irony felt cruel. I always love a good excuse to self destruct, so I did and I left her right after. 

Now I'm with someone else. She's poly, and I guess I am now too. I tried so hard to be friends with my ex but she found out I rebounded and now she told me she never wants to speak to me again.

I don't know if I want to punish myself or if I want validation but it's bothering me a lot and I don't know what to do. Thanks for reading.",0
"Hi guys. My name is E and I‚Äôm currently 24 years old. Been severely depressed for as long as I can remember. Been through various rounds of medications, therapies, hospitalizations, the whole thing. I don‚Äôt understand why I am the way that I am. Growing up I never struggled, at least financially. I feel guilty for my illness. My parents never deserved to have to put up with me. Now that I‚Äôm an adult, things are even worse despite my medication I‚Äôve been on consistently for over 2 years. Everyday is the same. I‚Äôm deteriorating mentally but don‚Äôt have the heart to handle it. I turned to Reddit because I feel like a burden to the ones around me and to the ones who know me. Maybe here I can find the support I need without being a waste of time to the ones who‚Äôve tried to help. Anyone else feel this way? ",0
"The title covers everything.
I feel helpless. Can't even afford to kill myself cause my parents will come on to the streets. Being a hemophilia patient body pains and the ability to live a healthy life is not something I can see happening. Been bullied and kicked down by everyone cause they know I can't fight back even if I want to. Worked for 3 years at company and then lost it. Everyone I knew are better off with a busier life. Waking up everyday is just agony. I try to keep pushing through everyday doing what I can to turn my life around but most days I don't want to keep on going. I don't know what to do.",0
"It‚Äôll be quick, i just need to say how much i‚Äôm disappointed of myself. We had two exams and the results came back today, i didn‚Äôt get the average score to succeed. On both exams.

I just feel like even if i work till my brain falls off, i‚Äôll still not be enough. I‚Äôm so sick of this.When i‚Äôm trying to get better and do better, it just doesn‚Äôt work.",0

How do I find motivation to go to work and socialize when all I want to do is stay home and hide from the world? Ever since my mom died I‚Äôve felt like a child again. ,0
"I feel like a failure, like a whining toddler but holy molly, I just don't wanna live anymore. Every day is so exhausting and pointless. Wake up, put on clothes, go to work, hate work, earn money that will never buy me the things I want, return home smelly and filthy, shower, eat microwaved processed garbage because I don't have the will to cook real food anymore, try to numb myself out with media, sleep. Every day, for the last 10 or so years. And its not like things were better when I was a kid, life was different but it still sucked. I'm 25 and statisticly iv got what, another 60ish years of this? I don't wanna do that. I don't wanna live like this another week let alone another few decades. I'm holding on because I don't want my grandparents to be sad, and I have to take care of my cats, but when both of those things are gone idk how long I'll make it. I don't wanna die but this isn't living. I don't wanna do this anymore. How much longer do I have to be in pain?",0
I‚Äôd like to say it gets easier but really it just gets more manageable. I‚Äôve been taking meds for a long time and it keeps the constant sadness at bay. I do have a lot in my life that makes me happy and that is what sucks because sadness will always win out no matter how wonderful my life can be. It‚Äôs always been like this and I‚Äôve talked to therapists and read books and they help but depression is always standing by. Everybody here understands and some are really struggling. Helping each other out is the best we can all do.,0
"I'm 23M. Long story short, I had a best friend when I was in early childhood and honestly that was the best part of my life. But then he moved away and although I had some friends after, none really ever came close to him. I just felt so loved and special around him, but he moved away so soon.

I experienced some neglect too. There were times in my life where the only peers my age I got to see were like once a week on Sundays for 3 hours at most. It really sucked. Apparently I hung out with my neighbors multiple days a week for years for most of elementary according to my mom, but I don't remember. I trust my mom but maybe she doesn't remember? Idk. I'm worried I only saw them once a week at most. Is that normal? I guess she probably remembers just fine.

I wish I could've gone to sports. I wish I could've seen other kids my age every day like the public schoolers got to do. I wish we had more money to do fun stuff with my friends. I wish I got to have a big birthday party with my best friend and a bunch of other people. I wish I could've gone to prom. I wish I could've had a sleepover (with close friends that actually liked me). I wish I could've seen my friends every day in summer and did summer stuff, even if it was just one friend.

I was such a lonely child. This probably sounds pathetic but in middle school I used to pretend I had a little brother and he'd sit with me in the car and talk and we'd cuddle.

Why do I always have to be alone? Why do the people closest to me always have to go? I don't mind having responsibilities or do adult things but all my friends wanna get married, but I'm not ready to move to that stage of life.

I just want to be as close to someone like a little brother like I could've been in childhood.

I don't hate my life. I love my life. I never asked for a perfect life I just asked for someone special to be with.

Is it too late for me? Can I still have a close best friend that I can see every day? I just want a best friend like I used to have, and have them be in my life for longer than a short period of time. I just want to feel that close to someone again. It'd even be nice to have a close group of friends. I never asked for a perfect life, just one where I had someone special.

I'm scared that even if I did get a best friend, that it just wouldn't be the same as it would've been back then. That they'll act too ""old"" and ""mature"", and that there won't be as much fun stuff to do because no one really cares about young adults as much.

"I went on a trip today and forgot to take my medication (citalopram and brintellix) and felt weird throughout the entire day.

When I'd move, I'd occasionally feel disconnected from my body and feel a 'jolt' of sorts. It was always very disorienting.

It would always be gone the next second, but it'd happen often enough for me to take notice of it. 

Is this normal or should I be worried?

"So to summarize yesterday my friend and I had a conversation about his self harm and suicide attempts, and I proposed him an idea of talking a supportive part of his family to get through the current wave of his depression, but he started to deny that he even has it, and said that he has no reason to be depressed. I pointed out the beatings he's received throughout his childhood and the mental abuse more recently, yet he continued to deny it, saying that he was feeling like that for a long time. As we talked he just continued to give me more agruments in my favor, yet denying that he has depression and refusing to talk to anyone.  
  
I'm not sure how to convince him that his situation is serious and that he should get help. And I'm looking for general advice on how to help someone with depression. Also originally my plan for this post was to post the screenshots of our conversation, but then I found out this subreddit doesn't allow images, so now I don't know what to do with them.",0

"I‚Äôve experienced this with people I‚Äôve only known for a while, and people I‚Äôve known for years. It seems like people just love to play with my emotions, make me think we‚Äôre still friends and on good terms but in reality they wouldn‚Äôt blink an eye if something happened to me, they ignore me and any attempts to communicate, and only initiate contact with me if they need something. It makes me hate myself even more than I already do. What did I do wrong? Why did you stop liking me and enjoying my company? What is wrong with me? Should I even be here anymore if everyone‚Äôs just gonna treat me like I‚Äôm disposable anyway? And the sad thing is, I still hold love for those people. Because I yearn for when they justify themselves and apologize, which is a far away dream. ",0
"I've been searching for a new job for months now and every job i ever applied for has been doing nothing but just straight up ignoring me...no interviews or anything they all just turn me down...and then i tried getting into walmart, i thought my life was gonna turn for the better.

I really don't want that...but it seems like nowadays i don't have much of a choice in the matter...",0
"And I know it's not good. I know I need to let go of the pain in order to start getting better. I've already healed a lot since I was removed from my traumatic circumstance, but part of me always holds onto a bit of that resentment towards the world. 

Nobody has experienced exactly what I went through because no two people have the same exact feelings and experiences. In a way, that brings me comfort. It is not something I have to or can share with anyone else. It is 100% ""me"", 100% ""fine"", so I keep that bitterness so that sometimes I can just...be angry. I can be angry at the world and nobody else can feel that same anger and for once I feel like a complete individual. For once I don't have to share something. 

I don't know. Maybe I need some sort of ego death. It's strangely cathartic though. My pain is mine and nobody else can have it and something about that feels good, even if it always ends up hurting me. 

It must be part of the depression, right? I don't know if anyone else feels this way, though. ",0
"i got eating disorder and my parents aren't really doing something, im not eating a lot and i lost 20 kilos without doing sports, i really need help",0
"I‚Äôve lived a pretty isolated life, I was never physically abused but entirely emotionally neglected and strongly ignored by family my entire childhood (and most of my adulthood)

I was taken out of school at around 1st grade and my parents never put me back in so my education stopped there and I developed social anxiety and basically hid away in the run down bedroom at the back of our house all my childhood, I remember going days at a time never even seeing my family because of there work schedule and everyone just left me to my devices so I was alone there.

Around the age of 18 my father died and I kinda realized maybe I should try to do something with my life which started the long process of simply becoming a person, I straight didn‚Äôt even know how to tie my shoes till I was like 19, never needed to know and as kid it‚Äôs not like that was too on the to do list over playing PlayStation for instance.

I only ever learned spell half legibly because people in online games used to make fun of me for it and I got tired of it.

The point being I know nothing, I‚Äôve done nothing, and I have no one.

I‚Äôve been making a huge effort to be better, especially these last few years, I got a job I really like and wanted to learn more and do more in this field so I restarted my education, I got tired of being a fat piece of shit so I started trying to loose weight, I got tired of being alone so I started trying to date or just meet people who actually want to hear me speak or care about me in some way.

None of it‚Äôs really working, just kinda stagnating in stress of trying to do anything.

I turn 29 in less than a month and I‚Äôm just nothing, just here for no reason I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth the trouble of doing all this to maybe be a mediocre person when I am 40 and about to die of the heart disease gifted to me by my dads side of the family.

The job I have offers an EAP that I‚Äôve debated calling but I truly just can‚Äôt deal with telling another person about my problems just to either listen to them pretend to give a shit or just literally watch there eyes glaze over as they wait for me to stop talking.

I don‚Äôt even know why I‚Äôm writing this, maybe just to get some of the venom out, I don‚Äôt really know anymore ",0

"I'm a fucking failure at everything.

I gotta go to this fucking graduation party of one of my best friend.

She's one of the most beautiful and emotionally connected person i have. She is the only one that saw me crying beside my parents when i was little.

I want her, i want her in my life but she has a boyfriend and that kills me everytime. I'm gonna see them kissing and hugging hand have a great time, while i got no one that loves me romantically. Then im gonna go home with the realization that she is being fucked by this guy while i try to sleep but cant.

I failed my work, i failed my university because i don't wanna do shit in my life. No girl ever wanted me and im a failure socially.

All I'm gonna see is fucking happy people living their life while im rotting inside full of sadness and hate. I just want to die, take my father grenade, go to the forest with my car, leave it there and blow my head. No pain, and all problems solved.

Fuck this im out, i wanna go out, in tired and fucking hateful all the time and seeing people live, while im 21 and i never lived one day in my life makes me really want to go out.

Fuck fuck this stupid life.",0

Now, I feel that my body is in a lot of pain because I've neglected taking care of it.

My mom recently found out that my father has been seeing another woman, I already knew this a long time ago but I didn‚Äôt know what to do I was afraid to tell my mother because I know it would hurt her and I was still young at that time. My father has been a responsible father, he provided us food, a great house, he spoilt us with many gifts and gives us decent amount of money, but I think it‚Äôs really painful for my mother because she was trying to do her best to become a good wife, she provided him love and support but he just ignores it. I‚Äôm gonna leave for college because I‚Äôll be studying at another region about 1000km, I am really excited to leave because I felt that staying in our house was really intoxicating, my mom would always compare me to my older sister, she would always remind me that I am different than my classmates, (I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder) she keeps telling me that I should really be organized and responsible which made me felt incapable of doing and achieving higher dreams since I am being constantly reminded that I can‚Äôt do it cause I‚Äôm different, she also has her favors on my sister, she always prioritize my sister and praise how good she is and that I should be like her, I tried to be like her once, I remember during my 8th grade I really worked hard to achieve with high honors because I always saw them really proud at my sister, my father even wears his uniform on the stage(he‚Äôs a police officer) but at the time of my recognition, nobody came, so I told my teacher I wasn‚Äôt feeling well and left, even at my high school graduation I felt really bad cause I asked them to come for my graduation it was only about 4 hours but my father left early and my mother was in a hurry, she keeps calling me that we should go home but I told her if she could wait for a moment cause I was still taking pictures with my classmates whom I would be leaving cause I‚Äôll be studying in another region but she left anyways. I really envied how the other parents hold their children with pride in their eyes. In my sister‚Äôs graduation my father took 4 days off to come visit my sister, my mother was prouder than ever, I kept asking myself my graduation only lasted 4 hours and they even couldn‚Äôt wait for me, what is it that my sister have and I don‚Äôt? It really hurts me how they give so much importance at my sister but I guess she deserves it cause she‚Äôs smart, brave and confident and I think it‚Äôs because she was born first, my mother would always tell me that I should respect and prioritize her, I remember we transferred to our new house, me and my sister picked the same room but it was given to her cause she was the eldest and naturally eldest gets whats the best, my sister was leaving to study at another region in a few months but I didn‚Äôt argue cause younger siblings should always submit and respect their parents and older sibling/s. I didn‚Äôt hate them for that though, I was still grateful that I have a roof under my head, I have food at the table and I was able to study. Now that I‚Äôm in college I‚Äôm ready to leave and chase my dreams but I worry about my mother what if she and my father would fight, she would be all alone and I can‚Äôt let that happen, I know how it feels to be alone, to succumb in a dark place where everthing feels useless and pointless to the extent that you just want to end it all. So please help me, tell me what to do, do I follow my dreams and study at another region where I could heal myself? or should I stay and with my mother so that she could heal herself?",0

"When I was little, around 7 or 8 years old, I used to get this... sensation. I'd be lying in bed in the dark and I would get almost a mental image of a ball of dots in my chest. But I'd be frozen in place, my mind would be in chaos. I'd hear my parents or the TV outside, life going on as normal around me, and the ball would start expanding. I felt like it was trying to burst out of me. And I had to ""eat"" it to keep it under control; I had to keep taking huge gulps of air because that's what would make the ball smaller. And I never got it to disappear; I think I just fell asleep from exhaustion. I don't remember thinking anything, just trying to make the ball stop growing.

I've been grappling with my sanity for a few hours now, and I feel mentally the experience is the same as when I was a child. The same feeling of chaos, the attempts at control but now it's trying to think happy thoughts, watching videos to distract myself, belittling myself so I get a grip. The same notion that if I don't have it under control, something really bad will happen. To think about it, it ends the same way as well; eventually giving in to exhaustion with my mind still fried.

It's almost like having a fever, I feel so consumed by this 'pain' in my head. I know even when I'm spiraling and weeping tears and going on a rant about how disgusting I am, how I want to die, how messed up everything is, I know I'm ""going through it"".

As a child, I knew there was something wrong with me. Now, I identify it as depression and feelings of anxiety, misery, anger, foreboding, confusion, guilt, shame, disgust, like a whole mess of things. Mental health wasn't a thing in the country I live in, so my parents just assumed I had a stick up my ass and wanted to be difficult. To be fair to them, I used to do this thing where I'd swallow my food without chewing... I really wanted to die even back then.

But I'm curious, is this an actual thing, or was I incredibly messed up?",0

"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",1
"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",1

Life as a black man with a small penis (6 inches) is depressing. Especially when I‚Äôve had to turn down countless women because of my size. I finally met a girl I was comfortable with and she has been my girlfriend for a while. We got into an argument a little while ago and out of anger she said something about my penis being small. She has apologized and said she didn‚Äôt mean it but I think she just doesn‚Äôt want to hurt my feelings. Our relationship hasn‚Äôt been the same since and I‚Äôve been thinking about ending it. I‚Äôm the only person she‚Äôs ever had sex with and she still said I was small. The only other woman I‚Äôve been with was only oral sex and she also told multiple people I was small and that pushed me to the point where I was suicidal. I‚Äôm trying my hardest to see a positive side but there is none. Having a small penis has made my life not even worth living. I‚Äôm 24 and I‚Äôm thinking about giving up on love all together. This will probably go unnoticed‚Ä¶It‚Äôs a rough life for us guys with a small one. If you cared enough to read thank you so much.,1
"I feel like the worst daughter in the world right now. my mum found my suicide note and read it the whole way through. there was a lot of very sensitive information on there. she thought I was dead and I had left it for her to find, and had to call up my work to check I was alive. 

safe to say I'm in a lot of distress right now. I have no idea how I was stupid enough to leave it somewhere she could find. I feel so guilty. Her reaction has made me even more scared to follow through with it, which I'm sure if I were rational right now I'd see as a good thing.

Depression  
Not good enough at academics  
Heartbreak (not mentioned in any post)

  
I thought about this for a while, and I realized that I can fix all of this.  
I can continue my healing from depression and I might overcome it, I can just study more slowly and maybe hire a tutor. 

Additionally, having experienced heartbreak numerous times before, I have grown familiar with it and can now move on more easily.

"My ex (wlw relationship for context) was arrested for felony DV. I was the victim. She hit me with a truck and gave me a traumatic brain injury. I have permanent brain damage for the rest of my life. She attacked me with a knife, she called me r*tarted knowing I‚Äôm diagnosed autistic, she said I deserved to be r*ped. A lot of it I have on video. I even have her on video confessing to the abuse and saying if I told anyone she‚Äôd k*ll herself or me. She got away with the abuse a lot because I would call the cops and she‚Äôd attempt suic*de so they‚Äôd have to take her to the hospital instead of arresting her. She used her mental illnesses as an excuse for her behavior. She blamed it on bpd and schizophrenia. She even blamed me. She got probation and they will remove the felony once she completes probation. I feel completely robbed of justice. I live in constant mental and physical pain from what she did. Everyone is telling me to move on but it‚Äôs hard when my disabilities SHE GAVE ME affect me every day. I want to just die and end this. She‚Äôs broken the restraining order multiple times and the cops won‚Äôt do anything. 

She manipulated me for so long like saying it was my fault for getting hit with the truck bc I ran after my car after she stole it but I was on the side walk.  Doesn‚Äôt matter if I was doing backflips on the side walk if you run off the road and ran someone down on the side walk that‚Äôs your fault yk? She said it was my fault she stabbed me with a knife bc she was trying to off herself not me. She‚Äôs telling everyone I was the problem.  Even despite it being on video and her being found guilty in criminal, civil, and military court she STILL won‚Äôt take responsibility. It‚Äôs so hard to move on when someone is doing stuff like that and won‚Äôt even acknowledge what they did. 

I have nightmares about her.  Every night she‚Äôs haunting my dreams. Sometimes I dream she apologizes, and that‚Äôs when I know it‚Äôs just a dream.  

I want to die I want to end this suffering. I hate myself for staying with her for so long. I hate what she did and what she continues to do. Yet I still mourn the life I dreamed of having with her.  To top it all off the trauma of that made me develop bipolar disorder. Fml ",1
"Another meaningless day in a meaningless world. I was driving my dads car today and I saw these people in theirs 60s, wandering aimlessly on this random campsite. OMG, it made me so depressed. Who the fuck wants to grow old? 

I was planning on doing something ""stupid"" today, but my survivalinstinct kicked my deathwish's ass again. 

There is no painless way out of this. Maybe a Heroin/Fentanyl/Morfin overdose, but still, it's going to be a lot of fear involved. Also, if you fail to overdose, there is a high chance of addiction and a fucked up future.

OMG, I'm sick of this shit. Food tastes like ash now. I've had thousands of orgasms and I'm honestly getting a bit bored off it. Drugs don't interest me much anymore and I hate being sober (it's boring as fuck). 

I love my family and my family loves me back (just as it supposed to be). It's sad to say, but I'm starting to feel a bit numb on the receiving end. 

I still remember Chester Bennington. He was such a good singer and a beacon of light to all the emos in the world. It's so easy to relate to Linkin Park. Everybody loved Chester, but he was so depressed. It seemed like he had no love for himself. 

Depression is a Beast. It sucks all joy out of life.

"I don't really know how to start this post or why I even came to this platform, but I've been feeling so trapped and helpless over the past few months and wanted to share my situation. For some background, I'm a 17 year-old male, and my mind is essentially in a permanently blank, withdrawn, depersonalised and dissociative slate, like I'm watching my life as a movie, drifting through it on autopilot. Everything and everyone around me feels lifeless and foggy. I feel completely detached from my body and surroundings, as if I'm not really alive.

It's hard to explain, but everything feels disconnected and distant, like living in a permanent state of amnesia where I'm detached from my own body, lacking thoughts, memories, or a sense of identity, like an ego death that never ends. This has severely impacted my social abilities; I don't converse or speak with absolutely anyone at all. At college, I always stay by myself and avoid any social interaction. I'm incapable of having basic conversations because absolutely nothing is happening in my mind. I'm permanently zoned out, with nothing to say or express, and trying to find something to say is extremely difficult.

I can't explain anything about what I do at college because I'm zoned out and withdrawn the entire time I'm on campus, and I don't remember anything the next day. The only reason I'm doing relatively well is that I've been studying all the information at home. I'm essentially in a constant dream-like state and don't really think about anything. I don't speak at all. I cannot explain my situation to medical professionals; when I try, I just sit in silence, unable to convey my problems because I'm permanently zoned out. My mind is empty, and I'm entirely withdrawn. I feel crazy writing this. Am I going crazy? Am I going I mentally insane?

I feel so lost and alone. It took me a long time to write this Reddit post, and even as I typed, I felt withdrawn and can't really recall what I've talked about. I don't want to live like this anymore; it pains me to see people around me, reminding me of the life and self I can no longer get back.

I am extremely depressed and can't find joy in this life anymore. I have suicidal thoughts regularly. I do not want to continue this existence at all. I have absolutely nothing to say or express anymore. It gives me pain knowing this will probably be how I live for the next few years, and I can't bear the thought of living like this any longer.",1

I can't accept that this is what life is about. Just working all the time and barely having any time to rest. I already feel dead inside. Everyone around me seem like they're okay with living like this and I just can't. 

I hate being a woman. It's the worst. I hate having to deal with monthly periods, cramps and mood swings. I hate being valued only for my looks and having the pressure to always look pretty. I hate how the world expects too much of me as a woman.

"I developed tinnitus a couple of weeks ago and it is already driving me insane. I hear a constant loud, high-pitched ringing in my ears (worse in my left ear). I have sensory issues and used to wear noise cancelling headphones to deal with overstimulation; silence was integral to being emotionally regulated and preventing meltdowns. Now, I can never have silence, and I have to have constant sound to try to drown out the tinnitus but it's so loud that it's hard to block it. I'm like an exposed nerve 24/7. I'm not sleeping more than a couple hours a night if I'm lucky. I'm dysregulating constantly. I'm struggling to look after myself or to work. I'm scared I'll lose my job or have to quit because I can't function. 

I don't have family, so I need to be able to look after myself in every way. But I'm struggling so bad. 

It's like the final nail in the coffin on top of everything else. I also have EDS and live with daily pain and frequent injuries. I have anxiety and depression. I'm a survivor of childhood abuse and neglect. I'm very isolated and only have my partner and one real friend. Being autistic already made life quite difficult. 

On top of it all, I'm actually Catholic and suicide is a sin to us, so I'm torn between the impulse to end my life just to get away from the tinnitus and the fear of going to Hell. And of course, there is the catholic guilt from contemplating suicide. ",1

2. Been applying for months now but there‚Äôs nothing but rejection. Apparently, they choose from top tier business school graduates now and the job market is just pure shite atm.
3. Barely saved anything

We had a misunderstanding and I don‚Äôt know her well at all so you‚Äôd think it doesn‚Äôt really matter, but as she began posting with friends and about her confident mentality it made me realize I don‚Äôt have any of those things. I don‚Äôt have friends, a support system, someone I can confide in when I need to just let out my emotions. I‚Äôm stuck with my thoughts alone all day long, especially now since it‚Äôs summer.

I‚Äôm about to be 18 soon and I‚Äôve never been to a party, spoken to someone romantically, been to a friends house, or even hung out with anyone outside of school. I‚Äôm usually okay with being alone and until recently I never seemed to realize how much I‚Äôve been avoiding acknowledging it, because I thought it was something to be prided in. The only good days I‚Äôve had were from in my childhood, which even then I was struggling so badly. My mother and my sister struggle with mental health issues and while being abused as a child and trying to figure out why this was happening to me, I was simultaneously having to support my mother and sister the best I could. My mother has grown from that and apologized for her actions, we have a great relationship now but nothing has changed from them needing my support. I just miss when I could wake up and not worry. I‚Äôm soon going to have to worry about college, jobs, death, adulthood, etc. My heart is heavy every day I wake up.

"Well, periodically I end up posting back here, whenever I feel like things getting better, shit always end up hitting the fan somehow.

I'm convinced that we are just brought into this planet to make other's lives miserable for no reason. If my own family isn't willing to support the real me, how can I be sure that the rest of people will accept me?

Whenever I find a semblance of happiness, there's always some douchbag gleefully awaiting the moment to take that from me. The idiot of my father doesn't have empathy for me and still claims that he loves me. I didn't get to choose to be born the way I am, I didn't have a choice about the decisions I took. It was either ""that"" or killing myself, thing that I'm really considering again.

I've been dealt a shitty hand and people around me have somehow made my hand worse. If my experiences taught me something, it's that transitioning isn't hell, people around you make it seem like hell.

So picture this, you need to get over your own dysphoric thoughts and also tolerate the insensitive comments of the people that are supposed to love you the most.

I'm stuck living as a dude while doing hrt and my fucking environment won't let me to socially transition. Fucking conservative Catholics, I despise them, they literally put my family against me with their idiotic ideologies. For them I'm nothing more than a dude wanting to wear dresses or a weirdo.

If I could just move out I would have done it by now, but my salary is so shitty and rents are so ludicrously high that that's not an option. I feel trapped in my own body and trapped by my environment, I just want out.

I'm so depressed that I would gladly take my life or someone else's in the process. I'm so angry and resented at everything that I would like to watch the whole world burn.

I wouldn't wish my situation upon anyone, it's literal torture and also to add insult to injury, I was ""suggested"" to leave hormones for a year. Do you know how that would affect me? I would literally snap faster as my mental health would take an even worse nosedive. I've tried it before so I know by personal experience that it's a terrible idea.

So to wrap up my torture porn biography, I may end up or being homeless or deleting myself. Idk, at this point I don't care, I just want to be left alone.",1

"I just can't fucking live with this. Life just keeps reinforcing how fucking worthless i am. I just wanted to have a normal life in high school and college. Make friends, find love, go together to parties, on vacation, have sex.

 But no, i'm just a worthless loser. I spent so much time reaching out to people only to get ignored or dismissed with cheap excuses. Year after year. The only woman who ever gave me some positive attention ended up taking advantage of me and abusing me for months. And she was taunting me non stop about how women can get anyone these days and men should just bend over backwards to appease them. 

That's the only thing i'm good for. She was nice as long as i was simping for her. My friends only talk when they need something. Got taken advantage of many times since then. Got told many times how much of a loser i am since then. My mother told me i'm the type of guy women settle down with when they turn 30 and look for someone ""reliable"": has a job, owns a house, ""talks very little but listens a lot"". That's all i'm useful for. 6 years of self improvement changed absolutely nothing about it. Couldn't even have sex like a normal fucking age. At best i'll be just one of those meek loser ""late bloomers"". Another weakness for people to pick up on and exploit me. 

Nobody ever supports me. Everybody i tried talking to is just annoyed. Get therapy, stop whining, focus on some hobbies. My former ""friend"" also told me to fuck hookers if i have to. I've been doing that for two years ever since i started working full time. It didn't make me happy. Not at all. Just more bitter that my family is satisfied they finally made me shut the fuck up and cope. 

I just don't want to live anymore. I've been suicidal for two years and nothing gets better. My youth is gone. My high school experience is gone. My college experience is gone. I'll never catch up because i'm too busy working and i'm still the same loser i always was. Even if i did, i'll have the joy of getting that teenage experience 10 years late as a bitter and broken adult. What's the point in it now? My abusive friend won. My family won. 6 years later i'm exactly the man they wanted me to be. I just don't give a shit. This life is just worthless. Every night before sleep i think of how much i want this to finally end.

"I first became depressed at 12, and was first planning to kill myself on the day before my 13th birthday. The thoughts are never gone. They lessened in high school, but got much worse in university. My first attempt (and soon after, multiple) was eventually in university. I think that it's because I was in the wrong major (besides the inherent negatives in life that would always be there). 

I have graduated now, currently doing nothing at home. I want to study so I can apply and get into university again, thus escaping from home and can try killing myself again. But life is pointless, so why bother studying? I can run away into a hotel and kill myself there anyway. 

One day I realized that I really do want to die, I really want to kill myself, that dying is my life goal, and I accepted this. I finally felt peace again. I realized that I can use my wanted major as a publicly acceptable reason to go away again from home. Other people don't have to know that I'm actually escaping to kill myself. Suddenly I'm much more focused in my studying.

This better work. I must get into that university so I have the freedom to try to kill myself again. Or I can do hotel suicide anyway.

(Suicide is not the only reason for getting into university, there are also concerns with dream major and dream subject, but how this went wrong the first time partly caused my suicidality to get so much worse and I'm mostly hopeless now. If I get there, suicide. If I don't get there, suicide. If anybody hurts me, I remind myself that I'll soon escape and can kill myself there. But if I didn't die, going there is theoretically better than rotting at home surrounded by people who caused this thing in the first place.)",1
"There are so many things going on in my life, no one truly loves or cares about me. My own husband (23m) yells and gets angry with me when I am sad or I cry. He doesn‚Äôt understand, he doesn‚Äôt try to.

I visualize how I could end things. I pray that God will take away my life somehow in an accident or a murder, because I know i don‚Äôt have the strength to do it.

I can‚Äôt leave my husband. In a sick way I don‚Äôt want to. The only way I feel like I can is through dying. He doesn‚Äôt truly love me, and I wish that I had known what I do now before I married him. 

He calls me argumentative when I defend myself, and if I tell him that he says I‚Äôm ‚Äúmanipulative‚Äù. Instead of holding me when I cry or sympathizing with me, he tells me I‚Äôm so emotional or I‚Äôm overacting. I can‚Äôt win. I never will.

"I spent all my childhood in my own mind, playing video games, playing pretend, anxious about OCD thoughts and that manifested in panic attacks and sometimes aggression.  In highschool I had friends all of a sudden.  In college I was depressed because I truly had no idea what to do.  I was gripped by a terror.

The terror went away around when I met my boyfriend.  For 4 years I deluded myself into believing I could go into this niche career with so much socialization required.  But for at least 3 years, I felt so free of the terror.  I could live and play pretend house, dreaming of a future that would never come.  Would we own a dog when we married?  What would we do when we took a trip to Japan?

And now its becoming clearer that this career is not a good fit for me.  Maybe no career is a good fit for me.  And my boyfriend is anxious as I have been on voluntary hold already.  He wants a house and maybe some healthy children that I can‚Äôt give to him due to my genes.  He hasn‚Äôt broken up with me yet, but we have planned on moving soon.

And I kind of want to end it here, in this apartment while he‚Äôs out at work and I can set up a sign to call the police,  instead of subjecting my parents to the horror of it all somewhere down the line.

I don‚Äôt want to go back to inpatient.  They don‚Äôt understand just how fucked up it is to be autistic, to miss everythinng socially.  To be so alone.  ",1
"Hi Everyone, 

I‚Äôm just using this as a way to vent my thoughts on what I‚Äôve been feeling. I don‚Äôt have family or friends. Just me. 

I‚Äôve been stressed out lately on where I am in life. I don‚Äôt have a job, I‚Äôve applied over 800 jobs in finance and I can‚Äôt land one. I have 8 years of experience and I can‚Äôt seem to get through the final stages. Bills are piling on and I can‚Äôt catch a break. 

4 years ago it wasn‚Äôt like this, I was with a long term relationship and a house and a great job and was making $300K a year in banking. 

Then 2 years ago, my mom passed away. Lead me down a a very depressed path. I found my comfort in alcohol and gambling to numb the pain. Emptied my bank accounts and just gave it away to random philanthropy places because I wanted to end my life. 

I ignored and pushed away the love of my life, my friends, and I don‚Äôt have my only family I had which was my mom. 

I live in an apartment that‚Äôs past due by 30 days, and I have no electricity, and I can‚Äôt even land a job. 

Depression is a monster and it‚Äôs 3am and I don‚Äôt know what to do or say or to even think‚Ä¶

"Long story short I attempted suicide by hanging myself two years ago. I got on medication and changed my lifestyle around. In the two years I met someone I really love and moved in with them. Things have recently been rocky in our relationship and I am in debt. I feel lost, I am not being the partner I want to be. I know I won't be able to go through with it this time. I can't abandon my family. My new one or my parents and siblings. I don't want to give my debt to others. 

I can't stop thinking about how peaceful and freeing it would be to stop existing. Hoping I won't wake up, thoughts of how selfish those thoughts are. I know I'll make it through this. I have coping skills now. But the thought loops and spirals are back. Even with therapy.  I don't know if I can talk about this with my therapist because I know I won't go through with it and I can't afford to be sent to the psych ward right now. I'm just venting. I keep mourning the child inside me. That I've failed them somehow.

 That kid with a lot of promise who wanted a fun job and to be able to take care of my family without these toxic traits. I'm in a hole and I'm trying to dig myself out. To be who that child wanted to be. I owe it to them. Go back to college, have my own family. Be able to be a trustworthy parent and partner. Be a pillar of my community. Trying to take it one day at a time but I feel this country has failed it's citizens and I have failed as a human being. 

I hope we all find our peace whatever that may be. ",1
"The whole day today I've been thinking about the fact that I am dirt poor. Literally. But I live in Lesotho so it's no surprise. I had a bursary to go study in a university in South Africa but I couldn't afford to go because it only covered tuition and not accommodation, and even if I did find accommodation I definitely wouldn't afford to get a visa. ""Why don't you just study in Lesotho?"" I simply can't afford to, I can't even afford to buy data bundles most of the time and it's just R20 for 800mb weekly. My family hasn't had access to tap water for three months now because we couldn't afford to pay the bill until the water company cut us off. We don't even have indoor plumbing!! We're still using a pit latrine. I don't think I'd have any education at all if primary education in government funded schools wasn't free. Going to sleep hungry is not a big deal anymore, I've even stopped feeling hunger at this point. My siblings have left this poverty behind, one by one they made it out and never looked back. Still waiting for my breakthrough. I am lowkey suicidal, I wanna die but I am too chicken to actually do it, but I definitely wouldn't mind it if I woke up dead. I've thought of throwing myself in front of a moving truck countless time but I don't want to to traumatize someone else. When I hear of someone who committed suicide I simply admire their bravery lol. And the sad reality is, in this country if you were born poor the odds are already stacked against you and you will most likely die poor. I cannot find a job to save my life, I'm turning 26 in September and the only thing I am yet to try is prostitution. It's all so depressing and I am so tired. ",1

"I‚Äôve come to the conclusion lately that I do not want to live and function as an adult. I shouldn‚Äôt have to have any commitments or responsibilities. I should have died age 7. My life has been downhill since then. 

My parents loved - and still love - me so hard, it makes me hurt inside. I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense? I refuse to look for romantic love because the only people I want to care about are them. The more years I spend masking my true self (because nobody - nobody - would ever suspect I‚Äôm like this; me, the attractive, successful career woman who has bought her own apartment and been living independently for over ten years), the more I want to give it all up and just move back in with them and totally regress. I want to regress to the age I was when I didn‚Äôt know of negative emotions, or anxiety, of grief and loss. I want to be ignorant. I am both saddened and filled with rage that growing up happened. I want it to be just the three of us forever. To play with Barbies with my dad in the garden. I want to see colours as brightly as I used to. I want my mum to hold me tight. The love I experienced in my childhood is like a chokehold. On a bad day, old memories is all I can think about. I cycle through them in my brain and cry until I have no voice left.

Nobody asked me if I wanted to be an adult. Nobody checked with me. I watch my friends get married and have kids and I‚Äôm like why. Why do you want to adult so badly? How sad that you are now taking care of your own children. You should still be children yourselves. Why the fuck are we getting older?

And then, because everyone seems to be going down that path, I start thinking ‚ÄòWhat gene am I missing that I turned out so wrong?‚Äô

I would like to die a dignified death with my parents in a couple of decades‚Äô time. I can hold on till then if I know I get to go with them. I fully intend to end my life as soon as they go, but I am hoping that they might be interested in looking into options of going the three of us at the same time.

"I never post on Reddit, I just lurk, but I feel so hopeless that I'm going to try and post something. If I write something wrong, I am very sorry. 

I have no hope in life right now. I have struggled with depression since I was 9 years old and I recently got my Asperger's diagnosis but even though I am in therapy nothing is helping. I am currently 18 years old and I had to move out when I was 17 because I had to go to another part of the country for vocational training. Since then, everything has been even harder for me. But the worst thing is that I have no future. I finished secondary school (I think that's what it's called in English), but because of my grades, I had to work in really bad jobs. Because of my autism, I can't keep up and I don't know what to do. I am in debt and barely have enough money to eat. My family won't help me, so I just feel so alone and like suicide is the only option left to me, since I have to quit everything I try out. I just want to go back home and go to a normal school again but I wasted every chance for a good life due to my mental health problems.

I have so many other feelings and problems, but I don't want to go into too much detail because it's all a bit complicated lol.

I don't know why I'm even posting here, but I'm hoping someone has some advice or has been in a similar situation, just anything. Sorry if this post is confusing, my whole mind is a mess.

It's more under control now, but I still live everyday in pain. SSRIs, antipsychotics, and benzodiazipines, but they don't do much more than make life barely tolerable. I feel like a failure.

My father has been a very important person to me. He has been a single parent ever since my mother became obsessed with money to the point she turned to drugs and cheated on my father. I have been aware of my dad's struggles to keep the family together, worse now he is in his 60's with my brother with no job.

Now me, an extremely ungrateful son. I take everything for granted even though I believe otherwise. I always get what I wanted, from a new phone to a new PC. But at the end, I forget my dad is a person too. I always reply to him monotonously as if he is not my dad, speaking in a way like I want him gone and just not bother me anyone. I only say thank you when I got what I wanted, I rarely say love you to him. I tried spending time with him because you never know when he's gone but I never did. 

Few hours ago, my dad unlocked my door with a key and asked me if I ate already, I said I already did and to not use the key anymore and just at least knock in a disrespectful tone. I wish I could have said that differently to be honest. He lashed out and said he noticed how disrespectful I have been lately and that he gave everything to me even though he has been struggling at work as a single parent. I couldn't say anything but stare at him from my bed. After that he just slammed my door and left me feeling extremely guilty to the point I intent to k*ll myself that moment, I have constant thoughts of relieving the burden of being a spoiled brat. I grabbed my belt from my closet and tied it to a somewhat n*ose to hang it on a door and hang myself with. I thought of all the things that could happen if I ended it here right now. It could take a while for everyone to grieve, but the burden of having to put up to my shit is not there anymore. It felt like a win for everyone. But the thought of the pain made me hesitate, so I just went to self harm, sliding a small but sharp thread cutter along my arms. It felt liberating, to physically punish myself because no one will. 

Lately I've been struggling mentally, I starved myself as a form of punishment, even self harm. I wanted to run away from everyone, start a new life, a chance to change my disgusting behavior. But I'm still an upcoming college student, (19) no job, barely any savings. Why is it hard for me to accept that I'm extremely fucking lucky to have this life? Why do I have to bring others down? When I see my friends bond with their family, I always get so jealous even though I'm the problem. I really love my dad, but I can't seem to show it or act it.

I don't blame anyone but myself, so why is it hard for me to change my shitty self?

"Tw.Suicide,CSA,Addiction 

I was raped when I was 8 years old. I feel like after that my childhood was over. I don‚Äôt know why it still affects me now. It‚Äôs been more than half of my life. 

Whenever I see or hear things to do with my life before then I cry. I was so happy when I was a small child. 

I wish things could be that way again. If I was never raped my life would be so different. I wouldn‚Äôt be suicidal like I am now. I wouldn‚Äôt have grown up so fast. I would be happy. I would probably not have as bad mental health issues. My whole life could have been different. 

I wouldn‚Äôt still be having nightmares years later. Unable to keep long lasting friendships and relationships. Depending on drugs and alcohol so I don‚Äôt kill myself.

I know I wouldn‚Äôt still be laughing and playing barbies and dress up now but I would‚Äôve naturally. Instead of for some reason just stopping after the trauma. 

I want to be that girl again. I don‚Äôt want to be an adult. I just want to be 7 years old again before my life was ruined. I want to play all day and watch Peppa pig with my sister who didn‚Äôt understand why I wouldn‚Äôt play with her anymore at the time. And I want to collect my little pony figures and draw with wash off glitter tattoo pens with my friends. Before they started to turn on me and bully me because I started to become weird after the trauma.

I never would‚Äôve thought I‚Äôd turn out this way. No one did. I used to be kind and friendly and have morals. Now I steal all the time and have to be on something to cope all the time and I‚Äôm mean to people I care about all the time.

Because of that when they divorced my dad stopped talking to me. It‚Äôs been two years. He has said he knows I haven‚Äôt done anything wrong. But he did it because he was mad at my mom. That‚Äôs how worthless I am to him. I see my siblings live the life I should of had. Friends fun parents care about them. Instead my life was hell from the age of 4 I should of never been born. The only people in my life have, lied on me, beat me, hated me, and treated me like shit. I have no one. I talked to this guy on this app maybe 2 years ago and he went through a lot growing up I bet he would understand but I was too shy to ask for his contact maybe I would of had someone to talk to today. The app is gone I‚Äôll never find that guy again. My auntie ruined my life and it‚Äôs over for me she‚Äôs the most evil person I know everything bad in my life is because of her. She did so much to me she is sick in the head and no one loves me she made sure my parents took me out of school and homeschooled me so I‚Äôm alone I even tried to make friends with someone a year ago because I heard my mom talking to her mom on the phone about how alone and sad she was at her school because she had no friends and was gonna graduate. I was invited to her graduation dinner last month and she ignored me almost the whole time to talk to her new friends and they kept going to the bathroom to talk about me, mostly instigated by her. I only know this because one of them looked at me and said ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs giving me anxiety‚Äù thinking I couldn‚Äôt hear them. Then they all went to the bathroom again this happened 5 times. We both hung out together with our moms with us because we both couldn‚Äôt drive. I thought I made my first friend and she was similar to me but no I didn‚Äôt want to believe bad of her until someone told me yesterday that it had to be what they were doing. I can‚Äôt believe it. I was sad that day because of what I been through in my life and she was talking about me with her buddies so many times. I can‚Äôt believe this is what I get out of life.

I just wanna start on saying im serious on this post, I am actually seeking for help, like therapy tho i dont want to you know? but please give me advice. 

Hi, im Z, i have the thoughts and actions of Inc*st, sorry for the word, but yeah. It all started when I hit puberty, I had this older brother who i put my H*rniness into. I know its so wrong but its so hard to fight the urge. Until now I still do, But just last month, I had just realize its immoral, and such a big sin so i stopped (voyeur), after that, I still had the guts to do actions of Inc*st, I actually had been caught by my older brother, after that we act like nothing happened, we talk the same, we sometimes laugh together, so all goods on that i guess! As of right now, my addiction has been died down (I hope) I just really wanna move on pass by this, I need help. I need advice. Its so immoral i wanna move on. 

I read one Quora answer that its probably just because im young and bc of my hormones, and thats why I put my Older brother in that position, which I guess was true. I had a Mutual Understanding relationship once and I didnt bother to put attention to my Older brother, so i guess its true you know?

I hope you guys wont be harsh on me, Because i am seeking for help and advice on how to move on! I wanna be the best version of myself, to make the LUST go away, I get panic attacks and overall anxiety about it. Need help.",1

"So this is my plan.

I can't die right now. I'm helping my grandpa taking care of my grandma that is close to dying. Also, I need help my nephew getting into college. 

After that, my grandpa will need someone to not be alone.

But after that, I'll be able to rest. 

I once had a lot of dreams. But now I know that it doesn't makes sense, since everybody dies and everyone is in pain.

One of my dreams was to have children. If I really love them, I can't have them. I would infect them with my darkness and void. I wish to travel and know the world - for what?? Whenever I go, I'll be there. Remembering. Missing. I used to like to paint and love mathematics. But my brains seems unable to be creative or to learn anything new for the last few years. 

Now I know that only children, somehow, are able to truly feel happiness. I was a daughter of a addicted and I remember being happy sometimes.",1

"I don't think I ever remember being happy as a kid, so I can't really remember when I first started feeling suicidal, but I do remember the first time I told my step dad that I was suicidal when I was maybe 6 or 7. He just marched me into the kitchen, gave me a knife, and told me to do it. Obviously he was trying to prove that I wasn't really suicidal, but I just felt trapped by my own cowardice. I just lived under the thought that I was better off dead, but too useless to ever make that a reality myself. Time really hasn't helped with that at all. After high school, I went to trade school, did pretty well at first, but then fell into drug abuse and depression and wasted away part of the year. I was back home, without skills to put on paper, no job, and that same sense of uselessness. I made a plan that if by the end of that year, I hadn't made some progress with my life, I'd hike up to a cliff and kill myself. Now I'm on track to get my CS degree, but I still feel like I don't deserve to be alive. It feels like the only reason I don't just find a belt and hang myself over my balcony is because I've got a cat that'd probably miss me. I really don't want to live constantly reminding myself not to kill myself just because I have a cat. I know I need therapy, but I can't afford it. I just don't know what to do.",1

"Hi all,

I seriously considered suicide at 18, but I figured I still had time to turn things around and I believed ppl when they said things will get better. Well, 4 years has passed and I‚Äôm in no better position now. During these four years I focused heavily on self improvement, including learning (for myself), grades(for school), and exercise. I didn‚Äôt go out to parties/clubs at all because I barely made any social connections throughout college. As such, I have no happy memories throughout these last four years. 

I have good grades, am in great shape, and I feel generally satisfied with the knowledge I know. My problem is that none of this helped me in my life. I have little work experience and as such I have no prospects for work. Initially I wanted to go to law school, but I realize now that despite putting so much effort into learning I am only above average at best in my intellect, and I can‚Äôt score very high on my LSAT despite working an ungodly amount of hours on studying for it. Because I can‚Äôt score high on my LSAT I can‚Äôt go to a good law school. My grades are splendid, but it turns out grades are not worth much in applying for grad school or getting a job. 

I have no friends and am developmentally behind in communicating with my peers, I developed a terrible stutter, and I don‚Äôt know how to socialize anymore. Recently I tried to put myself out there and talk to ppl, but they try to get rid of me as a friend as soon as possible. I have no friends now. Of course I have no romantic experience and no hope in ever getting into any romantic relationship because of my two problems above. I have been on dating apps for around three months, and nobody that I like is interested in me, and my standards are very low. Throughout my life I must have been rejected by 300+ girls online and around 10 in person, I was never ‚Äòaccepted‚Äô (whatever the opposite of rejection is) by any. I consider myself pretty chill and I‚Äôm not some misogynistic lunatic or sex crazed deviant. And this is despite maxing everything I can in my personal life. Lastly, by reading so much philosophy I developed a value change, and I cannot connect to people because of it.

TLDR So I guess my question is when is it logical to call it quits. I have no career, romantic, or community prospects. Compared to 4 yrs ago I improved everything that was in my control, but I did not improve in any of the three fields I mentioned. Instead, now I have other problems I wasn‚Äôt struggling with before, namely being developmentally behind and having different values. ",1
"After deleting the last two posts I deleted on this subreddit maybe this one is gonna stay a bit longer. 
I'm 19 years old and I wanted to kill myself for about six years but never got closer to actually doing it than making a knot in a rope to hang myself or ""almost"" jumping of bridges as I don't have access to guns (if I had I'm very certain I would be dead already). 

Over the years I often kinda hurt myself (like slapping myself, carving my skin with sticks a little, putting my hands against hot stuff till I couldn't take it anymore) but never really viewed it as actual ""to be taken serious"" self harm because I didn't want to admit to myself that I need help. 
Last night I however took some scissors and cut my left arm in several locations and put lemon juice on the wounds so it would hurt more so I'd be able to ""escape"" my feelings. 
Long story short today I got up and took a shower and then noticed that there's visible cuts on my arm from last night (could've figured that was gonna happen earlier but I'm just a mess lately and it's affecting my thinking) and I realised I'll have to hide that wound because I don't know how I'd explain it. 

I also realised that I can no longer act like I have normal issues everybody has and I feel so guilty because I should be the stable factor for my girlfriend (she has bpd) but instead I'm a mess and on the verge of breaking up with her because I'm just on an overload of emotions even though I don't even have any excuse for being so depressed, as far as I know I don't even have any trauma??

Anyway I thought about getting help and talking to a therapist but I'm so scared to do that because therapists are also just people and I hate talking about my issues to other people, especially because I don't even understand what's wrong with myself. 

Is there any advice you have for me? ",1
"I had a pretty nice and comfortable childhood. And even then I knew that my adulthood would be godawful. Lo and behold I was completely right. Almost every adult with anything to say would tell me adulthood is constant stress from five thousand directions. If anything they were sugarcoating it.

If only I had killed myself before adulthood started I would've avoided so much headache. The only redeemable thing about it has been the occasional sex and drugs. Other than that, adulthood is nothing but making and spending money and being stressed out. Now I am in deeper than ever before, and even more damage will be done if I ever choose to end all that noise. Maybe the worst part of it is that the one real choice I have that's mine, the choice to kill myself, can't even be carried out with dignity or peace. 

Hopefully I'll either find the courage to end the cycle, or get killed randomly.

I have 7 sisters, (4 older, 3 younger) and 3 older brothers. My house is pretty fucked up to be honest. I got my phone smashed because I didn't make my younger sister food even though my mom told her to make it. My mom hasn't bought me a new phone yet, (its been 6 months). My mom also has walked in on me when I'm showering, I know she's my mom and all, but it just makes me uncomfortable to be honest. I remember one time in year/grade 6 (when I was about 11/10 years old), I felt really shitty and I just wanted to end myself, all my friends left me and made rumours about me and I remember I told one of my sisters about it, she told me I was overreacting. Then I hid the note behind the couch I completely forgot about it. My mom found it a few days later, she began screaming at me, she was pissed. I just cried in my room. I've never felt so shitty. I've been losing my friends, being disruptive and getting high. I've had thoughts about killing my mom and family members whenever I felt shitty. I've had thoughts of stabbing myself over and over again. I just want to end it all. I've been self-harm free for 2 months. I really want to finish myself off, I just want to actually fucking die. Please don't say that I have potential or that I shouldn't, I just want to die. I really want to die, I've tried overdosing, hanging etc. I want to be sent away to a mental hospital, please.

"I have a huge credit card debt that I am unable to pay. The collectors are all bugging me profoundly. I am overwhelmed and drained. But I have no other means. This has been going on for months and I was doing my best to cope. Thoughts of ending my life to escape it have visited my mind occassionally but I set it aside and continue to live.

While I was struggling, I found out last week that I am being evicted in my permanent residence since I haven't fully paid the lot. What is more painful though is that neighbors and local officials produced documents containing fallacious information about me so they can have the lot.

It is awful. I was starting to relapse. Thinking more about death but I decided I'll try to fight today. But upon waking up, I received news that one of the collectors called our HR Department! I feel so ashamed! Now, I keep thinking of death many times. I couldn't handle the pressure, the anxiety! One problem after the other!

What is painful is this.. I am sure no one will understand. People will assume that I am in huge debt and broke because I am some irresponsible spendthrift. But they don't know that...

I am in huge debt because the main contributing factor was my shopping/hoarding/collecting addiction from 2021-2023...

I got shopping addiction because my depression and anxiety intensified...

My depression and anxiety intensified because of acquired bipolar disorder...

I acquired bipolar disorder because my husband abused me emotionally and financially for 19 years and he abandoned me last 2020...

Now he is living like a rich bachelor kid because he is an only son and heir while I live in misery. I couldn't file a case against him because I couldn't afford it financially and mentally. (We have no divorce and annulment, the only option, is very expensive and a brutal fight).

I am extremely frustrated and I feel hopeless. Plus when I explain to people I have BD and/or I am depressed, they just brush it off like I am just sad or I have fever. They also do not realized how my husband fucked up my life, my family, my dreams. How he took away my health, my beauty, my youth.

Now I messed up my life and no one sees the root but just me, a shameful, irresponsible me. I am a piece of shit and I hope to die soon.",1

"what the title says. i don't have the energy to type this in an organized way, sorry. i'm 21nb in the US trying to finish college. i'm also autistic (diagnosed) and i've never been able to hold a job for longer than 3 months or so due to my disability. college is indescribably hard for me at this point, and why am i even getting a degree i won't be able to use. i have severe PTSD from being raped/abused for nearly a year when i was underage and it still affects me every day. i assume i have pretty bad substance abuse issues because i can't go a day without drinking or smoking to cope with this shit life. i just realized i was craving a beer while writing this and then saw it's only 10am on a tuesday which made me feel like such a fucking failure. i'm only close with one side of my family and they're all either already dead, or dying of medical conditions. we are poor, can't afford a house, barely affording medical care even with lots of medicaid coverage. i have enough savings to stay at my apartment for a little while longer, but when they run out i truly have no idea what i'm going to do (can't work and don't qualify for SSI). the income needed to live sustainably in my area is over $30/hr--i have never made that much money in my life nor am i set up on a trajectory to do so. i've already been homeless when i was 18 and i'd rather kill myself than do that again. i have a partner whom i love very much but they are in the same boat as me in many of these aspects, sometimes it feels like we just exacerbate each others' problems. 

most of my day to day life involves skipping class to drink at the public park or go read at a bar. reading books is probably the only thing i do regularly that brings me any joy. i don't know how much longer i can hang on like this, especially considering things are going to get much worse in the near future. growing up i was always a star kid, good grades, plenty of ""future prospects,"" super friendly, etc. now i'm essentially just an unhealthy hermit who wants to die. 

i don't understand people who praise my country for being an amazing place to live in. i tried to do everything ""right""--save money, graduate high school, attend college (i even got a full ride but lost it last year), maintain a good network of family and friends. knowing that i already tried my best and my future prospects include being homeless and not being able to afford to eat is not doing wonders for my already fucked head",1

it says to consider the death penalty for child sexual abusers. that's one thing. but when you consider that trans people are porn for existing and thus any child seeing a trans person would be ""exposed to porn""... yeah. 

the rest is a whole other can of worms that make me want to kms slightly less

i don't think most of you guys can understand what it's like to be despised and to have people want you dead and burning in hell and people praying for your downfall and to have the government take away your rights and lock you up/kill you. just for existing and helping yourself. for being different. be afraid walking alone. you shouldn't have to and i don't want you to. nobody should have to understand that.

i'm mentally ill with diagnosed depression, ptsd, agoraphobia, insomnia, and am on a cocktail of 5 meds that i can't live without. straight up can't sleep without one of them. last year i had to up my dosage on one 

i've considered moving to australia/nz but i'd be uprooting my whole life. i'd be so far away from my family and friends and time zones would mess up communication. then there's the visa process; i can't even go there without a visa. then what the hell am i gonna do about my medications? i can maybe go a day or two without most of them but i need my insomnia one daily

then what about study? i'm taking community college atm with plans to transfer to my state's most well known university and am admitted to it though not taking classes

the reason i am considering moving to australia/nz is work. there are some great resources for my interests connected to my major. i don't think canada offers that

in the past i have been able to talk myself out of it including guilting myself out of it. i've set goals to at least wait until whatever series i'm interested in ends but things are so bad i'm probably gonna end up ruling it out. i've been able to do that for around 10 years at this point but things are getting that bad

i've partially written a note but not a main one. been thinking of writing a full one just to get it out even if i don't do anything

i'm not really a direct danger to myself right now even if i am thinking of these things but i don't know how long that will last. whenever i think of doing my preferred method i always see myself telling someone and going to the hospital before anything super bad happens to me.

if i move elsewhere i guess i'd technically be considered a refugee but that feels so wrong to say as a privileged american

i dunno how long i can keep this up, man.",1
"I'm a 20 year old male. I think about killing myself everyday. I dont feel like a person just a shell of one. I feel as if I am not a human. When I go to work the thoughts don't stop. When I do anything the thoughts don't stop. I just wantcto be happy but haven't for as long as I can remember. I have no family, not a single friend and my fiance left me because I'm a miserable person. I have nothing I don't even have money. Everyday it's the same thing. Go to work thinking about killing myself and then go home then contuine thinking about killing myself.

I battle with anxiety which is a whole other story itself. The things I feel are terrible everyday. It keeps getting worse. I told myself I would end it at 30 years old if it didn't get better but I'm considering even sooner now. I'm am extremely negative, miserable, depressed person. I wishcit would go away.

"I simply cannot find a way to (financially) get out of this monthly loop of just having enough to pay rent, taxes etc. In fact I would love to no longer work for someone who doesn't even know who I am ever again. I don't mind working though, I would in fact love to ""work"" physically, hiking up the Alps, biking across an entire country, kayaking through beautiful rivers. I would love work with my hands in my own garden, secluded by the pollutions of modern cities and put in hard work on fixing or adjusting whatever may be needed on my very own house, in a beautiful countryside. All these things however - travelling, fully owning a house in a beautiful area - cost a lot of money. With my lack of talents and understanding of moneymaking I simply cannot see a way to achieve financial independence to experience (live) these things and as such I cannot ever see myself living the (rather simple) life I would love to live, with its occasional travels and the cozy house surrounded by nature. To me, I just see no point in living when I can't even find the path towards that goal. I can't get out of the system so to speak.

  
Edit: I realize the usage of the word 'poverty' may not have been ideal, I have a bed, a roof over my head (for now) and while I can't afford most meat anymore, I can still eat food everyday unlike many (far too many) in the world right now. I'm not sure what other word to have used, as when comparing myself to those financially independent it does feel like poverty though.",1

"I'm 24M. Just waiting to pay my car off so I can put a permanent end to this loneliness. The loan is under my dad's name and I really don't want to put him into even deeper debt before I leave this world. I have about 4 years until my car is paid off. It feels surreal and exciting at the same time knowing that all of this will come to an end in just 4 years. I am genuinely excited and happy that I will be dead while I‚Äôm still young. 

All I ever saw romantically was ridicule and rejection throughout my short life, even after consistent dieting, exercising, lifting weights at the gym, and genuine attempts to make myself feel better and to socialize with others. I have just accepted the fact that I am too ugly to date anyone and I am never going to find a romantic partner. I was never meant for romantic connection. It genuinely makes me feel like I am less than human for not having any experience in this aspect, despite already being 24 years old. Therapy and meds don‚Äôt help me in the slightest bit. Looking back at it, they were both a complete waste of time. I finished an entire prescription of anti-anxiety medicine and it did absolutely nothing to better my mental state. Medication is useless.

I will die before I turn 30. I'd rather not live past this age and end up living to my 60s or 70s without ever finding a romantic partner. I know exactly who I am and I am absolutely certain that my life will stay this way if I don't die while I'm still in my 20s. I am a strong believer in fatalism and I am certain that there is no future for me where I am happy and fulfilled, no matter how much time or effort I put into myself. 

I have a few close friends in my life, but it will be very easy for them to find a replacement. I am very easy to replace as a person. There are many others like me in the world, and I am absolutely sure that everyone in my life will quickly get over my passing.

I am very serious about this and I plan on withdrawing out of my retirement funds to purchase a shotgun.

Been feeling this way since 14 years old with absolutely no end in sight. I have simply accepted that this will be my fate until I kill myself once my car is paid off. ",1

"Was SA‚Äôd as a kid. Years later, it came back to me and the self loathing began. Diagnosed with ADHD, depression, etc. I sought help. For years I have held on for my family. Therapy. Exercise. Eating better. I moved abroad. I don‚Äôt think I deserve to be alive. 

I‚Äôve never told anyone about my assault. I never would. I don‚Äôt get anything out of it and they‚Äôd just be burdened with useless information. 

I stayed because I didn‚Äôt want people to think school or finding a job made me suicidal. I submitted my thesis and I‚Äôm graduating. I got some job offers. So can I please go now? My work is done here. 

I thought people wanted to help. They didn‚Äôt. They just wanted to feel better about themselves. Some close friends even ghosted me after I mentioned being suicidal. Some don‚Äôt believe it. ‚ÄúHow can you be depressed but still go to the gym? Or find a job? You‚Äôre okay man, don‚Äôt be so negative!‚Äù. ‚ÄúYou gotta ask Ok_Currency_2464, they‚Äôre the drug addict here.‚Äù It used to bother me. Now I just avoid people altogether. 

I‚Äôm a hypocrite myself. I‚Äôm afraid of trying new medications because of how I see myself already. A drug addicted helpless idiot who has everybody convinced they‚Äôre smart. And I‚Äôm okay with others being queer, but I really hate that I myself could be asexual. I feel bad if I show the slightest hint that I‚Äôm not ok. If I tell my sister she‚Äôd pray for me. My father didn‚Äôt get my hints, thought I was joking. My mom, well, she‚Äôs literally the sweetest person I have known. I can‚Äôt let her know how I feel. 

So I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm canceling my appointments. My meetings. I‚Äôve deleted messaging apps from my phone. I don‚Äôt deserve to be here, and the world is too cruel to deserve me either. My self loathing finally overcame my love for others. 


I can‚Äôt swim. And the knife is sharp enough to help me go. I‚Äôve surveyed the bodies of water closest to me. I hope I‚Äôm brave enough to make it. And maybe someday you‚Äôll find this.

44m

I relocated to Memphis TN last year for work from Nee Orleans LA. As soon as I set foot in this place, I kinda knew it wasn't for me - was not happy, but the work was good and I decided it would have to grow on me. I had came up BRIEFLY for a few weeks over the summer to get the transition lined up and made the permanent relocation in October.

So while I was on my temp summer jaunt, I went out for my birthday by myself to this little beer and pizza joint. There was this server who was absolutely beautiful - she wasn't MY server, but she kept making excuses to come by my table to talk. She was enchanting. She awkwardly spilled a bit of water on me and we laughed. After I left I thought little of it.

So then I move to the area permanently, find a local dive bar... and she is there. Still beautiful. She approaches me, we reconnect. Long story short, we very quickly fall in love.

She is my life. Everything she does is musical and magical. She doesn't even drink (always DD for her drunk sister, thus why at the bar) and tells me she decided to quit when she realized she didn't handle alcohol well. I respect it and tell her I'm haply to quit myself, or at least never do it around her - all she needs do is tell me, she's totally worth it. She tells me not to worry about it.

She moves in with me. I could not be happier.

We go out for dinner one night, she tells me she thinks she's in a good place to casually drink again. I tell her only she can make that decision, just make sure she feels right about it. Now here it gets a little weird, because I remember thinking ""this could be the start of bad things"" but I tried to push it out of my head.

Her drinking doesn't seem troublesome - for a while at least.

She winds up getting a job bartenders at the same dive we met in. She's excited and I support it, since the money is good, she wants to do it, and the location is super convenient. Another time when I wish I would have realized then that this was setting up for a massive failure later....

Slowly, her focus becomes more on staying out all night drinking than on anything else. I still do not suspect infidelity at all, as she would be extremely open about her activities, just staying out all night getting incredibly drunk and stumbling in 4-6am most nights. I work a high stress day job, but I tried to adjust the best I could.

Now she had always made no secret that she wanted to marry. And we had talked about it in detail and I wanted it as much if not more than her. She knew a proposal was coming soon and appeared to be thrilled about it.

So I booked the hotel for a week in New Orleans over July 4th, told her we would take a week so I could bring her to my hometown and show her where I come from (she had never been). I planned on proposing in front of St Louis Cathedral during the July 4th fireworks over the river. My plan was BARELY a secret. She essentially knew I was proposing. Again she was on cloud 9.

The Friday before we are scheduled to leave, she wants to go to Beale st to go out with me. I am somewhat reluctant (more concerned with the upcoming trip in 4 days) but I decide to take her out per request anyhow.

Then night falls apart.

She gets black out drunk. She mouths off to some Memphis police and almost gets us arrested. I tell her we have to go home because the cops are seriously considering taking us in because of her behavior. She unleashes hell on me. Calls me worthless. A failure. A piece of shit. She tries to get the streetcar co doctor not to let me on the car.... screams vulgarity at me in front of the other riders. She almost falls off the car when it stops and myself and a bystander catch her so she doesn't hurt herself. ""Get your fuckin hands off me"".

I tell her ""I can't fuckin do this. I can't marry this"".

She tries to swing on me several times in the middle of the street. 

I call her coworkers/bar buddies and tell them to come pick her up and I wait around the corner to ensure she's safe, then take an uber home.

They take her back to the bar and keep feeding her liquor. She comes in at sunup unintelligible drunk and passes out.

We try to talk that morning, she doesn't remember anything, but tells me I'm a monster for leaving her ""alone"" (I was still there till she left) downtown drunk and defenseless. I ask her where do we go from here - that this is her one chance to tell me what she wants, and I'll do it.

She chooses to avoid accountability and just berate me.

I go to New Orleans alone for the week.

It's horrible. I just sit on the river, stare at the barges and the bridge, and quietly drink by myself.

I return 2 weeks later, she's still at the house. I try to talk to her one more time, she avoids talking/accountability completely. I finally tell her we are over. She goes to work/late night drinking/whatever and STILL keeps coming to the house when she needs to. I finally tell her to not come back unless it's to get her personal belongings. 

....they're still here.

I return to work today after 2 weeks (my work knew about the proposal plans AND the complete failure that followed). I have to face all these people looking at me like I'm a broken wretch that is just waiting for the right moment to swan dive off the fuckin bridge.

It's awkward and humiliating.

I get to our job site. Discover that several of my coworkers actively despise me (by their own words). 

I am now stuck in this town that I never wanted to be in, lovelier than I have ever felt in my life, surrounded by shit that reminds me of her, just waiting till this lease expires and I can move back home to New Orleans.

I literally have no one here now. It is the coldest feeling I have ever experienced in my life. The only thing that keeps me holding on is that I know I'll be back home for Mardi Gras.

Sorry, that was long.",1

And the one girl who did like me, i went and message one of the girls who used me. I remember she would smile not to make me comfortable, or to show she was having fun or to influence me in anyway, but because she was genuinely happy to be with me. And i went behind her back and she got with her ex gf 2 months later. She‚Äôs pretty, smart, althetic and nice to people and has alot of friends and seems to be able to talk to anyone, i can see why she likes her shes the complete opposite of me.

My father was similar, but the physical abuse was worse, when I was 8 I left a lego piece on my floor, he stomped on it, got hurt and then went to beat me with a belt multiple times, when I was 13 he went completely absent from my life, see him once three months and everytime I see him he only speaks about how his life is miserable and that I don't care about him, and how I'm ""exactly"" like him and I'm destined to have the same shit life as he does.

I am trying to excuse my shitty behaviour, but it wouldn't be a lie if I didn't admited it is somewhat linked with my terrible upbringing, I am now a 18 year old, not ready for adult life at all and ready to die, not mainly because I'm depressed, but because if I keep on living I'm sentencing myself to a horrible life.",1

No one loves me. The person who I thought did just wants me to stick around to fufill their own needs and attention while they find something better. I know that this is the truth deep down but I try to ignore it everyday. I'm a dirty little secret. 

I hate myself, I hate everything about myself. I have no future. Everytime I've tried to change something happens to knock me back down and it gets harder and harder to get back up and keep trying. Why should I put effort into changing when I hate myself this much? 

My family constantly criticise everything I do, nothing is good enough, there is always more I should have done.

Where do I begin, I spent all of my childhood dealing with trauma (now live with my dad who saved me from the abuse), have 2 failed relationships, dropped out of 2 colleges because I'm autistic and struggle with everything, being so hideous I cry alot wishing I was better looking, I eat unhealthy, lost 4 people last year 2 family members to cancer and 2 to suicide and only found out a few weeks ago 2 more of my family members have cancer, I have a diploma in computing but due to trauma I've been left with extremely shaky hands making working on computing impossible it makes me feel like a fraud. I already have attempted once with an overdose but everyday I struggle to do anything I feel like a failure to my family I almost feel like a leech knowing I'll never be able to give back everything they've given me 

Here in the UK due to a lack of funding I'm not able to get any real treatment, the last suicide hotline I vented to said to me ""what do you want me to do about it"" and when I almost made another attempt I was told ""unless you're actively bleeding, stop calling us"" or ""drink camomile tea and go for a walk"" 

Truthfully I hadn't planned on living this long and just nothing feels like it's gonna change I can't be happy about anything as once I do something always goes wrong like I mentioned with my other family with cancer

I truthfully just don't know where to turn from here just when I think I've hit rock bottom it goes even further.",1
"I tried to kill myself earlier this year, but I got too drunk and passed out before I cut deep enough. 

I'm a 25 year old woman, I have a girlfriend we're planning to get married, lots of friends and a supportive family. But I am miserable. Not because of anyone else. I just hate myself. I hate my brain. 

In 2022 things were generally going well for me. I was making and playing music consistently, I had two decent jobs and I was going out multiple times a week. I was raped at the end of that year and ever since I just haven't been able to pick up the pieces. 

I've been unemployed for the majority of the time since, I only sleep about 1 out 2 days at best, when I'm awake the only thing I can do is distract myself with video games or youtube, and I'm too fucking lazy to pull myself up even a little bit And find a job, keep myself consistently medicated or even email a therapist.

My girlfriend would never say this but I can tell she's had enough, and the same goes for most of my friends. But I've tried everything I can think of and I just can't stick to it. 80% of every single day for the last year and a half the only thought going through my brain is suicide. How I'll do it. When I'll do it. The exact logistics of it. Writing out every bullet point I want to hit in my note. Every. Single. Day. Even when I try to force myself to stop, my brain screams KILL YOURSELF louder and powder in my ear. 

Every single day I wake up angry at myself, besides gray ass depression the only thing that enters my mind is rage and anger towards myself. 

So idk I guess I'm just venting. I have no reason to kill myself, I there's such simple steps that would make my life better. But I just won't do them apparently. So I'm done. I'm checking out. Idk when but soon.",1
"Ive suffered with depression since a very young age (9yrs old) at the age of 29 I finally came out as transgender. Thinking this would be the answer to my depression, It wasn't. I was able to cure some dysphoria but im still miserable I have deep rooted issues of abandonment and co-dependancy, my parents have told me they can't help me anymore with anything. As if I've been a burden on them for too long but it feels directly linked to the fact I came out as trans and they aren't supportive of that. My ex broke up with me because I transitioned and I came to terms with it but I'm heartbroken, Ive gone on dates to try recover a slice of feelgood but I feel nothing. I have zero friends to talk to. I now struggle to get interviews for jobs, something that never was a problem before transition. Ive given up all vices, I don't drink alcohol or use drugs and yet here I am completely sober on a high dose of anti depressants and I still can't function properly. I don't know what else I can change or do to  actually feel better. It's now at a point where I'm hyper fixating on ending my life and that scares the sh*t outta me! ",1

"I am only 15 years old, I do so much fucked up stuff on the internet I hardly can recognize myself with the person I once was. No gods are answering me. I feel useless and empty. I have gone through three suicidal episodes in the span of two months. The things I did didnt hurt anybody, I cant get into specifics but I relieved myself to a video of SA. I have so much of that shit on my phone including üçï. And with me being so young I thought it was justifiable. Now, I feel like a horrible human being and every day I have these overbearing thoughts to just leave this planet because I cant bare facing who I might turn out to be in my life. I seek help and guidance, I am too young for this.",1

I don‚Äôt fantasize about a big funeral or anything - I doubt anyone would show up and that‚Äôs okay with me. I plan to donate my money and belongings to charity. 

Sorry, I am too stupid to elaborate on this. I mean that I genuinely lack the cognitive ability. But I compare it to the same feelings as when I was actually raped, now just never ending. 

I know I make no sense. I am not smart enough to really have the language to describe what specifically has encouraged me to make this plan. ",1
"Howdy i have seen many of these other post so I decided to share my story: I am a 12 year old who has been through many things so many to the fact that I can't describe i also have my mental illnesses such as adhd and autism and many other things but I dont see a reason to live i dont see why looking forward to another day i dont see why try too make more friends all I do Is make a fool of myself all I do is annoy everyone around me all I do is ruin everything all I do is sit around wasting air and food and money and I just don't know what do do anymore 



But It was nice sharing this with whoever views this I hope everyone knows that no matter what there is light in the dark you just have to try your hardest to get to it. ",1
"I don't have the same experience as a lot of people I see on here. Nothing very bad has happened to me since I was a teenager, and I'm 26 now. I'm married, I'm at the end of a 5 year apprenticeship, my parents have sought therapy and apologized, my siblings and I all love each other, and my friends care for me so much. I have two cats who I would give anything for. My wife is beautiful and kind and loving and deserves so much more than me, and than this. I have a great therapist and I'm on medications that usually work. I have great health insurance and a pension for retirement. 

Despite it all, every day I think about dying. It's like when things were rough, I broke something within myself and now I think about suicide every day. I think about how not existing would be worth the pain, and how no matter what I do to repair my life, I can't fix how broken I am deep inside. 

Last year I went to the mental hospital. I spent a week inpatient. Something new broke in me there, when I watched my wife cry and panic every day trying to figure out what to do. When I heard my dad and mom calmly and carefully encouraging me to get better over the phone. Not only have I become broken beyond repair, but I've broken them too through this process. I have done irreparable damage that I can never take back. 

I don't want to break anybody or anything again. I can't live with the guilt and constant hollow aching anymore. 

Any advice would be appreciated ",1
Feel like nothing makes me happy. Can't remember when I last had a good day. I feel numb to others feelings. I don't want to keep going on. Feel like the world hates me and sometimes I hate it too. I'm tired of struggling everyday. I've been out of prison 2 months and the world went and left me behind. Over 7 years in and then they put me in a state I have never lived. I have no ties here. My kids don't really talk to me. My other family doesn't really talk to me. I'm lost in the outside world. Everyday feels like pain. It so hard to carry on. I don't even want to try. I've started planning how to do it. I hate myself. I really really don't k ow why I even carry on from one day to the next. This world doesn't make since to me. People don't make since to me.

"On year 3.5 of unstable employment. I hate freelancing for scraps. Every final round for a job i interview for, i get told how much of a great candidate i am and that im impressive, but theyre moving forward with someone else or internal hire, and every application grows a little more demoralizing. I no longer foresee a future for myself. The lie that working hard will land you a comfortable life was forced down my throat my entire life and down the throat of my parents. My items are damaged from a flood. Im in debt bc i have to survive off of credit cards, and i cant afford to pay anything any more. My debt will be going to collections soon. I cant afford to support my family, i am angry at my mother for shaming me for so long about not finding stable employment just for her to land herself in the same situation, her barely applying for shit after harassing me for fucking years, and i feel shame that i cant help her out. I cant even do survival sex work as it makes my partner highly uncomfortable, but i feel its the one skill i could use to make literally anything.

"If therapy works for you, this post isn't for you. Don't try and change my mind over it.

I can't stand therapy, I've been in it for years and years. I trusted the process, the whole ""just find a therapist that works for you"" thing. So I went from therapist to therapist. None of them were help. I didn't feel better at all. 
The only thing that helped was medication. And I'm off that shit now so I'm screwed.

I actually felt worse anytime they'd just try and tell me ""it gets better"". Show me then. Show me how to make it better. Just being told that all the god damn time isn't helping, it just makes me angry. 

They expect you to trust them to tell them anything. But when you tell them you want to die or take your own life, or hurt yourself, they freak out. 

Just over therapy. I'm never doing it again I've just given up.",1

"So lemme tell you something, I am fucked up from so many things already, I don't have friends, I don't have really anything. Then my mom, she fucks it up worse she makes everything about herself giving me the dumbest arguments known to mankind, I am tired and I can't do anything about it, if I tell someone about my feelings of being suicidal they will either mock me or just make it worse like my parents, if I tell em that am suicidal they will tell me how they raised me and am sure they will go
""Ohhhhhh, well ya know I knew it, so now you are basically just sayin that I made u suicidal"" 
Then they will either yell at me till I lose ma mind or start crying or shit. I try me best everyday no matter what I just work and do what am supposed to but even then my mother fucks up my schedules and all. And I wish I could end myself but that is not possible, I can't go to therapy because my parents would say am exaggerating it, I can't. I don't have no Motherfuckin person to fuckin tell some fuckin shit about my weird mf life. When I argue she doesn't fucking understand anything I cannot move out because I am 15, and I would starve if i ran away. No one exists to understand me and no don't worry about it because I don't know, maybe am dead by the time u read. I can't taketshit anymore continuously telling myself that I am good and that things will go my way because I try and I fucking keep on trying but out brains know there is a limit and once reached we ain't doing shit. I can't bear listening to someone say ""ToMOrroWI iS a neW DaY"" Cause fuck no jake, it ain't a new day it's just earth cycling back in a certain way that reduces the amount of light reaching the part I live in to 0 before the cycle repeats and we are facing sun again. Nothing changes. And nor do I wanna hear try reaching out, like no shit sherlock I tried. And yeah whilst they say it ain't the solution yes, sometimes suicide is indeed the solution.

"Hi there, I am not a native speaker so, yes, I really want to write down my story.

I am 26 and last year i divorced my marriage, we where together since I am 17.. so you see a long time. Nothing bad happend, we didn't cheat or something else. I'll guess it's my fault wasting his time. 

I grew up in a village from a good parent household. My parents know his parents and they always said, ohhh our children should be a couple, dream couple ... and and and... for some real we got pushed in this role, but I don't want to play a victim, it was my own decision (I guess) 

I was never really happy in this relationship, he knows, my parents knows, we had nothing similar. I am more that type of human ""spread love and help everyone"" and he was more like ""other humans problems are not my business"" (he's banker, you're problem is only his business when you need money) &lt; his favorite joke 

Ok - so in this RS, Marriage from 2014 to 2023 we seen a lot, we buyed a lot, 2 houses, moved 900 KM away from our home and much more. 

It's like I was sleeping and last year I woke up from a dream and don't want to life this live anymore, it's like a bubble popped and I tried so hard to suppress this unhappiness but... i couldn't. I divorced and he was ok. We don't have a fight or trouble, we are friends now. We don't had children together, just cat &amp; dog. (Our future goal was always, be richer then to others üòì)

Since then I am single and I don't sleep with someone else, because I feel like wtf how should this work with someone else? And I am a wife or I was a wife, I am too good for this hook up culture! 

.... Now I am here, feel completely lost, I don't want my old life back, but I feel like, I can't see the why for living. Why I am here, what todo. Anxiety haunt me everyday. 

From the outside I am strong / independent women. But in the inside I am a children. 

And I don't do drugs, no medicine, alcohol, no smoking... I eat healthy and still feel so depressed. üòî 

I feel like I don't know who I am.. where I am be and and and. All my friends have BC 30+
Wtf I was all this time married and had no time for this, when they where drunk at party's I was at work, nursed my dad and cooked for my husband! (No we are not a religious cult or something like this, we are not religious) 

I really feel lost, I feel like shit but my old life was not good at all too. My old life was a golden cage.

I don't know, I really feel like everyone around me is in a dream bubble and I am the only one who is awake ü•≤

And I feel so much guilt and shame, how much time I waste in his life. I mean yes I was always honestly about my unhappiness, but I was never brave enough to go. 

I literally destroyed 2 lives, mine and his. I wish I could suppress my emotions and feelings and life with him until we are old. But over the years it got everything so worse, that I didn't wanted that he touch me anymore. But I was always loyal! I never cheated. 

Omg my head feel so sick ü§¢

"I was scrolling through this sub a few months ago and tried to take my life and failed.

I woke up one day and started looking for jobs and would tell myself ‚Äúif I don‚Äôt find one I can just kill myself‚Äù then I went to a mental health professional to get meds for suicidal thoughts, I told myself ‚Äúif these meds don‚Äôt work I‚Äôll kill myself‚Äù they worked to subside my suicidal thoughts about 75%.

i used to feel like i was someone worth talking to, someone people were excited to see, someone whose perspectives people valued. it really fucking hurts to think that to everyone in my life i‚Äôm just really fucking unnoticeable and nothing noteworthy. i never thought i was particularly special but i at least thought i had people who enjoyed my company or spirit. i feel really fucking stupid for thinking that now

"i‚Äôve relapsed with self-harm after 1 year and 7 months clean. i relapsed with alcohol. summer has never been a good time for me mentally, but this year it‚Äôs really bad. context: in april my cousin was hate-crimed and found murdered 5 days after going missing. 2.5 weeks later, my now-ex gf broke up w me, completely out of the blue, abandoning me. 

i‚Äôm in so much pain all the time. i‚Äôve already had a traumatic life before all this, i‚Äôve lost a lot of people in my life. in april of 2022, my mom died as a result of domestic violence. i was abused horribly as a child, raped at 17, and have been sexually assaulted many times. i suffer from BPD (along with other disorders) and it‚Äôs made my life hell. 

i‚Äôve been addicted to self-harm heavily since 2018 (though i started in 2014). i thought i‚Äôd overcome this demon. i thought maybe i could make it out to the other side. but now, im right back in that hole that i worked so hard to get out of. 

i don‚Äôt see a point anymore. every time i get better, every time i feel happy, i get knocked on my ass again. i can‚Äôt handle this grief anymore, i can‚Äôt handle anymore trauma. i just want the pain to stop. i want to be normal and happy, but i guess that‚Äôs just not in the cards for me‚Ä¶",1
I dont want to go to details but it becames worse and worse all the time. I can't escape loneliness and that is what causes it. Often I feel like I am the only person alive and all the others don't exist or they are some sort of npcs. I don't have any connection to other people any more.,1

"This is dumb and stupid but I don‚Äôt care. I am so tired and i need to vent

I (16m) have had a shitty life. I know others had it worse. I know i am probably so lucky. I know i should suck it up and deal with it and actually get a life but im sick of this. Im sick.  
My whole life was basically spent on the internet. It raised me. It ruined and saved me. I wish my parents broke my electronics when i was younger and never looked back. Or maybe i just wish they were better parents. I wish they actually loved me.

they might say they do, but they don‚Äôt. My mom is controlling, strict, annoying and so, so mean to me. She fills me up with sweet nothings then she breaks me down to my core. My dad is basically not there. He‚Äôs present but not really. He‚Äôs distant emotionally and im terrified of him. He used to beat me and my siblings and he says he feels bad, he regrets it but he doesn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt forgive him. If he truly felt bad he would make up for it but he doesn‚Äôt. He works all day long and is so tired all the time and i just don‚Äôt know. I will never forget that day where he yelled at me and my brother, basically threatened to kill him because he was trans, ‚Äúif the government doesn‚Äôt kill you, i will‚Äù he said. He threw things and made me, my brother and my mother cry. He put his hand in my brothers private part and told him he had female genitalia so he was female. He said ‚Äúand don‚Äôt you dare say you have trauma because of that.‚Äù I hugged my mom and told her that i was so sorry. She should be sorry. She did nothing to stop him. She is his accomplice. If they found out anything about me, that im trans or bi, they would ruin our lives. They have done it before. That I‚Äôm autistic, ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt have autism because you‚Äôre smart and autism is a disability and you dont have a disability. You can‚Äôt be autistic because you can function.‚Äù Was basically what my mom told me. I live on eggshells because they are around.

i have struggled mentally for basically my entire life. I have so many toxic tendencies, I struggle to stay alive every single day. I don‚Äôt know how much longer i can do this. But my siblings, i can‚Äôt leave them but i want to.  
i have no future. I‚Äôm lazy i really am, i like to draw but i can never seem to be able to open up the drawing App. I like to write but i can‚Äôt seem to actually bother. I want to start commissions but nothing is working, i‚Äôm so useless and worthless. Everything i‚Äôve ever touched gets ruined. I‚Äôm a bad omen.

so i left all my friends, and my partner. Like i said, my whole life was spent on the internet. So obviously, i have had many online friends over the years. I met my best friend on the internet. All my relationships were on the internet. Almost everything that mattered was and is on the internet. when i was 14, i met this boy, and fell in love. I was ruined, and he broke me. Almost a year of my life was wasted on him. Then when i left him, he called me the n-slur (classy) then said it was because he was having a bad day afterwards. When i blocked him, he sent his friend to talk to me, tell me he was suffering and that he attempted and was acting shitty in school just so i can pity him and go back to him. But I didn‚Äôt. I know it was just some dumb teenage relationship but i was genuinely never the same afterwards. I still sent him one last message giving him advice and his friend said he got better. I blocked him a while after, too. I‚Äòm glad i helped when nobody helped me. Well, they tried. I guess i really am selfish and stubborn, what ugly personality traits. Afterwards, i met them. I wish i could say when i did, it was perfect and i was happy. But i wasn‚Äôt. I self-harmed again, for the first time after dating that boy. I had my first panic attacks. I so desperately didn‚Äôt want to experience what i did with that boy, i guess. I confessed and we started dating. I loved them truly, i still do. I still love them. But i was rarely truly happy. Maybe if i was more open, but I refused to open up. I lied and lied and lied. I never felt so fake in my life. I self-harmed the most in that period. One hour i‚Äôll be feeling an all-time high with them, the other they say one thing that upsets me and i fully shut down. I‚Äôve never cried this much except with that boy. I would ignore them for hours, days, because i could not text them after being upset and I couldn‚Äôt open up. I know its my fault and i fucked im and i feel bad. Sometimes being with them felt like my heart was genuinely burning in my chest, not in the good way. I truly don‚Äôt know how to explain how it feels. I almost attempted suicide. I‚Äôll never forget the true happiness i felt when I convinced myself i‚Äôd go through with it. a relief that cannot be explained. I‚Äôll never forget my 16th birthday. It was such, such a good day. But then it progressively got worse. I sent my ex partner a drawing my brother drew for me. ‚ÄúHe looks like he lives in his mothers basement.‚Äù It was meant as a joke, i know. But it hurt. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs so mean!‚Äù ‚ÄúHow is it mean?‚Äù ‚Äúykw forget it‚Äù I spent that night crying on the floor and i selfharmed. I do not know what‚Äòs wrong with me. I just felt like they didn‚Äôt care, just like he never did. I don‚Äôt know. I truly don‚Äôt understand either.  
so i left everyone, all my online friends, my partner. My best friend. I miss my best friend. My rock, my light, my life. My atlantis, as they said. my true family. My support system, the one who was always there.  
i just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore. It was for the better, they would all be better off without me.  
im ill, and broken, and a bad person, ugly and stupid, and truly, no one truly would want me. They say they do but i know better. They are better off without me.  
it hasn‚Äôt even been that long since i left and im so fucking done with everything. I feel so empty. I don‚Äôt even know, i feel nothing and everything at the same time. I still feel like im living 2 lives. One in my head, in the internet. The other with my family, the real world.  
Sometimes i regret leaving and sometimes im glad. All the times i wish i was dead.  
I don‚Äôt even cry anymore. I just cannot feel enough to cry. Like I genuinely can‚Äôt, i tried, but i cannot. Every single day i wish i was dead. I have no future in life. I want to study abroad, in canada or something, but my mother truly does not believe in me. I do not believe in myself. I have no money and it‚Äôs illegal for minors to work where i live. I‚Äôll try to do well in school in the future but im not so sure. A scholarship is not very easy to get. I don‚Äôt want to stay here, i want to leave. I can‚Äôt stand it here anymore.  
for everyday of my life, i am trying. For every person, i tried to be the sunshine and make them happy. Let them lean on me i tried to be their light. I loved it and i was happy but i need that too. Everyday, slowly that light in me dwindled. Im scared it does not exist anymore, im scared i‚Äôll never reach that kind, happy, cheerful, go-lucky girly person again. Im broken and a mess. And this is pathetic I know. Im pathetic. Maybe its my fault, i never really allowed myself to be vulnerable. I remember letting my siblings cry in my arms but i never cried in theirs. But im the oldest after all, i guess it only makes sense. Im supposed to be strong. Im trying. I wish i could muster to take pills and leave them. They are my only reason for staying. I have given up on everyone, i have no one in my life. Maybe i‚Äôll do it when they don‚Äôt need me anymore.

if you read all of this, thank you and im sorry, especially if this post is all over the place. I tried. Please don‚Äôt be like me",1
"I‚Äôm not a troll this is genuinely what I‚Äôve been going through the past 2 years.

I‚Äôm nearly 18 and 2 years ago when I was 16 I was in a really bad place. I was depressed and isolated myself in my room every single day for nearly the whole year. I was dealing with other issues at the time which led to this. I had been watching porn 1-2 times a day since I was 10  but when I isolated myself it went up to 2-3 times a day. I always knew I was straight and never thought differently. I have seen gay porn and trans porn before and it doesn‚Äôt turn me on at all as I don‚Äôt like it.

When I was depressed and watched a lot of porn, I ended up looking at pictures of a feminine looking man that was in a bikini and had surgery to look like a woman. There was no nudity involved and I was only focusing on the butt nothing else. I did this a few more times over the next few months (probably only another 5 times within 3-4 months). 

After the last time, the regret suddenly sunk in and since then I‚Äôve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and honestly I hate myself for doing this stuff.

I‚Äôm not trying to be homophobic. I just always knew I was straight. Since I realised my actions, I look at the pictures to see if I‚Äôm still aroused by them, but each time I am disgusted by them.

I feel straight again and I honestly do not ever desire to look at those pictures ever again, but I also feel like I am unable to be straight again after the actions I had done in the past.

Is it possible for me to be straight like I was before? I genuinely do not have any desire to do it again and I regret it so much. I‚Äôve been suicidal for nearly two years I just can‚Äôt cope with what I had done.

I‚Äôm not trolling or anything I‚Äôm being genuine. 

Sorry for sounding like a bigot or a troll honestly I did this to myself and now I don‚Äôt want to live.",1
"I'm so pathetic and tired. I failed a suicide attempt about 2 months ago, yet another thing I can't fucking do right, but that's not really the point of this post. That was just a tiny rant.

As the title states, I have a constant, insatiable need for attention and validation. I'm miserable in every single one of my friendships because of this. Nothing is ever enough, I feel like shit. I get suicidal whenever one friend is picked over me, whenever someone doesn't respond, etc.
But I've been getting better at ignoring these emotions, kinda. 

I want a romantic relationship more than anything. I'm tired of ""waiting for it to come to me"". I'm tired of hearing about how ""I should become comfortable on my own before entering a relationship."" It's all fucking stupid. I've spent most of my life completely isolated, I don't need anymore time to myself.
I want to be someone's everything. I want someone who will love me more than anything and give me that constantly validation, but that's just unrealistic. I can't live with this feeling forever, but the only thing that can fix it isn't feasible or healthy.",1
"I‚Äôm 17f and have been dealing with suicidal ideation on and off for years. I started recently with a therapist where I suggested inpatient therapy as an option, which she refused to entertain because she thinks I don‚Äôt need it. Lately I‚Äôve been dealing with a recent breakup and the death of my childhood dog, which have exacerbated things but were definitely not the source of my ideation by any means. I‚Äôm at my breaking point now because (~3 weeks) after my breakup with my ex 18m my friends have started ignoring and excluding me. My ex broke up with me initially because he said he was exhausted with my extremely intense emotions, mood swings, and depression which was an extremely deep cut because he was the person I trusted the most to confide in these things with. I loved him and when I hit a low point after my dog died he said he couldn‚Äôt be with me anymore. I‚Äôve been working through it slowly for the last three weeks, and for the last three weeks I‚Äôve tried to turn to my friends to lean on because it‚Äôs been so difficult and the indifference and coldness from the person I trusted the most has been salt in the wound. Initially they were supportive enough, but now they are excluding me, ignoring me, and giving up on any effort necessary to maintain our friendship. I worry that my ex is perpetuating to them that I‚Äôm a terrible person that they shouldn‚Äôt be around and they‚Äôre all cutting me out because of it, we have a lot of mutual friends since long before we were dating. I‚Äôm just so confused because when we broke up he said he cared about me and hoped my mental state could improve on my own. He made it very clear that there was no bad blood between us and that it just wasn‚Äôt working. I don‚Äôt understand and I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to because I have lost every single person I thought I could count on for help or advice or even just a fucking hug. I want to die more than anything else, I have the means to kill myself in my house and I could do it tonight, but the idea of my mom blaming herself and my dad, brother, sister, grandpa, cousins, having to bury me holds me back. They‚Äôve never been great shoulders to cry on and are honestly some of the last people i would go to with my problems but i still love them to death and i don‚Äôt want to die knowing they‚Äôre going to grieve me. I know I won‚Äôt be here to see it but the idea of hurting them like that makes me sick. I want to die more than anything else but I don‚Äôt want to hurt them. what are my options what can i do

i took an edible i keep trying to numb it with weed and alcohol but it doesn‚Äôt do enough. the only time i feel like im at peace is when im asleep. i dont want to be awake i hate being awake and nobody listens. i need a lithium prescription or a fatal car crash and i dont have either",1

"Earlier today I took the metro and all I could think about was that I should go on the rails and wait there for my death. I have a fairly easy life yet all I can manage to do is be a shitty person and a disappointment to everyone. I thought I was getting better but I never will. Even if I did somehow get better I'll always find a way to ruin everything on a whim. I'm afraid to do it, the thought of my body being crushed disgusts me, but I think about it all the time. I pray often though it's more of a compulsion than anything, if there is a god I'm sure they despise me.",1
"I am extremely unhappy/stressed with life, with being worked to the bone just to get by. I'm tired of being held to a higher standard than some other people then when something goes wrong it's on me. Besides my girlfriend of 17yrs I don't know why I even stick around. Seems like I'm a pawn in a game of chess disposable useless. I'm M33yo and also can't stop thinking of the first 16 years of my life being verbally, mentally and physically abused. Sometimes I do self harm just to feel something, dragging a straight blade down my arm just enough to get blood flowing. If I owned a firearm I feel like I would've already ended it. I'm damaged goods, what's the point of sticking around when I feel I have no purpose. I Basically have no family, everything I've done amounts to nothing at the end. I'm not going to be able to have children. I'm never gonna own my own home. My life's future just seems so bleak, Just seems easier to give up. I'm just ready for the suffering to be over. ",1
I can‚Äôt do this any longer. I moved in with my boyfriend now fianc√©. My relationship is basically over I feel unloved and we fight everyday. When I moved in I ran away from a physical emotional mental and sexual abuisive household. When we break up which will be soon I have nowhere to go. He‚Äôs all I have and left everything hung else for him. I voces all concerns and fall to deaf ears or lead to more arguments. I told him about my rape and my suicidal thaoughts and all he says is no. I‚Äôm a catholic I know I‚Äôm going to hell. I‚Äôm tired ,1
"Ive gotten to this point to where im tired of it all. I look at indeed and see no jobs that i can phyiscally go to without help from family to go to and family wont help me and buses are too dangerous for anyone to get on for a job. Im just done with living, im done with struggling like this. 

  
I wanted to have a job, i wanted to a have a normal family, and i cant have these things so the best thing i can hope for is that after i eat my last fill of food and drink some whiskey and coke. Im just going to cut my throat and just bleed out in my bathroom so that way its easy for someone to clean for my life isnt worth living. 

  
I dont want to live a life where i grow old and just have food stamps forever. I just want to die. Today is a good day to die. Ive wrote my will, ive send aside all my stuff for my friend who is like my sister to me, and i wrote her a heartfelt letter to not take any pain in my death and let me go as it hurt to be here in this world. I loved very very few people in my life and those very few have shown me a kindness ill never have from the majority. 

I cant continue like this, this is not a way for a man to live in a world like this. I live like a beggar that wants to get a job and everyone denys me while at the same time calling me lazy and stubborn. 

It doesnt really matter what i say because everyone will impose their view onto me without even knowing who, what, and why i am what i am.

No job, dating being straight fucking shit, pain of my body constantly hurting me and my mind causing intense paranoia. I do not want to live in this body and the solution is not calling 988 as i have called them many times before, all the resources have not helped and im not going subject myself to going into a ward to be abused further and being pushed down with pills.",1

"I'm honestly just here to vent.

Recently I got into a very minor traffic accident,  literally just a fender bender, but it was so triggering for me that I attempted (and failed miserably due to using an ineffective method) . Not just the accident itself was triggering, but the girl I hit called her uncle, (who was a fucking former prosecuter) over it and she decided to make me go to court because of him!!!! :D nobody in my family went to college or knows the law. How is that fair??  so anyway I went to court, and then I had to take a driving class where for some reason the police Sergent is allowed to show a bunch of 16-24 year olds real gore of real people dying in wrecks!!! :D I was the only person there who wasn't there for going 20 over the fucking speed limit!!! :D

I also am so fucking stupid and braindead that I managed to forget to appear in court last Thursday to simply acknowledge that i listened to an old geezer complain about how hard it is to be a cop and scrape peoples bodies off of hot pavement. I'm gonna call the court clerk in about three hours and see if I can fix it today. I won't get any sleep tonight. I would've if I could've forgotten for just a little while longer.

 After that, I have to drive almost an hour away to visit some office for a new job which will pay me barely enough money to live, take money out of my check to pay for licensing or something and health insurance. I remember when I first heard someone say that 15/hr was the bare minimum of what you need to live off of and thinking 15 was a lot. It's low. It's nothing, actually.

 I'm gonna go to college in the fall, on top of a full time overnight job, so that I can get some useless degree, because no matter which major I choose I feel like every market is flooded and I'll just end up making people's coffee.

 Especially considering that all I want to be in life is an artist. All I care about is creating art. But unfortunately, I feel like there are so many talented people that mine would be lost in the noise. I'm good at it but so is everyone else, including fucking AI apparently. I told someone that I was gonna major in graphic design and they deadass laughed in my face and told me to do something else because of ai. By the way, I think that people who can't tell the difference between ai and genuine art at least 80 percent of the time should not be allowed to vote.

And the worst part is I don't want either type of work, coffee or cushy. And I don't understand why that is so controversial to say. Why do you people dream of sucking off your bosses? I just want to swim in the lake by the dock with my best friends. I want to get a house for all of us to live in. I want to have fun and be young like I've never had the chance to before.

But I won't be able to afford that, because apparently the generations before mine were too retarded to create a sustainable and functioning economic system. The same people who care more about trumps stupid ear than 35,000 dead Palestinian people. The same people who literally unironically think Donald Trump was sent by God to ""save america"". From what?? Civil rights? And don't even get me started on how hot it's getting outside. Or how they keep finding microplastics in placentas.

I'm just so fucking angry because I just got here and everything is too fucking expensive. Old people complain about prices, but you at least had some time before during non recession periods to save something up. I have nothing. Once my grandma dies I will have nowhere to live, and I will have to scrap and struggle for every dime. And I never even got to be a teenager because of a fucking plague. I had no fun. I haven't even had my first kiss yet. The world is burning, and the only way I know how to solve my problems is by dragging a blade across my skin. I can't save anyone.",1
Im a 19yo male who recently took the university entrance exams this morning the results came in and i fucked up big time btw my mom is looking after me cause my dad is a fucking alcoholic no life and after the results my mom contacted every single friend of hers whose children also took the exams and now she's screaming and threatening me about how the other children did it and im a worthless piece of shit can't take it no more cause i really tried my absolute hardest to study but in the end its for nothing anyone take care yall,1

Got married, went active duty military, then got out. Struggled to get my head on straight for years, got therapy, meds, thought I was making great progress until recently.

Finally I was on track for a degree and a pathway to a field I‚Äôm interested in. Until I found out me from high school apparently fucked over me today. Gpa and act score isn‚Äôt high enough for the program I want to get into so now what??  Idk I‚Äôve had setbacks before but this just sent me over the edge. And it‚Äôs not like I picked my major mindlessly this was my third time for this era of my life and after so much damn research. After all the research and planning and my dad and grandma talking shit behind my back about me needing a job and not just wasting my life just being a wife now what?

It‚Äôs like no matter what plan I create for myself the universe tells me to fuck off. I‚Äôm so over life it‚Äôs not even funny at this point. Maybe to those who predicted I would never amount to crap.

i keep doubting my worth you know,  
maybe i have always been a duck up.  
why do i keep trying to justify it?  
now that i am all alone, i found so little of me, i don't even know where to start from this again and again.  
i feel like i have never will escape from feeling like this again, you i have always been the first to look for help i have had therapy before, they had told me that there is a high chance im surrounded by egoisitc people.  
you know being emotional as a man is not well treated.  
or worse now that i am a father.  
i hate the fact that i am failing them you know my baby girls.  
im just afraid that they will treat me as their mom will you know.  
your mom the one that doesn't let me parent because shes a perfectionist.  
im the best dad from our family, i am the dad that is trusted to stay with them.  
but im always short, i have learned not to take it personal, but know that i have removed your mom from telling me this one way or another, now i am an absentee father. what i have never wanted to be. i have been dealing with these for months and the thought of this has been paralysing me just like it is now that i have taken action. so i don't know whats best, being with your mom and being depressed or mom being alone and depressed.

I am able to find jobs, you know my dad has, he has been supporting me for a while now, because he is good, but he has also been the person to hurt me the most you know, i haven't been working for awhile now, patience runs thin, and i haven't been able to find support, one of my friend left, because i gave him the idea, i know for a fact. haha and i don't have friends, in my mental health journey i decided that i would focus on my family. since i appreciated all their support, but at the same time i never was able to carry my own weight. i only did when we were young, i am the eldest, and when we were in the house as kids i worked and gave mostly to my family i wasn't able to save, it always came back to the house.

so now im just here whining and crying about how unfair life is, when it hasn't been unfair. i have been blessed many times, but i just wasted them, paralyzed.

Almost a month ago I lost my childhood 13 years old dog, and after that everything came back to me &lt;- this is a very important thing to see the world fromy my side

At The beginning of 2020 I was super stresfull abot the virus, it took me like 2 or 3 month to function like a normal person.

After that, the UA vs RU happened and I think it's destroyed my mind completely. I wasn't able to think about anything else busides the war that is happening near my country border.
About 1 to 1.5 year later I was able to function normally like with the virus, but the war thing was a way worse. 
I was wiking up in the middle of the night hearing the freaking tanks or air raid siren (it was in my head only), I had to took some sleeping pills to be able to sleep over 6 hours.

And now, after my dog died - everything came back to me. Now I'm even afraid of freaking thunders (I was never afraid of them).

I'm paranoid almost about everything.
I was talking with psychologist 2 or 3 days after my dog died, she just told me that I'm a strong person and I just need some time.

Almost a month ago, everything is still very hard for me, sometimes even harder than after the sad news.

I don't really know what I should do, I have ultra mixed feelings - but I don't feel the happiness as I use to felt it before everything.

If someone had similar experience, please help me because I'm really loosing my mind ;(",1
"i‚Äôm such a kind and soft and gentle person. people come up to me and call me an angel and tell me i‚Äôm a nice calming presence.

it‚Äôs like when a cat sees a fish in a bowl. a boy sees an ant. a hawk sees a kitten. there‚Äôs that need to torture and kill something so defenseless. it‚Äôs a part of the circle of life. sadly, for me, it‚Äôs the curse of being the predator and the prey. i‚Äôm too kind to hurt anything else, but something needs to hurt. i have to be the destroyer and the destroyed. 

im not exactly religious, but i think that there is some sort of cosmic reason for everything. i think i was put on this earth and met the people i‚Äôve met for a reason. i want to have a positive impact on everyone around me. sadly my sacrifice is my own vessel. even though i don‚Äôt think i was meant to be here for very long, i want to leave this world a better place than i found it.

My own father tells me he'll just watch me hang myself, every small thing i say or do, even just one small action have this whole ass story for them it pisses me off so much i can't even go out of my room to eat, yes it's one of that asian parents thing, they literally live in their manufactured drama bs and then shoves it down my throat. its gotten so bad to the point of accusing me of outrageous things or making me confess to shit I didn't even do, they're just pulling shit out of thin air.

my father also never finished school (all of his siblings finished) but then he tells me ""IT'S THE DESTINY THAT DID THIS DADADADA, AIN'T MY FAULT"" then proceeds to blame my freaking existence to god telling me it's god that wanted us to be born not him like man unless our mother is god damn virgin mary right there our mom don't just get pregnant without you having sex with her or wanting to have kids with her, oh yeah my eyes are also extremely bad i couldn't even read a letter properly from 5 feet away, they won't buy me glasses because they think i just want to look like a smart ass and they don't believe my hearing problems while thinking u jjust don't want to comply with what they tell me then they think I'm abnormal while they themselves overthink and over react so much, my step mother also on his side because who am i to her, just a guy who she feels obligated to take care of, he would often look for things about me that's ""not good enough"" just so he could get mad and strat yapping his whole ass out of his mouth.

he also thinks I'm gay just because I don't go outside (that's not a joke he seriously had a conversation with me about that but even after explaining myself and how going outside doesn't make you straight he concludes that i am indeed gay, spoiler alert, i am not), then he starts trying to argue out of nowhere blaming me for his own faults like ""only if you were there but you weren't so it's your fault even though you're taking a dump when it happened it's your fault"" and whatever my brother does that's wrong I'm still included when i have got nothing to do with that situation but when it's only me it's just me.

TL;DR - Father doesn't believe me, accuses me shit and makes me confess to it, my brother's wrong I'm involved, my fault only me, finds things about me to get mad about, thinks everything his mind tells him is true, paranoid as hell, and i got nowhere to run,

school's about to start, planning to skip the first day to end it all. this is unbearable but any tips would help coming from y'all.",1
"Hello everyone,

I've never used the internet this way, but today I hope it will be beneficial because I really feel that I need it. Let's start...

I am a young man, an only child, who recently turned 20. I lived with my father and mother until I was 19, but one day my mother left home for another man. This affected me greatly because we were a very close-knit family of three, and it affected my father even more. Today, it's almost been five months since I found my father deceased by suicide. That day, he left me a letter that I will simplify: he told me that he adored me and that I couldn't even imagine how much, and that he was very proud of me. He then told me to never stop, to continue and reach my dreams, and that he would always be there with me, anywhere, anytime, he would accompany me. But he also said something: he was sorry for not being the father I would have wanted. Yet he knew very well how proud I was of him and how much I loved him. He was the center of my universe. But knowing my father, he always wanted more for his family and convinced himself that he wasn't good for me. But if he knew how perfect he was in my eyes...

Today, I live with my uncle (my father's brother) and my cousins. Why am I not with my mother? Because everything happened so quickly: my mother, the loss of my father... It wasn't the right time for me to live with her and her new man. And recently, I learned from a reliable source that she had cheated on my father before leaving him, so I am very confused with everything I'm going through. I know that time will heal things, but time moves forward for me and no longer for my father, and that enrages me.

Now, the real reason for this post is that I too am now thinking about ending this life of suffering. There's not a day that goes by without me thinking about it. Currently, I only continue for my father, my family, and my friends... but what about me in all this? When I sit down and take two minutes, I really struggle to see the beauty in this life. Yes, I have dreams and ambitions, but it seems like nothing makes sense anymore, everything tastes nostalgic... I've thought of ways to end it and the places, but only in thought, so I haven't taken any actions yet, but I feel it could happen... I want to live, but I have such a bitter taste from my experience on this earth now. When I argue, for example with my uncle, even over simple things, I automatically think: what's the point in continuing? I realize that I'm really staying here for my loved ones. I could probably write to you endlessly, but I'll stop here for now. It did me good to write this. Thank you for reading, everyone.",1

"I've been fighting with my girlfriend a lot lately. She never wants to talk. Is stressed out by everything. I just want to support her, but I can't help her if she doesn't know what's wrong. She makes me feel bad for wanting to spend time with her or telling her I love her. We haven't had physical or emotional intimacy in about a month.

Truth be told I don't know what happened. We are in a poly relationship. She had another relationship end recently. Part of our rules were that we just don't talk about our jealousy issues. I suspect she's just not telling me anything because she's worried ill make it about myself. I know its too late for that. 

I told her today that I'd be there whenever she does want to talk. That it doesn't have to be today or tomorrow.

But every day fills me with more and more and more sadness and what feels like my relationship just falling apart. Its hard. We both need therapy. We both need communication and support. She at least has friends. I have nothing like that. If she stops talking to me about things I just don't even wants to think about it.

If i lose her... I would just want to end things instantly. I just wants this fucking sadness to go away. I want somebody to tell me its okay to tell my girlfriend I love her and that its okay to feel sad about the distance that has grown between us. I get that whatever happened wasn't because of me and that I'm making it about myself now.  I'm a selfish piece of shit who just wants my girlfriend to be happy and that would make me happy.

"33M early child hood trauma ruined my life before it even started 


I honestly don't know where to start, but for background my mom left when I was probably in 1st or 2nd grade, just straight up moved to England ""mom is moving to england love you bye"" and left me with an abusive father. Dad taught me about porn at around age 8 or 9. I was molested by three different individuals (sons, or nephews of women he dated) between ages of most likely 11-14. One of them actually tw raping me. 

I've always been shorter in stature, and was picked on all throughout school. Something that did not help, as well was that my dad had a habit of approaching any girl around my age, in public to ask them if they wanted to date me. This started happening around 4th grade. ( Around the time my dad introduced me to porn). He would approach almost any girl, rather it be someone at the grocery store, it be someone selling girl scout cookies, it could be cheerleaders but he would do this routinely to the point that I would be ridiculed at school for this behavior. Of course, these girls would decline, or be like ew no gross, and I was often ""fake asked out"" a lot and would have things thrown at me, or like chocolate milk dumped on my head. This lead to a very strong fear of women, and fear of rejection I still deal with. 

My dad was also verbally, and emotionally, and physically abusive. If I would talk back he would shove me against a wall, and put his forearm against my throat and slap me, spit in my mouth, lick my face. He would tell me that no one would love me, and would use the girls going ew gross as examples and proof. I was also physically weaker than most other kids my age, due to a neurological condition that caused me to be under-developed, lacked coordination. 

One of my primary outlets, has always been the computer. Anime, video game type stuff. Fantasy stuff.  A habit I had picked up, was chatroom roleplaying in the late 90s, early 2000s in the AOL/Yahoo days, that started when I lived with my dad. I eventually ran away, to a different state, where a girl I was speaking with I had a crush on lived where my mom had moved back to and my grandma lived. I continued this habit after I moved, the summer after my freshman year and because I didn't know anyone I kept the habit of really having a majority of my social life on yahoo chat/aol.  

I was eventually groomed by an older woman, when I was like 16 into liking femdom type roleplay. This mostly hit a few dopamine receptors in whatever my most likely un-diagnosed autistic brain where I didn't have to ""guess"" if a girl was into me or not, if she was the one ""bossing"" me around. 

I stopped talking to this woman, my junior year, after a girl I went to school with admitted to liking me and we talked and dated for an extremely short time, all of it ending when she kissed me and I froze completely mostly due to being a completely anxious buffoon, but also due to my body having a fear/anxiety response from all the previous trauma/molestation where I just completely froze. She stopped talking to me not long after, and started calling me a pussy after I revealed some of the previous information about my past/dad to her as to ""why"" I froze. Also because I was 17 almost 18 and this was the first girl, and I still think only girl, to ever actually show any genuine interest me and I still regret dropping the ball on this. ( Though, she was known as a serial cheater, has 3 different baby daddy's now but I hold no ill will to her as she has had an extremely hard laugh and I ""recognized her scars"" which is why I fell for her back then. )

To be honest, high school after I moved was 10000x better and I actually came out of my shell even though I still had a lot of healing to do, unfortunately with a neglectful mom, and step-dad who didn't recognize, or care to recognize obvious signs of needing therapy. ( mom didn't know about the extent of the abuse back then, just the physical, but I still should have been in therapy. ) 

After highschool, and going to college I did get a car thankfully gifted to me from an older woman in my grandmas community. But I was 100% locked down to the house and could hardly go anywhere. (This was around 2010 and job market in my area sucked and I didn't actually get a job until 2014. mostly because I went to college but no job experience early on even for McDonalds wouldn't hire me, really hurt me, also because I was a quiet/nervous stammering idiot. )  

Eventually during college because my parents didn't allow me to go anywhere, took my keys etc, I fell back into habits of going online, and roleplaying. A user from the yahoo days had made a site for roleplay that was adult oriented though I rarely did anything of that except with people I had written with for awhile, and I started going there again. This is an action I regret to this day. 

Eventually, some drama started between me, and a different user where he started posing as me instigating drama/telling people I was drama. He accused me of harassing myself, eventually proved this wasn't the case, but drama from him posing as me continued, and eventually linked back to an account that was a more smut/sex RP account that was extremely oriented to violence against women, non-con, type writing (meaning he wanted someone to write as a woman for him to basically abuse.) Not kink shaming, but dude was/is a weirdo. Exposed this fact that the account was his and I started receiving threats that he was going to ruin my life. 

For years on that site I had him posing as me, stealing characters I made and making profiles as them to pose as me, mass spamming/block evading people posing as me to stir drama, to the point that he also found out information about me IRL and harassed IRL friends.

I lost a lot of friends due to the nature of the harassment, and the drama surrounding it. My response to it. ( A lot of validation seeking, are you mad at me, it isn't me please believe me type stuff. I was probably 24-ish around this time. ) Around this time, I had actually gone to the cops, but was given nothing more than a cyberbullying pamphlet. Told they couldn‚Äôt help me. Contact the FBI, I did but never got a response. There was also a rape accusation as well where my female friends were messaged from someone saying "" OP raped my friend"".  I went to a lawyer about this, and because I was a dirt-poor college student at the time and as no actual criminal accusation had been made was to ignore it. Was told specifically "" you'd be a fucking idiot to walk into a police station and say "" i got accused of rape, but its a lie please help me "" you'd be stuck in jail "" and because I couldn't afford a criminal lawyer, nor a lawyer to help me with the false accusations it was best to just drop it. 

I stopped taking care of myself, I gained over 70lbs probably over the course by just not caring. Not going out, because I didn‚Äôt want to run into people like I knew who were harassed, or other individuals who were targeted and have these things brought up, because as a nervous, shy guy, with a stutter if I was confronted, I didn‚Äôt have proof of any of the stuff at the time, I didn‚Äôt want to admit ‚Äúoh yeah I was groomed as a kid, and later as an adult started going on a cyber/smut roleplay site for adults where a psycho stalker got mad I outed him for liking to do rape stories and decided to ruin my life because I found out hes a freak‚Äù because that would have resolved the situation, or not have completely scared people off. As well, I'm sure a lot of people just got tired of me, and cut me out due to A) I‚Äôm a friend who betrayed their trust, and crossed boundaries, B) I‚Äôm a vile person who cannot be trusted or C) there is too much drama surrounding me, rather true, or not where it isn‚Äôt worth the risk to them to interact with me and the possible exposure, or risk to themselves it might bring.

I see people walking down the street with a large group looking so happy or people smiling while talking on the phone or doing the most mundane activities they still are being happy. I can‚Äôt find one thing that brings true happiness. I knew from a very young age that I did not want to be alive. I believe from the age 11 was when I really noticed how much I hate it. How much I despise waking up every goddamn morning. I hate all of it. I just don‚Äôt want to feel like this no more. I want total peace. I want all this to be gone. ",1
"My ex gf has lied to me and manipulated me to the point that she got me fired, I have no other friends, and I'm stuck living with her until I either die or by some miracle find a good paying job in my area that will be enough to pay my bills and let me save enough to get out. I've been trying to find work for almost a year now, so that's not likely. 

When I'm home, she starts an argument over literally anything she can. Today it was because she was excited and accidentally screamed in my ear. I politely asked her to stop yelling, and then was told I'm an asshole because I had an attitude (I really, really didn't. I don't have the energy to argue.) 
This happens every day. Every single day she comes up with a new way to make me feel like I'm worth nothing, and she won. I don't have any other way out of this hell than death. But of course i can't even buy the things I need to unalive, so that feels great too. At this point I'm considering taking every pill we have in the apartment. It won't be pretty but at least I won't be suffering anymore.

I remember years ago thinking if can only go up from here but things have gotten worse.

I only stay alive because my medication helps me and I have a dog.

I am a disappointment to everyone and especially to myself.

I have so much potential but yet nothing I have tried has panned out and I feel cursed. I no longer want to try or put effort into anything. It all goes downhill and never works out for me.

Others my age have families and children and friends and a career but my career prospects have just been ripped away from me and I don‚Äôt know what to do and I feel disillusioned.

I am not good at anything because mental illness has stolen a decade of my life and robbed me of my hobbies and interests. I am shell of who I used to be and I am numb to everything.

I want to kill myself or go to a mental facility but I don‚Äôt know what will happen to my dog if I go away for several days and if I commit suicide my dog will be sad.

I just don‚Äôt know how I can be this much of a failure even though I have tried. Maybe I didn‚Äôt try hard enough maybe I should have been better with my money and my mental health and shouldn‚Äôt have let the bad things that happened to me lead me down this path. I don‚Äôt know.

All the things people have told me to do to become happier hasn‚Äôt worked and I just give up now and fantasize about killing myself but I don‚Äôt want to go to hell and I worry about my parents not recovering and blaming themselves and also my dog will be sad.

I wish I could just cease to exist and feel nothing but not harm anyone just exist in a comatose state that I can‚Äôt wake up from. 

I wish everyone would leave me alone so I wouldn‚Äôt disappoint them any further. 

I have a great relationship with my boyfriend that I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve and I will screw up like everything else in my life because I don‚Äôt have any effort to be a better girlfriend. He deserves so much better than me and I am a disappointment. I just want to die more when I think about these things.

My boyfriend hung himseff because of this, left me in debit holding the bag. They forclosed on my house, but lienholder said I could stay and rent it. The owner died, left him her millions, and iimmediately wants to sell it. After he bought it for $75,000 and being a contractor,  remolded everthing, so it now worth $375,000 so he wants to make money, now! Im waiting for my notice to get out. And have no family to go too. Or talk to, we had each other.

 I cant even do laundry, or have a car, he bought me a new car for us, I couldn't afford his car and his truck. I have to get car rides with strangers and it's a 2 hour drive to the drs.

 I am on disability,  for many conditions, he took care of me, now I have no one. I live in the seirras and we did all the landscaping have a guest house i went to cause it was too much to sit what was his house. But they can live off $1040 a month. I already had severe anxiety,  agoraphobia,  your house is your safe spot. But rent is too high, only a bedroom to rent with 3 cats and a dog. We used to throw the ball down the hill 3 times and he was pooped, but living in a room in a city with roomstes and a big fog, 3 cats that are indoor only, they are scared of people, they try to sneak out. I will be a prisoner in a bedroom with no bathroom with ibd, so if you gotta go, u cant wait for people to get out of the bathroom,  been there, done that, its HORRIBLE.  Im now 55, can't rock out in my bedroom, cant have pets. They are all i have. 

You think you're lives are bad, i owe $65,000 he was paying, but now gone. It was for the house. And they're complaining about food. Eat less like me.

I think theres many more reason's to want to die.

"This year has been the worst year for me. I had to leave the city that I loved, along with the community and friends I had, and move back home due to visa issues and my parents' health. I‚Äôm now faced with the possibility of changing careers (I worked in film) to support my wife and child, as it's not stable or lucrative here. This might mean abandoning my dream of becoming a film director due to external pressures( i come from a conservative community so film is looked down upon), and I‚Äôve been feeling like a failure seeing all my old friends and relatives in higher positions while I struggle to stay financially afloat every day.

I thought this would be the year I finally made the film I worked so hard to write and assemble a team for (I've been pretending that I‚Äôm doing well and have just been focused on my film this year). However, it‚Äôs been impossible to juggle my dreams with having a family, addressing my parents' needs, finishing our house repairs, finding a potential job to make money, working on my film, and dealing with other personal emotional problems. 

This year, everything has fallen apart, and it has felt like a battle. Nothing has been simple, and I‚Äôm tired. I tried following my dreams, but I‚Äôm starting to doubt my abilities and whether I‚Äôll ever reach where I want to be in life or be able to give my family the life they deserve. Maybe I‚Äôm too old to make it; maybe I missed my chance. 

I imagine life would be easier if my wife had married someone else and not me, a failed artist, or if I died so they could move on without needing to support me and my unrealistic dreams and expectations in life, maybe i‚Äôm just another failed dreamer that wasn‚Äôt tough enough to go all they way or able to sacrifice to make his dreams real because i‚Äôm weak... it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore i just want to kill all my ambitions, goals and dreams so i make life easier for myself and everyone around me.

"Came out as gay at 30 and it wasn't received well
I'm now 32 and still not fully out. 
I have had lesbian sex and it's some of the best sex of my life-- if anything I can say I at least had that already! 

I've been abandoned by my family - mother is a malignant narcissist who only cares about image and my enabling coward father and sister wouldn't stand up for me and none of them give a fuck about my human dignity or if I live or die. My mother attempted to eradicate  my soul.

My college best friend who I was in love with is catholic and now engaged to a man. We could never be together in reality but I feel like she used me for emotional closeness and never truly was able to validate my love for her. She told me she loves me but I feel entirely invalidated as a human being by her.

My only hope is that I'm going to be getting onto weight loss drugs soon and am going to get into therapy and start the healing process but I don't think I'll ever fully feel normal again after being discarded by my heartless family and watching the love of my life marry a man and start a life with him. I know our love and the feelings we have towards each other are much more real in comparison to what she has with this average man but I am being eaten alive by the fact he gets to have her and i prob won't see her again for years. He only got her because he has a dick and I don't. If I had been born a man I'd get to be with her forever. Like-- none of it was real yet it was all real to me. Sometimes I don't  think she truly cares if I exist or not. I also think she's a covert narcissst or a sociopath idk. She's the only woman who truly knows me but I haven't started to date women yet who are out of the closet and comfortable in their sexuality. She was my ""pre coming out"" love. I think about her 24/7 and my thoughts have been consumed by her for 5 years. We still message each other every day despite her being engaged to the man. I'm sure she prob liked me but she could never act on the feelings I guess... it's horrible. I want to consume her in every way.

I've put my all into these relationships and received barely anything in return. I've been isolating myself for a while. I don't feel like my existence on this earth matters anymore and it's a very chilling feeling. What's the point anymore. I was everything I could be and it was never enough for anyone!

"My problem is simple: I recently graduated from college, and every day I‚Äôm increasingly convinced that my life will never amount to the kind I hoped I‚Äôd have. Every day I believe more strongly that I‚Äôll never find a good job. Rejection after rejection is proving to me what I‚Äôve always believed deep down: this world has no use for me. I feel like I‚Äôll never contribute anything meaningful to society because I‚Äôm not as smart, charismatic, good-looking, physically fit, or wealthy as so many other people out there who are far more qualified than I am to have or do anything that I could ever want for myself. There are men out there who are taller, smarter, more athletic, wealthier, and kinder than I am, so my worth in society is objectively low, as is the likelihood that I will find a satisfying job that meets my absurdly high expectations for life. There are people more deserving of my life and the life I want than I am.

If it weren‚Äôt for the possibility of hurting my family, I think I‚Äôd just do it. I‚Äôve always thought about how people would react to my death, and while I think my friends would move on unscathed given enough time, I feel immensely guilty for just thinking about doing something that would hurt my family so deeply. Then again, I‚Äôd rather them remember me as I am right now than watch me devolve into the complete and utter failure that I fear I‚Äôm becoming.

But the fact animal abuse goes on, and it's basically legal, and there's nothing much I can do about it, cause I know it's not going to change because MOST people are cruel, greedy and selfish.

"With trump being shot and basically securing a massive landslide to win

I genuinely don't see a point anymore. I live in Australia and our poltics always reflect amercias so next year I'm sure libreal (right wing party) will win and get into parliment and even if they don't it will probably be labour (slightly less right wing)

I look at whats happening in gaza and Congo and ukraine and just can't process how the fuck I'm supposed to do anything to help.

I'm bi and nonbinary i was amab so already life is hard to a degree but i also live rural so if right wing parties get in all over the worlf my life is done for I'd have to go back to suppressing myself because the world just simply refuses to have empathy for people thay don't feel and look like them.

I'm also a musician but i suck ass most of my songs are just mish mashs of grunge songs i like and even ones i think i completely original end up sounding like another band. My lyrics are bland my guitar playing sucks .

I have a slew of undiagnosed shit and i dont know whats actually wrong with me. 

My friends all live 2 states away and i only see them 2 times a year. I work for macdonalds because  its the only place in my town that doesnt pay under the books that hired me. I have made 0 friends in 2 years and every time i try im let down. Recently me and this girl i was helping cheat fell out and her bf at the time revealed how much she was lying to me about and i was fine with it because i didnt like him but after we sat down and talk i couldn't find reasons to hate him and i jjst feel so fucking guilty


Ive come from the right wing 15 year old boy pipeline all the way and yet it feels like for all my changing all im doing is just trying to makeup for shit i did in the past. Ive tried so hard to help the people around me change and research and as soon as i think im maming progress something happans and all that progress is lost. 

I just feel so hopeless and like every step of progress is just another step back

Capatlism is destorying me i find it so hard to work even a simple job because i just want to be alive without the stress of needing money for stuff.

Ive made plans to aquire euthanasia drugs and to kill myself at a park up from my house. My friend tried to talk me down but in my head its just a burning thought even if i dont want it. Ive struggled witj impulsive thoughts alot but this one isnt impulsive it just wont leave.  

I genuinely feel like my future doesn't matter and i see no point to living if i cant live how i want to live. Im so tired of conforming so that i can have a couple of hours of non conformity.",1

"I create reasons to live. The meaning of life is to give life meaning. I bought a pet. That buys me 10-15 years of obligatory life. Now, I experience moments of intense fear, shame, guilt, and hatred where the pet is concerned. Thoughts of rehoming come simultaneously with SI several times a day. 

It is still possible to X while owning the pet. I can leave the pet with a sitter for a week, tell family I‚Äôm on vacation with the hopes of being left alone/not found, and then attempt again. I hate being found.

In the past, I tried to convince myself that I was found for a reason‚Äîthat something good would come of it. Nothing good has happened in my life. Pain and suffering abound! 

The narcissist, the borderline, the histrionic, and the antisocial have all moved on to their next victims. I am left with PTSD, paranoia, and the constant urge to end it. No matter how many docs I see, they say the same: I am a victim, it wasn‚Äôt my fault, I can only move on knowing it wasn‚Äôt my fault, I need to form healthy relationships. 

No one is healthy. My life is more than half over and I have yet to meet a ‚Äòhealthy‚Äô individual. ",1
"I can't do it because I know this is just another occasional feeling, but I want to share it, even if no one cares (which is likely the case). When I get a job, it's from that point on that I'm fucked. From that point on, I'm a pawn that society and power structures will use to benefit themselves and profit off of. I don't feel like I have any kind of individual autonomy in this bitch. I am drawn and forced into a collective group practicing groupthink. I am not regarded as an individual, rather an organism that makes up a goddamn collective that I'm forced to submit to, and if I do anything to benefit myself in the motherfucking goddamn slightest, it's selfish and evil. People only care about what social skills I can showcase to them. People I would in the general sense call ""friends"" are really just people who are drawn towards me because of a certain trait I showcased to them that they grew to like. When I stopped showcasing those traits, they no longer had any interest. So they left. People are naturally selfish. And society forces this creed onto me that I don't agree with, and tells me that what I've grown to resonate with is wrong, self-destructive, and evil. They say that because it's not what they seek, which is optimism and a facade that makes everything look like it's fine and nothing could ever possibly go wrong. If you have 'good' social skills, you will be revered among everyone and be looked at as some kind of charm, but if you have 'bad' social skills or are socially inept, you will be seen as some scary punk who all he ever wanted to do was kill people. You just drive people away. You're undesirable, disgusting, worthless, and just an overall useless retard who could off themselves and no one would care, or those ""remembering"" you would do it in a way that still is not understanding. Society sucks, people suck, life is shit most of the time. I don't care if I'm just a brat whining to some (or most) people. I really don't care anymore.",1
"i‚Äôm a total screw up especially lately. i am a nineteen year old girl and i don‚Äôt think anything will ever get better for me. 

all i‚Äôve been doing is screwing up lately. a few months ago i got my first ever ticket and then on friday i got another one for not stopping completely at a stop sign. i‚Äôm under court supervision for the first one and now i might have to go to court. if my insurance rates go up my parents are going to kill me. my parents don‚Äôt know about it yet but if i don‚Äôt fix it i‚Äôm planning on being gone before then. on friday when i got the other one i came home and went on a walk at 2 in the morning and got really drunk. now i need to hire a traffic lawyer and who knows if i can even afford it and if it would even work.

plus i‚Äôm moving at the beginning of next month but i don‚Äôt know if i can afford it anymore, and i have barely gotten a call back from a few jobs.

the one thing i feel good about is what i do for work. i feel like i‚Äôm doing good working in a memory care unit but now i feel bad at that too.

i feel like i used to be more put together. i feel like i used to be a better person. now i cant even manage to go a week without being a moron. i can‚Äôt keep going on if all i am doing is being a fuck up. 

this is morbid but if i die will my insurance not raise? i feel like it would be one last good thing for me to do",1
"Harsh truths. Gentle truths. I need either at this point.

I have suicide plan ideas, no solid plan yet. I want to die. Hanging did not work back when I was 19, so don't wanna try that. OD is extremely difficult to do, I'm more likely to just get hospitalized for that. I do not like gore so don't want to expose that to someone by shooting myself with my step dads gun or jump off a cliff. On my list is either charcoal burning, jumping into a cold lake hoping for hypothermia/cold water drowning, or purposeful heat stroke (I'm a runner; I imagine this would be easy to do just not pleasant to experience). I know the biggest challenge is my body's natural desire to live, unfortunately.

At the same time I don't know if I am actually going to go through with it. Maybe I wrote out the plans as a coping mechanism - to know it is there in case things hit the fan more than they already have, such as my mom dying from cancer/complications of cancer.

I'm on vacation, without any actual plans. I'm just bopping around. Even on vacation I am painfully depressed. This isn't like me, I usually find adventure and fun in the smallest things and find great joy in the spontaneous and I romanticize the shit about everything and anything.

The other night, I could actually feel the emotional pain where I did not want to breathe anymore.

Some background about me: I have depression/anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD. I also have a clinical doctorate and do not dislike my job, but I'm also in 200k+ debt that will be forgiven if I die. I have been feeling quite isolated in the small town I've been in since last fall. My mom got diagnosed with late stage cancer and while she made it through chemo and radiation, she has been having toxic side effects from immunotherapy and recurrent respiratory failure episodes in which she has had 6 hospital admissions in the last month alone. I am not close to my dad or step dad. I feel lonely and I have no close friends. I'm scared of living a life without my mom. Without my aging cat. Without anyone. Life looks bleak. I'm tired of being the funny person and the one that looks out for people, but all alone once I'm at home. Silence is no longer comforting, but neither is music anymore. Nothing soothes the ache.

I do not enjoy what I usually do. I want to force myself to go out and trail run and boulder, things I love but I just do not anymore. I know these are textbook symptoms of depression. I have the logic to identify what is going on, but that does not make me feel better emotionally. I love the moon and sunsets and now when I look at them, I feel nothing. I have no interest in anything in life.

Yes this is a post for ""attention"" because I want to spend the next hour reading advice or insights to keep me distracted, genuinely. I have nothing else going on. I have plans to go through with this on either the 18th or 20th. But I also have a therapy appointment tomorrow too and yes I will let her know, maybe she will admit me. Maybe that's what I need.",1

"i live on a closed and private urbanization of condos, and around 6:40 pm the group chat of the urbanization went crazy. people were asking to help someone and for someone to please call ambulance. that‚Äôs when i we (my parents and i) started hearing someone screaming outside.

this was a woman, she was crying hard. she was screaming: ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt let this be true‚Äù, ‚Äúsomebody please tell me that is a nightmare‚Äù, ‚Äúplease tell me that my daughter is well‚Äù. all the neighbors were around her trying to help. people called the police and the ambulance, she kept crying and screaming. 

after a few minutes a white car appeared and entered really fast until it came close to the woman screaming. it stopped abruptly and people got out of it. it was family of the girl and her mom.

people approached to the house. 

when the police came, they entered. i was talking to a neighbor who had more context of what was going on. it seems the girl already had some mental health problems. he told me that her mom entered the house but didn‚Äôt found her anywhere -the sad thing is, she‚Äôs a 27 year old that has a baby of 12 to 18 months i would say- she found the baby on the bed undressed (he‚Äôs okay) and the bathroom door locked. she started knocking on it but no answer. that‚Äôs when she realized what was going on and started to cry for help.

around that time the neighbor was telling me that, another of the neighbors happened to be a nurse, so when the police came, the nurse, a cop and a familiar of the girl went into the house. one of them went down and told us to please keep calling the ambulance; the girl seemed to don‚Äôt have any pulse.

they returned upstairs and a few minutes later the ambulance arrived. they came downstairs and statutes saying that she needed reanimation. minutes after, she regained pulse.

it seems she took pills, we don‚Äôt know how much and since how long.

they took her out of the house the ambulance runed away with her. that was at around 7:40 pm. we haven‚Äôt heard anything yet. (it‚Äôs 10:47 pm we i am)


this is the first time i experience this kind of situation and my head is spinning. hearing the mom screaming, watching her family rushing in, the police, the ambulance coming in and taking her out‚Ä¶ but what striked me the most was watching her baby in the arms of her husband and thinking: how could you do that to him? (i don‚Äôt mean to judge) i felt so sad for that little boy‚Ä¶ as i said she appeared to be alive when they took her away, i hope she is. i hope all the family is okay. i don‚Äôt know what she was going through but i hope she recovers and get to see her son and her husband.

if you are having thoughts or if you are in a bad place please seek help, please talk to somebody. there is people out there that loves you, even if you feel that there isn‚Äôt i can guarantee you that somewhere out there there is somebody that loves you. things will get worse before they start to get better, so please keep fighting, you‚Äôre gonna make it , you‚Äôre gonna pull through it, you‚Äôre gonna be okay, everything is gonna be okay.

"I feel like I‚Äôm constantly doing what I feel like a normal human should be doing. I consume so much social media and watch so much tv that idk what‚Äôs real and what‚Äôs a performance anymore. What is performative friendship and what‚Äôs real anyway? I feel truly like it‚Äôs all a performance like I genuinely feel like a character in a show trying to keep everyone entertained. I know I should have friends and a partner and I should keep trying to be presentable but everything just feels like this huge chore and I‚Äôm constantly trying to pretend it isn‚Äôt. I think art and life is one and the same because some people find joy in the act while for others the artificial nature of it makes it unenjoyable. I don‚Äôt have fun pretending people‚Äôs up and down behavior is amusing and generally people are more aggravating than anything. I find people exhausting because of how unpredictable they are. I can‚Äôt just be me because of course I get what it‚Äôs like on the receiving end and for that reason alone I must be kind.

I must constantly set aside my own needs and respond to people even though I find it utterly boring. I think to have any sort of amusement in life you have to be somewhat selfish. The happiest people I met were complete assholes who put themselves above everything. An ex friend of mine would never consider suicide and had so much love for life she couldn‚Äôt have it in her to have empathy for someone who doesn‚Äôt. It must be easy for someone like her who forgives and forgets so easily and steps all over the things I enjoy. She showed little interest in what I enjoyed and had the nerve to say that I HAD THE POWER in the friendship. 

I had the power yet I constantly bent myself backwards trying to be a good friend showing interest in what she liked yet she treated me like a complete ghost and I was just another person for her to collect. This is how optimistic people are, they think miserable people are a burden and the mere presence of unhappiness is a threat on their wellbeing. Me just being my true authentic self is a threat on people and they feel uncomfortable. They think I‚Äôm stupid for caring about the wellness of human beings and society. They think I‚Äôm weak for watching the news and being personally emotionally affected by things. Feeling sadness at the plight of others is seen as a weakness. I genuinely can‚Äôt live in a world where everyone is trying to get ahead by acting on their own selfish needs.

True empathy is extremely hard to come by and people who seemed like they had good intentions hurt me. They still act on their selfish desires and don‚Äôt care whether it‚Äôs what‚Äôs good or not. It‚Äôs like every waking moment I‚Äôm questioning everything I consume. The idea of being rich is enticing until I see how every rich person is out of touch to a certain degree. They try to be good people yet they participate in the exact thing that makes people hurt. You can‚Äôt exactly bend yourself for other‚Äôs needs but at the same time these people should quit pretending to be altruistic when in actuality they‚Äôre apart of the same competitive system as the rest of us. 

A true selfless act would be not participating in most things. It seems like no matter what I do I‚Äôm inadvertently hurting someone. I think I should just take the burden away from everyone by ending it all. Being human is being selfish inherently. We can say we want a change as much as we want and it does seem like humanity swings towards goodness. However that could possibly take a long time and the more idiots I have to face unfortunately the more suicidal I become.",1

"(Throwaway acct) I (19F) don't think I can physically or mentally handle this anymore. Basically, I had been in an on and off abusive relationship for years. He SA'd me multiple times.

My family put lots of pressure on me to go through with adoption, because god-forbid there be a teen mother in the family (even tho there already was one, my aunt). I placed my only child for adoption one year ago. The mental pain only got worse. It is an open adoption, although the adoptive parents have become more distant. I used to get pictures every other day, now im even lucky to get them once a month. I have deleted all the pictures of my child off my phone, it is too painful for me. I avoid it at all costs.

My birthday happened this week, and it has to have been the worst birthday ever. I woke up crying, in a lot of physical pain and dizzy, my mom was drunk. I was holding back tears the whole day.

"I (23F-ish) can‚Äôt stop thinking about killing myself. I tend to end up imagining how or when I‚Äôll kill myself, and I keep imagining what or if I say anything to bother people before I do it. I have a handful of friends who I feel as though I have trapped in a bugs bunny-esque social contraption to stay out of obligation and I know my family despises me and how I rarely leave my room. Often, I crutch these ideas as though I‚Äôm telling my ‚Äúimaginary therapist‚Äù but lately that barrier has been withering away and it feels more solid. I refuse to tell people because of how they have reacted to less intense things I or other figures have said in the past.

I‚Äôve been thinking that I‚Äôm evil, unloveable, and repulsive. I know what my body looks like and I get the whole ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just not your type‚Äù but at the end of the day I hate how I am regardless of the state because I‚Äôm the one inside it. I‚Äôve never been desired and the idea that I could be is laughable and eldritch. I feel as though the only worth I have is through my job, but that the cost of me existing outweighs it, significantly. I feel evil for existing and not having died sooner.

For a while I thought I was fine, I was able to beat this shit back into the bay for a few years with it cropping up occasionally but I feel like I‚Äôve fallen into ‚Äúbad habits‚Äù. I want to lie down on the train tracks and get run over.

I hate this shit so much because I know that sometimes I feel better, less or even not suicidal. But the issue is that I really feel like a completely different person, and being that way I know logically that I have the same thoughts but they just don‚Äôt ‚Äúfeel‚Äù the same like I‚Äôm flipping between two side of a coin.

I don't feel self-righteous or justified in any way afterwards, though, the way people seem to talk about it. I feel exhausted and deeply embarrassed, because looking back, I can see how completely irrational I was being to the point that my own behavior doesn't seem to make sense at all. It just makes me want to crawl into a hole and disappear, because how the fuck could anyone tolerate that more than once? What makes a person like that worth the effort?

Everyone around me is trying their hardest, but my outbursts and meltdowns are constant, sometimes more than once a week, and none of the grounding techniques I learned in outpatient work very well.

I feel like a burden, persistently.

When I try to look up advice, information, or self-help, I'm just bombarded with horror stories about people's abusive relationships at the hand of someone with BPD, that people like me should simply be abandoned, how I'm doomed to suffer for the rest of my life, how I'll never be happy with anything and I simply cannot be fixed.

My therapist and my current psychiatrist tell me that what I have is actually CPTSD, and that BPD isn't a ""real"" diagnosis, and yet it's right there on my psych eval from my last psychiatrist, permanently affixed to my mental health record, and even they tell me that it's not something that'll ever be fixed, that I just have to learn to cope and manage it.

I'm sitting in a voice call right now feeling irritated by everyone speaking, wanting to lash out irrationally, but even if I leave it'll set people off, and that if I leave, I'm going to progressively cut myself off until someone comes to retrieve me. I can fucking hear it already, ""There she goes again, she's doing it again,"" I can hear the sighs and the exasperation, I can feel my best friend's blood pressure rising.

I just can't stand this anymore. I'm not happy. I'm never happy. I feel like a fucking curse on everyone in my life and I care too much about them to keep subjecting them to this bullshit. I can't even make new friends, I just drive them off or else they abandon me or lose interest, which is fair, given I'm not very interesting, so it's like there's just this slow trickle of everyone away from me, like I'm bleeding out, and I can't stand this persistent feeling of isolation and misery anymore.",1
"The revolver will be my escape device out of this miserable place. Sadly gonna have to wait like 4 years though; it‚Äôll be worth it. I‚Äôve almost come up with 100 reasons to commit suicide, if anyone wants to see them I‚Äôll gladly post the list when I‚Äôm finished.",1
"I am more depressed than I have been for a long time, although things are slowly improving. I am mentally exhausted and don't know what to do anymore.

"I‚Äôm using a throwaway because if anyone found out about this I would lose my career and it‚Äôs the only thing I have that I care about. 
I tried to kill myself when I was in college years ago and ended up in a hospital. I was medicated for a few years and when I was off meds I decided to try and actually do something to warrant my existence. 
I won‚Äôt give many details but I became a commissioned officer and went through a particularly selective process for the specific job in the military that I have and I thought being a leader and having people to look after and make better would help me get better but it hasn‚Äôt.

All of my friends have girlfriends, fiances, families that love them and things like that and I thought maybe those things would come by being successful and in shape and all that but it hasn‚Äôt and I just have nothing but my work. 
I love the men that I lead and would do anything for them and I just don‚Äôt want to live anymore but I owe it to them to live and I just wish I could die and they would be okay. 
My friend with a fiance and loving family and friends saw how I interact with my platoon and said he was depressed because he doesn‚Äôt get that sort of relationship from his job. I take a ton of pride in being a leader that has reliably led my boys through hardships and the happiest I am is when they show and say that they value me, but I have nothing outside of work. I‚Äôm not loved and nobody actually wants me. I‚Äôm a weird guy who‚Äôs going to die alone and I drink every night so I‚Äôm too drunk to drive off and shoot myself somewhere and I don‚Äôt want to leave the mess of my body in the house I share with a roommate. I‚Äôm a successful, in shape, educated person and I‚Äôm always the one rejected even by people who have nothing to offer but just paying attention to me. If anyone knew I want to kill myself I would lose my command and those boys are the only thing I actually care about in this life and then I‚Äôd have no choice.

I told myself for years that leading and taking care of people would make things better and I wouldn‚Äôt want to die but I‚Äôve been here for months now and I plan out times where I can shoot myself every night I come home.",1
I know it will be terrible for them either way. But I need advice on how to make it a little better. Maybe isolating myself first? Or if theres a way I could die and have them not find out that would help me a lot. I just don‚Äôt want to hurt them but I also have lived out all I can stand. I think generally I made things harder for them and for my friends. I don‚Äôt want consolation. Nothing could convince me otherwise. If this isn‚Äôt the place to get that advice can you just comment a link of where to go? ,1

"Honestly, I'm really tired. For the last months I've barely even stepped out of my room, I have been eating like shit, and have literally no one to talk to about how I feel or atleast no one who cares. 
I've been having suicidal thoughts for a really long time, and always been telling my self, ""let's just see what happens tomorrow, maybe things may look like they are about to get better"" but I'm done now, absolutely no one, of the few people in my life, will care whatsoever, and have no motivation of getting better or helping myself. 
I've always hated myself, and in someway is why I wanna kill myself, every single fucking day I look at a mirror just disgusted by the horrible person I am. 
I'm a terrible human being and I should die alone, with no to care about me. ",1
"Not trying to open this up for activism. Death and suicide has just been very top of mind for the past month and I ask myself that question in the title a lot.


I guess I'm just really stuck on the meaninglessness of life. I don't believe in any higher powers and the reasons to keep going don't really make sense to me. Philosophical arguments like Camus were more along the line of creating my own reason to live but I feel like I'm in a place right now where that just doesn't make sense to me. Like why create a meaning for myself when my own opinions keep changing and evolving. It feels like I don't have a strong foundation. 

Life just feels like it isn't worth the trouble. I don't dislike my life but I do feel like I'm slowly dying or being poisoned by the life I do lead. I'm not saying my life is bad, I just don't see the reason for keeping going. My mental health is bad enough that I really just think I shouldn't exist and I've felt some version of this for years.

i wish i had been born a boy ,1
"I am a software developer and like many of us I got laid off 4 months ago. To explain my story from the top college was a depressing time for me, I did whatever I could to graduate without debt, the community college route, stayed home all 4 years but shit went sideways with a transfer to the college at the 2 year mark of my journey I wanted not working out and it led to a suicide attempt which landed me in the hospital, at my parents insistence even though I wanted time to rest, they wanted me to apply wherever I can and get going with a transfer to graduate within the normal 4 year timeframe. I didn't have a choice so within a day I got back from the hospital I started applying and got into a school, so I did, still made the call to stay home to save money due to the pandemic. I still really had a tough time working through my mental shit with therapy and balancing that with school, I barely scraped by with my grades, my professors there as a silver lining had connections to an extremely prestigious institution for computer science which I ended up getting an internship through that and working with them. I barely had a social life unless friends came back from their college. Despite everything, inevitably I graduated in 2022 within the 4 years without debt like my parents wanted and I got a 3 job offers from reputable companies within 3 months of searching.

When I accepted the job out of the 3, I was finally happy, it was fully remote, great benefits, and solid WLB. I was off to a strong start, and it felt great. I got along with my coworkers and managers. I moved out and lived on my own on the first time, could buy all the stuff that I wanted. I thought for the first time I made it, and I could start living my life. I got showered praise from manager for around 7-8 months, and he reassured that I am doing great. My director after I met him in person for my first business trip really liked me and even offered me to help him with a project he was overseeing from the ground up for the company. He even messaged me personally that I was getting a substantial raise without me even asking which was based on performance. A couple weeks later I got the raise however, there was another lead person I answered to on the technical side of the main stack I worked on and unfortunately with it being my first job I was still learning the ropes and I was beyond the 6-month mark (8 months) and during the code review I asked an extremely stupid coding question which I am embarrassed to repeat. He didn't say anything to me that meeting, and when I had my 1-1 with my direct report a couple days later, I was told by him that my tech lead said ""he doubted my competency to do my job"" with a meeting that included all the managers, tech leads, and director. So eventually it became this cycle of him complaining to my direct report/management first, so it was always a 2v1 against me and my direct conversation with him happened after the fact. In between this my direct manager said everything was going fine and even got constant praise from my director, I tried my best to improve wherever I can but it made things confusing on how I was doing. Eventually we had this meeting before Christmas where all the teams got together within our division and the leads of each stack talked about, we did. The tech lead proceeded to credit everyone in the summit for their specific contributions in the stack and left me out, not even crediting for helping out with a project someone else was working on which he brought up.

That led into my next meeting where due to circumstances my original direct report had have an extended leave transferred his responsibilities to a different manager and proceeded to put me on a PiP and my tech lead would be involved. My manager was put on one before and said I can get through it. At this point I wanted to keep my job because of the market and despite everything that happened I wanted to stay here and have a long-term career. Long story short it was grueling, day in day out I had to attend every meeting in our division, work long hours, constantly felt like my tech lead made jabs at me during code reviews in front of everyone even once telling me in front of my entire team when I built a design document which said he was right at a high level when I asked him in a dm the day before, then in the code review telling me it was wrong and told me that ""I was just guessing"" in front of everyone.

Eventually the dreaded message came to meet my director for a 1-1 in a Teams meeting a couple weeks before my PiP ended, and I got the news I was laid off with a bunch of other employees. It was probably due to what happened with my performance review last year and despite that in the meeting my director said he can be a reference and he got everyone else he could on the team to give me assistance with finding a new job through endorsements and recommendations. Didn't get a single message from my original direct report and the last message I got from my tech lead as the team immediately received the news of the layoff was a notification that he removed me from the code review teams meetings despite my corporate account being deleted within the hour.

I am now 3 months in the job search, and I haven't landed a single interview from any application I submitted. I am getting to the point now where I have to force myself to apply my jobs and applying to less and less each day. Despite tuning my LinkedIn, getting recommendations from several colleagues ranging from my director, other tech leads, managers and developers who liked me at my last job and getting my resume reviewed by multiple people even an ex-FAANG recruiter who said it's in a good spot. Tried everything from tuning my resume for each position, changing the format, unique cover letters, to even shotgunning applications nothing I send is sticking. I have 3 months of unemployment left and another year of savings after that so I can last till my apartment lease ends. But now I am getting pressured by my parents to take the first offer since I have only gotten interviews from recruiters calling me for bottom of the barrel contract jobs. I know they are probably right but I just don't know how I will have the energy to job search when managing another job.

I am starting to give up on life and just wondering what the point of it all is. The job was the only thing I had in college that proved everything I did and sacrificed was worth it; I am close to my mid 20's I realized I missed out on huge amount of social opportunities and long-lasting friends or relationships in college and I am not unemployed which makes it even worse. I still have friend groups in my childhood I am still very close with but it's hard to feel everyone is passing you by while you struggle and get lectured on what to do. I just feel an extreme amount of jealousy towards everyone I know since they have their jobs still and are advancing professionally and socially and seeing many of my old colleagues getting promotions on LinkedIn. Recently, I sometimes feel that I should have ended my life that day in 2020 because I feel like either way, I fail one way or the other, I have been seeing a therapist and while it has been helping idk if it's enough. I know people tell me to just pick yourself up and keep trying but I am tired of everything and life.",1

"I'm 22(M), and I'm in my final year in some university in Nigeria. Recently, I've been having some thoughts of ending my life. It's crazy, because this is the first time I'm saying this out loud lol. I guess I have never said it out loud because I wish it wasn't true, plus I think the reason why I'm having these thoughts is pretty much stupid in the grand scheme of things. It may sound dumb, but the reason I've been having these thoughts is because I may end up not graduating this year, and my energy for school is nonexistent. I never really liked school from day one. And I live in a society that bases your worth majorly on your academic achievements and then financial status. The moment I stepped into this university, I have been dreaming about leaving or dropping out. I study Engineering, and the programme typically spans 5 years, and I always thought that before the 5 years would be up, I'd hit jackpot in my career as a frontend developer and drop out.
I think the major reason why not graduating this year and having an extra year is such a big deal is because of the pressures I experience. Growing up, I had always been the intelligent one and people tend to have high expectations of me because they regard me as intelligent, and those expectations typically involves doing well in the university. But, I just... can't. I hate this school. I don't like being around these people. Every morning I wake up here, it always feels like I'm being strangled. I hate going to classes, I hate writing exams, I hate all of it. And I've never been open about this because I'm afraid of judgement.  Heck, even as I type this I'm judging myself. But feeling this way about school, and then having to stay an extra year?! It feels impossible. I don't think I can do it. And then opening up to my parents and siblings about my academic failures feels like a hurdle that I cannot possibly cross. Especially my parents. Their expectations of me are too high, and they care about me a lot, and I would hate to disappoint them. My parents are not the progressive sort at all. I know for a fact that they won't take it well. They definitely won't. And I'd hate to make them sad, but I can't avoid it at this point. Everything just feels overwhelming right now. Right now, it's hard to imagine myself living past the next few months. My mental health is on thin ice, and I can't really talk to anyone about this because I'm afraid of being judged by them. I just wished I didn't care or gave a fuck about any of it, but I do, and it's eating away at me everyday. Plus I have so much school work to do, but I haven't even been able to leave my room lol. I feel like a failure, and I feel like I have disappointed a lot of people who had any sort of expectations of me. It's difficult imagining a life past all of this, but I hope it happens. I love my family, and I wouldn't want to make them sad or disappointed because of me.",1

"The last couple years have been really difficult. I have lost a lot. A couple of the main things are my mom and my home. I am currently in a homeless shelter for the last year and now they are pushing me out the door. The other week when they gave me a date, July 26th, I flipped out. 

I have a job but not enough income to afford to pay for an apartment. I have had epilepsy my entire life so it's has been difficult keeping a job and getting along with people. I made a decision about 20 years ago that if my mom passed away first and I ended up on the streets I wouldn't go on living. I mean there is no point. Before the Covid started I lost my job because of my seizures, my cat passed away, my friend passed away, had to sell my car, my mom passed away and now am homeless. There is more but that's the main things. There has been so much in my life that I have thought about suicide before. That cat I mentioned was a stray cat that I started to care for and I never really liked cats. She helped me through so many hard times in my life. I believe she was sent by God to help me through the bad days. It's just like everything worth living for is gone.

I really don't know exactly what I will do if they kick me out but I am sure it won't be good. I will be back to where I was a little over a year ago or be seeing my mom in Paradise. ",1

And the funny thing is I‚Äôm so relieved. Finally, I won‚Äôt have to be tortured anymore. I‚Äôm tearing up for the first time in a long time, and it‚Äôs tears of relief. I honestly can‚Äôt wait, I‚Äôd do it tonight if I didn‚Äôt have responsibilities to sort out first.",1

"
Warning: this post includes loads of triggers, please don‚Äôt read if it‚Äôll hurt you. 
I apologise in advance; it‚Äôs quite long I thought I should provide context.!

So I (27F), just been told I‚Äôm the toxic one in my family. My little brother (19M) got tired of my shit and called me on it. I didn‚Äôt know. It was 3h ago, I‚Äôm having a breakdown/existential crisis/ realisation overload. 
It‚Äôs horrible. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I called the suicide helpline. 
For a bit of context: I have several chronic illnesses, all of them quite painful, for the past 7 years. Monthly trips to the A&amp;E, daily hormones/painkillers/antidepressants, weekly appointments to Specialists Dr. It‚Äôs quite hard because I tried going to University and had to stop because of the pain, tried working and pain stopped me again , I can‚Äôt even be a reliable volunteer. I used to play the cello, and do ballet, and paint and draw, and read a lot, but the pain shakes and the medication makes it too hard now ( kids‚ÄôPaint by number are too hard for me). 
On top of those chronic illnesses; I have to battle PTSD for multiple rapes, a psychologically abusive ex, medical malpractices, absent father, school bullying ( from preK to A levels), being sterile and daily pain. 
Not a surprise if I tell you I am depressed. 
And I thought the best thing to do was to just deal with all of that myself, to prove them I was independent and strong. Not to burden them because they already had their problems to deal with. 
But no. My brother in law gifted my sister a ‚Äúhow to deal with narcissists‚Äù book and I just realised it was about me. 
I had to move in with my mom ( parents going through a separation right now), because I wasn‚Äôt able to take care of myself on a daily basis (like food and showers and cleaning and groceries ect were too much). 
And I‚Äôve been treating her like shit. I would be on the streets without her. 
And I thought I had the behaviour that conveyed my gratitude. That‚Äôs the worse part, it wasn‚Äôt on purpose. The pain gave me tunnel vision and I was so focused on one meal at a time, one step at a time.
They know me so badly they gifted me shelves for my birthday, and did party food ( crisps and mini toasts), because they don‚Äôt know my favourite foods. 
I thought I was masking my daily bad moods ( very hard to be happy when your one and unique thought is PAIN), but they were suffering. 
I treated my mum like a slave, I didn‚Äôt even say good mornings or thanks to all the chores she did for me. 
I knew I did something bad because she‚Äôs been retreating herself from me, leaving me to deal alone with my mess. 
3 days ago I had a flare up so bad I was immobilised and crying /yelling in pain for several hours. The neighbours got worried and called the cops and ambulance. They took me to the hospital and kept me for 3days to ran tests and control the pain. Apparently they came ( mum and brother)to my room and knocked to check up on me and I didn‚Äôt hear them. Now, my mum is angry at me because she was ashamed of having to deal with the cops.
A part of me is tired to be made the bad guy every time. If I go to my room to deal with my pain ( like at Christmas), I‚Äôm sulking and ignoring everyone. My mum says ¬´¬†to not check for non intentional consequences/ accidents of your actions, is doing it on purpose¬†¬ª, basically if you cared you would have thought ahead if it would hurt anyone. So for her, all my hurting behaviour is on purpose. 
They always jump to the worst conclusion; I‚Äôm not in terrible pain for days; I‚Äôm just being moody and not replying to their texts. 
They don‚Äôt understand that I have nothing happening in my life for the past years except my illnesses. I can‚Äôt out and I‚Äôm losing a lot of my friends ( not on bad terms but it hurts to reply to every ‚Äúhow are you?‚Äù With ‚Äúbad‚Äù). 
And I love my family so much, they‚Äôre the most important persons to me, the closests. But I just learnt that it was only one way. I was close to them but they didn‚Äôt know me. 
You know what the worse is? I don‚Äôt remember all that bad behaviour, I zone out/dissociate a lot. Apparently I yell; I don‚Äôt remember ever having an argument with my little brother but he just told me it happened several times last summer. I was very mean with all of them, yelled at them and said horrible things ( again I don‚Äôt remember).  So they cut me off for several months, September to Christmas. Then I did something wrong for my sister‚Äôs birthday apparently and was cut off again in February. My mother only invited me to live with her because she had to pay my rent ( moved in with her end of April). They stopped telling me when they cut me off because apparently I don‚Äôt change. 
So my question to you all; I want to explain to them that it‚Äôs the depression and ask them to give me another chance ( I‚Äôm getting myself into a psychiatric hospital by the end of the week). But a big part of me don‚Äôt want to hurt them, to guilt them into forgiveness. I realised how much pain and hurt I caused, and it would be so much better for them if I got out of their life. 
It‚Äôs so hard to keep on living every day when you are in non stop pain ( it will be for life, there is no cure, but it won‚Äôt kill me so not a Medical research‚Äôs priority). I am useless, I can‚Äôt provide anything to society, I can‚Äôt work, I can‚Äôt have kids, I will be someone‚Äôs burden all my life. I am suicidal, but the only thing that kept me going was them. I couldn‚Äôt do it because it would hurt them. But I already hurt them alive, how much worse can dying really be ? Im seriously thinking of going to Switzerland for the assisted suicide charities, I don‚Äôt want one of them to find me dead and traumatise/hurt them even dead. 
Opened to all suggestions and advice and help, 
Thank you in advance for reading all this. ",1

"I was recently diagnosed with BPD, and have learned the concept of ‚Äúquiet BPD‚Äù. It made me think of quiet suicide. I have so much inner turmoil. So much mental abuse from myself, it‚Äôs exhausting and non-stop. So few know, those that do are doubtful I feel the way I do.

I let her know I would do this and she said it was okay with a sad face emoji. I knew this meant she wasn‚Äôt okay with it and she stopped responding to me all together. She tells me to be the bigger person in the relationship and at that moment all I could think about was how to make her feel better. I quickly got myself together for her sake and came back, she kept telling me why I came back and I told her it was because I was worried for her. Eventually she asked me why, I told her I was feeling suicidal again. She didn‚Äôt say anything to comfort me, or atleast I didn‚Äôt feel comforted. Then she went on to tell me how I made her mad and how I make her feel worthless because I don‚Äôt do enough for her. I just feel so unseen and honestly writing all this out makes me feel so selfish. 

My suicidal tendencies aren‚Äôt because of her or this, this definitely feeds onto it though. 

Just now she called me asking me where I put something she bought as a gift, I told her I didn‚Äôt know and after her searching everywhere she believes I left it in her old house. I told her to contact someone there to be given the chance to find it but she completely shuts me down. I offer to do it for her and she says it‚Äôs useless. I offer to pay for it and tells me I‚Äôm broke and she doesn‚Äôt want my money. 

I‚Äôm boarding a plane right now, she knows it, but she never told me to have a safe flight or anything like that. She got mad at me yesterday because I didn‚Äôt commute to her house one final time (I went to her house two days ago and woke up at 7:30 to commute back to something I needed to go to.) i feel like nothing I do right is ever considered. 

 
I just want to disappear or die gruesomely or something so my parent don‚Äôt have to witness me killing myself. I honestly would appreciate someone to talk to, I feel so alone. Or if you think I‚Äôm the one in the wrong tell me so I can realize it and I can change it. Thank you",1

"ive been struggling with suicidal ideation and behaviors for a long time now, my first attempt was when i was 15 years old and i took a bottle of clonidine, i attempted 4 times after but all times i never really wanted to die i was just severely emotionally unstable. now it isnt like that, now its a hopeless feeling and consistent disappointment within myself and with others. i dont like anything about myself, i hate my appearance, i hate my personality, i hate my humor, im painfully self aware and i can never sit in my own happiness without knowing its temporary. the only thing keeping me here is the reaction from loved ones, i dont have a support system but i have a family and a boyfriend and a few close friends. i reach out to people, i started publicly posting about how lonely i am and it seems everyone is just desensitized to my depressed bullshit. i always feel like im trauma dumping or manipulating the people i express these thoughts to so i just sit with them. i just feel like a fucking loser whos bound to be unhappy no matter what.

"I feel like this is probably just as much a release and hopefully helps me let out a lot of tension I have inside me. 

I have a history of suicide, I tried when I was 14 and failed (which is quite ironic because I was doing it because I felt like a failure). I‚Äôm 26 now and the feelings have got stronger and stronger day by day. 

It‚Äôs hard to explain because on paper I‚Äôm very fortunate. I‚Äôve got a good job, I‚Äôve got mostly a good lifestyle and I live one of the best cities in the world. Butttt.. I hate myself, I hate everything about myself outside of the situation I‚Äôm in. 

I hate my skin colour, it makes me feel like an outsider in my own country, with my own friends. I‚Äôve been brought up in a society that I believe thinks being white is better and that‚Äôs more so drilled into me and my thinking. So many people saying oh you aren‚Äôt British, no no where are you really from. 

My dad left my family when I was young. Which I think is pretty common but it‚Äôs the lack of effort he tried with me. His only communications with me, if we can even classify it as that, was to goad my mother. 

My last girlfriend told me she doesn‚Äôt love me and felt like she never could. That shit cut me so deep, I felt unlovable and even when asking to explain it she said she didn‚Äôt know, but I was so nice she wanted to try.

My mum has always put the pressure on me to perform and whilst that has meant I‚Äôve achieved a lot of academic success. I will always look for the negative in myself or the situation because that‚Äôs how it‚Äôs always been for me. My mum would always point out my weak points to prove. 

I can pinpoint all the things that I don‚Äôt like about myself and where they stem from, and yes I‚Äôve tried therapy, I‚Äôve tried medication too. They just don‚Äôt seem to subdue or get better. ",1

I quit using cannabis a week ago. I work in a call center which is stressful, but even more so whenever I'm going through something. I keep wanting to cut my wrists just to feel a pain I can control. I want to shave all of my hair out, it's the longest it's ever been and I feel more feminine than I ever did. 
I feel like a failure to my parents. I don't blame my s.o for wanting someone else maybe. He says he doesn't but the things he says tells me otherwise. My work would be better off without me too.

We live in such a stupid and cruel world. Why? Why are things so fucking bad? Why can't I live in a just and hopeful world? The world I live in is just so awful that I don't want to be around anymore. This might be one of the biggest reasons I'm suicidal. ,1

The literal only thing that keeps me here is my cats because who's gonna explain to them I'm gone forever? They'll think I hate them and abandoned them.

"I (18 AMAB) have been very depressed over my gender dysphoria for a long time, and have been diagnosed with clinical anxiety and depression for longer.

My family has no interest in helping or supporting me with wanting to be female. Any time I try to talk about it, I get shot down, told it's just a phase, or anything else except some empathy. I've been explicitely told I'm not allowed to ""Walk around here (home) thinking I'm a girl.""

Worse, my dad recently expressed that he thinks that project 2025 is a good thing and trump is a patriot. What's so worrying this that we don't even live on that continent. It just tells me that he's so conservative he's transcended nationality to support bigotry.

I hate looking in the mirror. Showering is agony. Even masturbating just feels bad, because I hate my genitals.

I have considered genital self mutilation, anything to get rid of it. But I'm afraid I'll be confronted by my family in a less than comfortable manner.

If I just killed myself, I wouldn't have to deal with any consequences, and could end a horrible existence stuck in someone else's body. My ideal plan would be asphyxiating myself with Nitrogen since it should be painless. Otherwise hanging is an easily accessible option",1

"TW for suicide (duh) and self-harm.

Frankly, I don't want to die at this moment. Disappearing sounds amazing, but me comitting suicide would make my mom very sad and I don't want to put her through that. 

It's really weird and stupid, but for years and years I've just had intense fantasies of getting really hurt and being hospitalized. I have no idea why, as I know this wouldn't fix anything, and probably just make me feel worse. But Gods, I just want someone to actively care for me and see how miserable I am.

Yesterday evening I told myself, tomorrow would be the day. This morning I was supposed to slit my wrists. Not sure what the plan was after that. Either call the emergency number myself or have my mom help. 

Well, I did it, kinda. Not enough to seriously hurt me though. 

I just can't get it out of my head, and everyday I'm in a constant debate whether I should do it or not. 

What I absolutely do not want though, is to get the rest of my family involved in this, and Gods those social workers. No offense, they're just doing their jobs, but I seriously cannot deal with those people anymore and I can already imagine the conversations. Also a mental hospital sounds absolutely miserable. 

Then, make it look like an accident? Be hit by a car? I frequently go out, it wouldn't be strange for me to wound up in an accident at all. But that'd hurt damn bad, and the chance of me dying would be bigger.

These thoughts are horrible and I've had them for so long, but never have I been so close to actually following them as I am now. I just *cannot* live like this anymore. I am so goddamn miserable everyday and no one can do anything about it.

So much therapy, so much different medication, so much ""how does that make you feel?"", so much being forced to look into my future when I don't see anything there, and *none* of it has helped in the slighest. I'm done, I need a break. 

I can't talk about this with my mom, it'd make her so concerned and she already has too much stuff going on, in general I just cannot seem to talk about anything like this face to face with someone, and I'd be scared a therapist would put me in a mental hospital. And frankly, 'talking about it' has just never helped for me.

Thanks for listening, sorry to be a bummer.",1
So my dad threatened to kill himself a few weeks ago with a knife and got hospitalized then lied his way out a few weeks later and a few days ago used all of his money he had to buy a gun. My parents are getting divorced cause he's an asshole and he's been really mad about that and I'm worried he's gonna try to hurt my mom or other family members then himself or just himself but either way he's gonna hurt someone. But idk if I should take the gun cause if I do he'll be absolutely pissed and will probably try to hurt me in some way but I care way more about the rest of my family so I think I might just take it from him so he can't hurt himself or anyone else. But idk what should I do??,1
"I don't want to kill myself but I am starting to feel convinced that death is the only way to stop the pain. I've been dealing passive suicidal ideation most of my life due to mental illness, and it has recently switched into being more active ideation because I've been starting to think about actual plans on doing it.

I've tried reaching out to people I consider to be my friends but it's like they all take a step back whenever I'm feeling more depressed instead of helping me and I don't know how to deal with thst. It sucks because it more or less confirms how I feel like no one really cares about me and that I really am as alone as I feel.

I can't afford to get into treatment even though being in and out of it various times throughout my life hasn't seemed to help since I always find myself right back to feeling like killing myself is a reasonable option.

It doesn't seem to matter what kind of activity I try to distract myself, suicide is always somewhere in the back of my mind. What can I do to truly get these dangerous thoughts out of my head?",1

Im 17f, and a military brat to start this off. Ever since I was a little kid, I‚Äôve dealt with major rage issues, I‚Äôve slammed and broken iPads, computers, household items, punched walls, etc you get the point. This, mixed with a dad with PTSD (and probably bipolar) and a sister with audhd made home hell. It felt like constantly walking on eggshells.

For a while in my life, the mix of my dad being a chronic asshole and my mom just trying to enjoy her life lead to lots of fighting. A lot. There were months where there would be screaming matches every day between parents, where computer mice were being thrown through walls from across the house (impressive throw though) or smaller things broken. This usually ended with a ‚Äúwe‚Äôre getting a divorce‚Äù (spoiler, it never happened), being threatened hundreds of times. Whenever I talked to my sister, it turned into a game of rules, what can I say not to peeve her, what can I listen to on my phone, what can I do in her presence to not bother her, which a lot of times ended up happening anyways. When we were kids, whenever we argued we were told to just shut up, and we‚Äôve grown up hearing yelling, so when we disagree nowadays we do just that. It turns into a game of who can hurt the other more. This makes my relationship with her very rocky, we‚Äôll go from pissed to happy to pissed again, to once again happy within the same day, every day.

When I was a kid, things started popping up early, me scratching myself at 6-7, moving onto poking myself with needles when I was 8-9. This only got worse as I went to blades. My parents swear it‚Äôs a teenage thing, but because of the ages mentioned I don‚Äôt think it is. I‚Äôve always felt this way. A mix of how easily I flip out now, and how I treat myself and others, my family sometimes treats me like I‚Äôm just crazy, which pisses me off more and makes me start insulting them. I know part of it is pent up anger, but I‚Äôm starting to think they‚Äôre right. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me.

I cannot get myself to get up and go to school anymore, I‚Äôll miss 70+ days a year even though my school is only half the average school day. 4 hours. I cannot handle 4 hours of school. In turn, my dad yells. I cannot keep friends, I go through a phase where I‚Äôm obsessed with one friend, then I ghost everyone else and sometimes even said friend I‚Äôm fixated on in the moment, simply as a ‚Äúdo they care‚Äù, and even if they do message me I continue doing so. This makes friendships hard, I‚Äôm constantly finding a new friend every few months, even though I have others messaging me asking to hang out. I scream at my family, I ghost my friends, I cannot keep my room cleaned to save my life, ive been pushing for a psychiatrist for years because of my doctor suggesting potential adhd, and a mix of my parents not wanting to accept both of their children can have issues and psychiatrists full on ignoring us because the area we live in is godawful when it comes to mental health is making it impossible. I‚Äôve tried anti depressants, and it hasn‚Äôt worked much, and I don‚Äôt benefit those around me. 

As a kid I was an edgelord, and I still am I guess, when I was 7-8 I watched gore, I won‚Äôt say the website but it was a very well known site. It was a mix of morbid curiosity and outlet, maybe I was partly trying to understand my dad at the time with his combat related ptsd, why he was so mean. I used to flex this to my friends, describe all the gnarly details as if it was something to show off, then I‚Äôd go home and watch that same thing. I know now how cringey that was. The issue is is that habit stuck, I still find myself visiting those sites, and doing mass research into any crime that sounded interesting to read. I know it‚Äôs cringey. Although, suicide videos always stuck out to me since I was a kid, it always being an escape in the back of my mind because of it.

Now I‚Äôm here, I just got done being left on hold for over an hour while trying to get ahold of a psychiatrist again, I‚Äôve been hospitalized for attempts before, you‚Äôd think they‚Äôd care more but it‚Äôs been years of this. Years of being given referrals to clinics that don‚Äôt take my families insurance or just flat out ignore us. There is nothing I can do anymore. I feel so done with it all. No one‚Äôs taking new patients. I‚Äôm sick of screaming at my family, I‚Äôm sick of making my friends feel like shit because I can‚Äôt message back, I‚Äôm sick of feeling my heart get torn in two every time I get a message telling me that a friend is done with me, and I‚Äôm sick of being forced through these overwhelmingly strong emotions with nothing helping.

This is probably very poorly written but I do not care, i feel like a broken record and I don‚Äôt think I want to continue ts. I cannot believe how much the mental health system has failed me, I tried getting help, and got ignored. They couldn‚Äôt care less about me and I‚Äôm done giving a shit in a life where no one else does

"This post will be long because there is so much that is on my mind right now. Everything that is making me make plans to write suicide notes to my family and ending it are things completely out of my control. Here is some context: 

*  I live in the U.S. I am a young, disabled, Black college student. I live in a red state.
* I am nonbinary and AFAB.
* I do not have the money nor the means to leave the state or country before the election.

I know that a Trump presidency is inevitable. I feel like I will be hurt and abused by fascists. I feel like we are repeating history with Weimar Germany. Nobody in my family are really taking it seriously, believing that Biden will somehow pull through. I don't have faith in the two-party electoral system. I know Trump's base are more confident and rampant due to the attempted you-know-what. People have said this will earn him sympathy votes and that it is over. People constantly say stuff like ""We are cooked."" Other people say, ""Get to know your neighbors and join local community!"" but fascism is fascism. We live in an interconnected age where information is readily apparent and our digital footprints are at the fingertips of authorities. Maybe joining your local community was a viable option to those who stood up against fascist forces in the past, but now, we have better technology, better tracking, and more. Local community can't fix this. I can't fix this. There is nothing I can do but wait for the inevitable fascist to come to my house, abuse me, and end me. So I feel, why not end it myself? I know my family will miss me and it pains me and makes me cry every time I think of their tears. It would be devastating for them, but honestly with the way things are going, they will join me if a white supremacist fascist theocracy takes hold. I tell myself, ""Maybe the physical world is not meant for me, and there is some afterlife that I can enjoy instead. If I stop seeing death as the end, it will be easier. After all, my death ultimately won't change anything and billions of humans have died. What makes me special?"" I don't know. I have no hope. People say they live out of spite. I cannot do it. I want something to look forward to. I'm a planner. I can't go on without structure and reassurance and the ugly foundation of U.S. bigotry is giving me more reassurance that there is no hope. The Earth is dying too. I can only wish that those who wanted fascism but who are not rich and powerful enough to be sheltered from climate fallout and fascist in-fighting see the errors of their ways and foolishness of their actions, as fascism and capitalism are unsustainable. I don't know. I need hope. I don't want to die. But I see nothing but darkness. ",1

I just remembered something that happened when I was about 13 years old and it‚Äôs stressing me out. I think I walked in on my little sister (who would‚Äôve been about 11 at the time) masturbating to a picture of out step - nephew who would‚Äôve been a toddler then. Or I just saw the photo of him on my sister‚Äôs phone, there was no nudity in the pic or anything explicitly sexual, it just looked like my sister found a regular photo of him and zoomed in on his butt and screenshotted it. I don‚Äôt really remember this and I don‚Äôt know for sure if it was him but I do remember finding other pictures on her phone of similar things that she found on google but they were adults. I told her and our youngest brother about these other photos and she said she just thought they were funny or something (I think) and I thought it was funny too. But I sometimes sort of remember walking in on her masturbating to one of the photos but I honestly can‚Äôt remember any of this clearly and it‚Äôs stressing me out so much. 

I‚Äôm 17 and she‚Äôs 16 now and she‚Äôs never really expressed attraction to children, she did say sort of recently that Sheldon from young Sheldon was cute but not in like a weird way. But what if she did actually have a picture of our step - nephew and she had it for sexual reasons? What am I supposed to do? I remember worrying about this a little while back but I stopped for some reason, I think I stopped worrying about it because I couldn‚Äôt remember how old the child looked in the picture and thought it was someone close to her age at the time (which it still might be because I can‚Äôt remember). If that did actually happen, I don‚Äôt think I could bring myself to tell my mom and I don‚Äôt know if she‚Äôd actually do something about it anyway. I‚Äôve told her that me and my sibling are likely struggling with mental health issues before and she just ignored it. 

Everything about my family causes me stress. I wish I could kill myself but that‚Äôs just not an option for me right now. I hate this. ",1
"I want it to be over. I was married with a house and two cats and i knew if i killed myself then it would have ruined their life. I told them i wanted to get divorced, they took the cats and moved in with their family. Last thing I‚Äôm waiting for is the house. Which is in like two weeks. 

Then I can take all my stuff to goodwill or throw it away. Then I can write a letter explaining myself. Explaining that living is too much and i‚Äôve literally spent half my life wanting to die.

Then I can be free to kill myself finally. I picked a method, just need to work out the details.

 Its harder every day, even though I‚Äôve been trying to find reasons to stay, new fantasies of a future where things work out for me. I look for a path to reach those fantasies and always find a dead-end. 

I can‚Äôt put effort into anything anymore, and anything I put effort into is useless. ",1
"the only choice of stopping this is to  commit suicide. I still maybe here, breathing but sooner or even in the near future, I will still kill myself. I can't live like this, these pain, scars, traumas i can't live with this. ",1

"My mental health has been declining for the past two years. I've sought out therapy and medication, but I've reached the conclusion that it doesn't work for me. A few years ago I tried Wellbutrin, and it did absolutely nothing for me. I've moved on to Sertraline and Strattera. It's probably just the Strattera, but it destroyed my entire personality. I just stopped taking them a few weeks ago. Yeah, I know I needed to fucking taper them. I just couldn't stand feeling like a robot anymore.

I've talked to therapists and psychiatrists, but I lie to them about how bad things are. I've heard them sound disappointed when I tell them that I'm ""passively suicidal"". I cant tell them the truth. I don't see how institutionalizing me is going to make my life any better. I'll lose my job, then without a job, the bank will foreclose on my house. I'll jump off a fucking building if that happens.  
  
A few weeks ago, for the first time, I mentioned how I was feeling to my friend. You know what I was met with? Dismissal and judgement. 15 years of my god damned life spent building a friendship with her and she cant even be fucked to carry on a text conversation. The amount of hours I've talked about and remained actively engaged in her life, but she can't even conjure up two texts. I'm sure that once she decides to start talking to me again and when she pretends that I never said anything, I'll forgive her. It's because I'm a spineless piece of shit.

I pour everything I have into other people. No one pours anything back into me. No one has ever empathized with me. It doesn't matter the situation or circumstance, everything is always my fault. I'm a utility pole and once I'm out of utility to give, everyone will abandon me. Perhaps it's for the best. It will make ending things a whole lot easier. No one will miss me and it'll be easier knowing all vestiges of hope are gone.

I'm so fucking lonely. I'm almost 30. I've never had a meaningful girlfriend/partner. I always wanted someone to build a life with. Now, I'm almost """"complete"""". I have a career, house, car, hobbies, etc. However those things don't bring you happiness. I would absolutely throw it all away for a laptop and a dank efficiency apartment if I could just have someone in my life.

Oh yeah, did I mention that I also have type 1 diabetes? I eat some fucking crackers and my god damned blood sugar goes insane. Oh, you want to wake up and have a normal morning? Not for me! Let's go from 75 to 400 for no fucking reason! Then I can go to my endocrinologist to tell me how much of a fuckup I am and how fucked my future is. I mention this shit to my friends, but they don't care. Let's just go back to talking about their lives.

I think I'll OD on insulin. It's going to suck. I need to make sure I take enough to get the job done. I don't want to end up as a vegetable somewhere. It'll be nice becuase it could look like an accident which will make things easier for my parents and brother.",1

so now i'm just blasting music from my earbuds to feel better. i'm sad that i never find the good timing to commit.,1
"My life is doomed, I'm autistic and trans, I live in Italy where both of those things are... frowned upon, even my mom doesn't accept me, or maybe she does, I can't even tell. 

I want make videogames and stuff, so I will be poor in the future, who makes money of indie games. 

I'm a shut in socially awkward loser with no friends, and if someone wants to be my friend I assume they want to kidnap me and stuff...

I probably have a personality disorder which is incurable! 

My only reason to live is my cat and I have a longer life-span than her. 

What even is the point, the past traumatized me, the present is shit and the future is doomed, why should I keep on living? ",1
"Ive been toying with the idea of doing it in my head when something bad happens but it has gotten a little worse over the years. I feel like such a fraud bc i know deep down i cant do it i dont have the gall to. And it makes me so angry that the little comfort i feel when i think about it is not possibly attainable because in the end i cant do it i cant even properly harm myself. I just punch myself when im in the pit sometimes in a fit of desperation. I dont want anymore pain, im so tired of constant anxiety and panic. im an unlikeable negative person who does nothing but leech and has no future. Noone likes me and cant stand my existence. Even my parents dont like me and my sisters all pity my abilities. I always wish for me to hit a rockier bottom so i can finally reach the point of no return and do it. Im such a fucking poser and everytime i express these things no one fucking cares because they know im a coward. I hate the lingering fear i feel, i hate how i like some things in life and a part of me is still somehow hanging on. If i could, i would step on the fingers of that part and get it over with to feel some overdue relief. ",1
"To avoid being a fucking whiny brat. To avoid being stupid and killing myself for no reason like a stupid fucking brat..even now I‚Äôm being fucking dramatic because this is the shit my mom makes me think but she‚Äôs not even that abusive. I‚Äôm being a whiny fucking brat.

I feel stupid all the time for being a whiny brat and ruining everything. I‚Äôm not like everyone else I need to die for everything be be as it was,1
With the news happens lately I just can't hide my anger anymore. Social media didn;t even help at all. No way for me to live anymore. Goodbye cruel world.,1
I dont want to keep going.. I really hate waking up.. i dont want to wake up everyday and its just as shitty as the last one was.. I just want to sleep and dream forever.. i am happy in my dreams.. i am normal.. i really want to die but dont know how to.. I just want to sleep.. forever ,1
"I have other reddit accounts but need to post this under this account because quite frankly the name fits how I feel. This is long, but context, I wrote this right now after the thoughts and actions of last night.

Looking back, I think I was having a mental health crisis last night. For some reason, at dinner, I felt a wash of calmness come over me about my life. This calmness is¬†**not**¬†the type of calmness someone should have.¬†

I thought ‚Äúmaybe if I just go to sleep, the thoughts won‚Äôt be as prevalent‚Äù. Then I woke up in the middle of the night with these thoughts in my head the loudest they‚Äôve ever been. Then I bargained with myself ‚ÄúIf you write them down, then they are real, and you need help. If you don‚Äôt write them down; you‚Äôll be ok.‚Äù Finally, the voice was so loud I had no choice. I started to write from 4-7AM I was research and preparing.

When my sister died, we had a terrible time finding all her accounts and contacting her friends.¬†

Last night I took multiple steps in preparation.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Made a sheet with all my important account logins (with instructions on specific logins to make sure they don‚Äôt cancel things like my cell phone before all those are completed)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Located the deed to the house (at least I think it‚Äôs the deed)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Turned off things like two factor authentication on accounts wherever possible and FaceID

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Confirmed the beneficiaries of my employer life insurance policies? (Did you know that some policies through your employer only allow you to change your beneficiaries during either a life event or open enrollment?)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Tried to confirm if self-extermination would still pay out the above (in general policies apparently do after 2-3 years of being written ‚Äì always check your specific policy though)

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†What contact they should let know that I self-committed.

In addition to the above, I even started to do one of those online wills. But then I realized the following.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I need two people to sign my will. Who could I get to sign this without setting off alarm bells.

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†Would my last will and testament even be valid when it was created in crisis?

Then finally I started writing a letter to my mom. It wasn‚Äôt a letter explaining why I did the irreversible; but why I felt this way and how I promised her if I ever felt this way, I would seek emergency help. Then I questioned myself, ""Am I really at that point""?

I then decided to find a better definition of what it means to be in a mental health crisis. Does thinking about self-extermination make a crisis? If so, I‚Äôve been in one for years with varying intensity. Does preparing for the logistics of post expiration make a crisis? We all know that if someone attempts self-extermination they are in crisis. But what about before that? How do you recognize that you, yourself, in that moment, are in crisis and need help but don't have a fully thought out plan?

By this time, it was about 7AM. I decided that I am unable to work today and e-mailed my boss such. I almost slept on the floor of my bathroom because it is the only room that I could make completely dark to match how I felt. However, I did not go that far. I just kept the ac at the temp I normally sleep in and cocooned myself in my blanket in a tightness I have never done before and slept. If I woke up, I would just lay in my cocoon till I would fall asleep again. I kept doing this till now, 1500 US eastern.

I am telling myself I am writing this because I am unsure I need help, and I think I may have to go at least on a 72-hour hold, but because for me¬†

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I am unsure I was or even still am in crisis

¬∑¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†I bargained with myself that if they I can push a little harder and wait a little while longer; the feelings will go away, and then can try and just get through life.

The feelings aren‚Äôt going away, they may become subdued; but they do flare back. Even in this moment, as I close out this, I still wonder if I am crisis and need to seek emergency help. The scary thing is what they will do to me, and how at that point, I will truly feel like I have failed at life.

Maybe I‚Äôll stop barging with myself and go; maybe I won‚Äôt and just try and push it down again, hoping it doesn‚Äôt come back worse because; today‚Ä¶I fear by doing what I did above; I have made it 1000% times easier for me to go even further the next time these thoughts come around.",1
"I don‚Äôt want people to find my body and identify me. I don‚Äôt want them to know I‚Äôve killed myself. It‚Äôs better if I go missing. At least they don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôve given up. This shit is embarrassing.

I‚Äôve been thinking maybe I should swim out into the ocean. I‚Äôd get tired and drown. But I don‚Äôt think I can swim out far enough to not get my body washed ashore. I can‚Äôt hire a boat either. Can‚Äôt go with people. They‚Äôd know. ",1

"In almost 3 weeks, on August 3rd is my 15th birthday. I don‚Äôt know if I can keep going that long, but I don‚Äôt want to ruin my brother‚Äôs birthday just 5 days after my own. Even tho he doesn‚Äôt like me, I still love him. And I think he‚Äôd show at least a bit of care for me. Everyone is really excited for my birthday, but I can‚Äôt keep living and it pains me that everyone else is so happy for me while I‚Äôm laying here with my 3 attempts that no one knows off, thinking about making it 4 and not chickening out again. School will be over in 2 and a half weeks, starting summer vacation that will last for 6 weeks. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm able to stay home for that long. I‚Äôm extremely uncomfortable around my family. If I kill myself before or during it, I would ruin it for everyone. But I‚Äôm starting to stop caring if others care. It was not my choice to be born and I know it‚Äôs extremely selfish of me to think that way but I don‚Äôt want to live for anyone else anymore. Who knows, might also ruin everyone‚Äôs last weeks of school/ work today.

"Whenever I think I am standing up for myself, apparently not, I am just distroying myself and painting others in the bad light. I know I assume shit and sometimes I forget how nice ppl are and what they have done for me.

But is it bad to be hurt over something? I know I behave badly and rudely. I am cold and heartless sometimes. But I also sacrifice, I also do little things out of love. 

I can't say that or express it cause if not, I am just asking for credit and I don't see what they have done for me. Which I am not saying they didn't. I am just presenting my side of the story and when I defend myself they get angry and justify themselves more.

I trusted them, they have broken it many times. And I have too. This all is making me feel suicidal. I have come this far and faced many hardships before too.

But sometimes you know, I wish one of my attempts were successful. It was for a reason I was trying to die. Now I have too many reasons to live for, I have wasted my parents money too much and I have made them have hope. 

I wish I didn't give them that, I really want to die. Unlike in my last attempts. Right now I have access to tall buildings, can buy medicines I can overdose, I can hang myself without interruption for hours but I can't die even if I wanted to, I have to pay back all the favours and money only then I can die, which isn't for years.

I will be counting down each day, till I can die. Probably when I turn 36‚Ä¶ I wish I died when I was 10/11 cause I was depressed and wanted to die then too.

If I can go back in time, I want to tell myself that you are nothing special, your dreams are useless, even if you win, even if you come close to completing your dreams you will always be looked down upon cause of your gender.

You can't escape violence cause it will be inflected upon you one way or the other. I wish you tried harder to kill yourself. Once upon a time I tried to fight those thoughts and the ppl who told me that, it's ironic that I am gonna tell myself that again.

Don't trust others or yourself. Cause both will fail you. I wish I died long ago, at least then I wouldn't be a villain or someone who often commites mistakes that are unforgettable and unforgiving.",1
"I'm just so tired. I've been struggling for years and I just don't wish to continue struggling for the decades to come until my natural end. At the same time, I don't want my mother to suffer.

I‚Äôm stuck being 6ft and 197 pounds. I‚Äôm never going to get a girlfriend or anyone who will actually care a little for me just a little. I‚Äôm going to forever be made fun of by my peers. The closest I‚Äôve ever had to friends have been people touching me and bullying me.

"Sorry for the stupid title, i lack originality and will to think about it.

I'm male, 21 years old and living in Italy. I've felt depressed in the last years, but i think that it's only in the last two that i've got clinical depression. Sadly i don't have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist, it's just that my sadness is worst and i see nearly every symptom in me. 
I've always thought about the possibility of suicide, but never in a totally serious way until these last months. Now i'm searching ways to do it, thinking what and if leave something to the few people i care etc.

To be honest i don't know why i'm writing this. I was searching ways to kill myself and found this subreddit, then thought ""Why not?"". Now i feel even more pathetic to be honest, i've read a lot of stories here, people in huge pain and with big problems while i'm depressed just because of problems with myself and my family. It feels like i don't deserve to complain about it and that i'm just stupid to be sad.

Two days ago i was hanging me, but choose not to because i cannot leave my girlfriend alone. She's also depressed (actually diagnosed) and doesn't deserve more suffering, i'm trying to live in orser to make her less sad, but i don't know how long i'll be able to.
She wants me to go to therapy, but i don't think my parents can afford it and probably would think that i'm stupid, crazy or not really depressed if i'd tell them this. I don't work so i don't earn a thing, but i'm thinking that i could maybe work some months before/during uni lessons just to afford some therapy sessions... I don't know.

All my ""friends"" (Who call me a disapointment and just ignore me and hate me ig) all have the person who they'd pair with iykwim.

I'm the one suffering because of her. But to everyone else, she's just ""sick"" and ""needs to be given time"".

I have no friends. No support. No therapy. Nothing. And Because of this fucking stupid thing, I can't do shit. My family go out for food all the time for birthday's and special events, but I can't. Because I physically cannot force myself to go and eat with 20+ people (my family is giant). I hate it. I want to be normal. I want to be able to talk to people. I want to go to parties. I want to stay out late and hang around with people. I want to do things. I hate autism. Anybody who says ""autism is a superpower"" and ""Autism is an amazing thing"" is fucking lying.

"I have been trying to overcome it for a long time, but the thing is that since I was little, I have felt abandoned many times. By friends, family, and ex-partners.

I more or less managed to overcome the eating disorder, but this is the most complicated thing. I don't want to be afraid of being abandoned, but every time someone tells me they won't, they end up leaving.

"Almost all sources of happiness for me are gone, and those left became self-destructive because I abused them too much. My current and future circumstances as of now (3, 4 years) won't be different unless I change my habits. But since I can't do what makes me happy, I can't keep up with the short-term constructive lifestyle alterations. There's just no purpose behind it all. I'm the only one who can give meaning to life, and I fail to do so ever since. But earlier I had the things that brought me joy at least. 

Suicide is the epitome of egoism, and if I went through with it, I'd definitely destroy the lives of my parents. And I'm not selfish to that extreme. I'm already a failure and waste of potential, but I don't want my family to be depressed forever whenever they recall memories of me.",1
I am 15 and constantly get suicidal thoughts. I have a good life a decent house. I live in a ok area everything is fine. But I don‚Äôt know why I just have this thing in the back of my head that makes me hate life. And I go through random depressive episodes everyday. I got close to killing myself once. But ussually people who are depressed have problems I don‚Äôt have a lot other then I am ugly but it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. I have my parents right now so I go to them when I get these weird thoughts but what am I going to do when I grow up? What‚Äôs going to stop me from offing myself then? Does anyone have any idea how to help this other than medication because my parents are strongly against that. I‚Äôve tried therapy but all they told me was how to deal with the panic attacks and anxiety. It didn‚Äôt help much. But I feel stuck I don‚Äôt know what to do and I don‚Äôt want this part of me that makes me hate life for my whole life I won‚Äôt make it.

"Throwaway account 

I just build a house with my wife. I never wanted to do it but because I had/have troubles saying what is important to me we did it. And by we I mean me. I coordinated everything, worked my ass of while it was build and had an extremely tense and devastating year of 2023. my batteries were empty when the construction phase ended and I was deeply depressed. Then the moment came and we moved in and I have to say that I hate the house. On the one hand it‚Äôs loud and build on a place I never wanted to live but if I am truly honest, it‚Äôs the house itself. Everything it stands for - the way my life turned out and how it is filled with things I never wanted. I fell into a deep state of depression, lost 10kg (20lbs) since march and was crying almost every day. But I pulled myself out of this hole by going to my therapist, doing sports and then eventually taking medicine against my anxiety. I found some ground again when I was recognizing something on my stomache while doing some woodwork and I went to the hospital. 2 hours later I was in the OR getting operated on my belly. Everything was good, I went home, fell in the same depression and was hit by extreme pain 2 days later. Went to the hospital again and had to stay 7 more days because my wound was infected. Now I have to rest since 6 weeks. Can‚Äôt do sports, can‚Äôt really move and I am deeply unhappy. I find happy moments while doing music and I was brave (or call it dumb) and went to a concert this week. Wasn‚Äôt too good for the wound but I needed this. However there is this constant flow of darkness surrounding me and it just is there all the time. A couple of weeks ago at my lowest point I made plans to kill myself. Now they are reappearing over and over again. I stand up - I feel helpless - I count the hours on the clock until the day is over and I restart again. I am so lost. I hate this house, I hate my life, I am beginning to fall apart from my relationship, to my friends I feel like I am a liar and I can‚Äôt get rid of this constant pain. I don‚Äôt feel any good. I hate myself so much for this. I am sitting in a fancy new house, with a wife that loves me, yes I had surgery but that‚Äôs gonna heal and if I want to I can be a father soon. And so many would die for this - and I want to die because of it. What is fucking wrong with me??? ",1
"Not sure if anyone remembers my previous post but today the fated day. I‚Äôm taking 30 fluoxetine capsules and however many amount of Benadryl and hopefully that‚Äôll get the job done.

They gave me 60 capsules today instead of the usual 30 so if that‚Äôs not a sign then I don‚Äôt know what is ahaha. Some people just reach the end of the line quicker, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs something to be sad about, it‚Äôs natural. 

I‚Äôm looking forward to this, it‚Äôs the first time these thoughts have given me comfort and security and I‚Äôm all good with it now. Also I‚Äôll probably update as I go along today, we‚Äôll see what happens.

I‚Äôm going to see my family for the first time in years/meet new additions and I want to create a lasting memory and have some closure before I make my exit.

"I often get made fun of for my poor English skills, which makes me really anxious about speaking. Just thinking about it gives me panic attacks. My classmates tease me about how I look, so I don‚Äôt really consider them friends. I‚Äôve always dreamed of having a British accent, hoping it would help me fit in better. But most of the time, I feel lonely and isolated. At 19, I haven‚Äôt had the usual experiences like going to parties or having close friends. I worry about my future a lot and feel like I‚Äôve failed, even though I used to dream of being an astronaut since I was four. Agoraphobia keeps me indoors; I‚Äôm too scared to go outside, even when my family goes on trips. I constantly think about my flaws and feel empty, much more than just typical teenage struggles.

Living in a developed country where everyone speaks English fluently makes me feel even more inadequate. I get jealous when I hear someone from another country speak with a perfect accent and flawless grammar, and it makes me feel like I‚Äôm not brave enough. Even my relatives, including my cousin, call me a coward because I‚Äôm afraid to speak English. Whenever I try to speak, it usually ends with people laughing or avoiding me. High school was tough; I was bullied a lot, called names like ‚Äúmonkey,‚Äù and people made hurtful jokes. My self-esteem is low, and I think I‚Äôm unattractive and unwanted. Whenever there are team activities, I‚Äôm always seen as weak or left out when others pick their teams. My parents favor my lighter-skinned brother, which makes me feel unloved and constantly compared unfairly.

In my native country, it was no better. My kindergarten teacher used to make fun of me and physically abuse me so severely that it lasted for years until I moved to the UK at 14. The teachers there shamed and physically abused me for minor reasons, but where I lived, this treatment was normal. My parents were also harsh; they would beat me severely for even the smallest mistakes, never giving me a chance to learn. My so-called friends used to mock my appearance, calling me ugly and making me feel worthless. Now, at my age, people make fun of me because I‚Äôm still a virgin. It‚Äôs led me to smoke and drink beer, neglecting my self-care and feeling like I don‚Äôt matter anymore.

I have always been labeled as weak and a failure, especially by my dad who constantly tells me I will never succeed. He looks at me with disappointment, seeing only failure. I‚Äôve never achieved anything worthwhile; I feel like a coward and stupid too. Exams and assessments were always my worst nightmare; I consistently received the lowest marks. In group discussions, no one liked me because of my language barrier; they often ignored me or skipped over me altogether. I‚Äôm scared to become an adult because I feel too weak, and I worry that I‚Äôll end up alone. These thoughts weigh heavily on me, making me doubt my ability to handle adulthood.Oh and btw lm black 
l just feel like humanity has failed soo badly
Laughing at each other because of different skin colours it‚Äôs just stupid l wish for a better future

I wish I could give my life to someone who is dying and wants to live. That will be so great. That's such a selfish thing to think about you will think but dwag u have no one no one to cry on my funeral to it can't be selfish thing.
I feel like I'm mentally being bullied idk the right word to use here.  I heard my teacher he teaches the subject in which I'm really weak at and he is the one not doing his job properly because he was calling me out in some other  class which doesn't make any sense. He didn't help me in anyways in which I can do better. But he is calling me out in some other class which I'm not related to??? Why??? One was my formal friend told me this. I was just shocked why will an adult even think in that way.... there is whole lot of thing going in my life that is pretty interpersonal which no one knows and will never know.anyways i had exam last week I did fuck up really badly that badly that I feel like ending myself. Like this was the easy exam for all of us and I fucked that up. Made me realize that I don't have Aims in my life I have no knowledge to live further. Thinking to end up or overdosing myself with my close ones tb medicines I heard that those are really strong medicines so like I can skip tomorrow and have some time with myself and end tomorrow? I don't really want to end things but I really don't want to live either. I want to sleep and never wake up or i want to start earning already and stop with this education situation. Like I really don't understand and there is no one for me I can't even call someone my real friend ykwim. I feel really illiterate and unloveable. I'm going through a stage I don't want to live My hairs are all greasy I don't want to step in bathroom cause I have some plans there to end things. Im scared if someone saw me in that situation and i will still be alive or the pain tbh I told u yk I want to sleep and never wake up that typa death is my dream. By hearing my words you can tell I'm failure will be failure will be hated will be illiterate will be loner ahh that's it

"I‚Äôve been suicidal on and off for years. Most of my adult life, really.

There were times the thoughts were worse, I‚Äôd thought about how and where. I‚Äôd stashed pills ‚Äòjust incase‚Äô. I‚Äôd written notes. Never solid plans, but it was on my mind all the time. 

One night things got really bad and I had an episode that could have taken my life. I was ok but that was the start of me getting therapy and I worked on myself for years. I did eventually get better. I had turned my life around in a way and thought things were going to be good from then on. I was really proud of myself for all I‚Äôd overcome. I thought I had the chance of a good life, but it was a lie. It all crumbled. Long story short, the circumstances were all my fault but I lost the thing that mattered to me more than anything. My cat, I‚Äôd had her for 6 years since she was a kitten. I loved her so much. She was always there for me and she was the reason I didn‚Äôt act on my thoughts to end it, when the pain became overwhelming. I knew no one would love her how I did, so I stayed. Then I got better and always promised her that I‚Äôd keep getting better and build a good life for us. Instead I fell for a man who claimed to love me, but just used and abused me instead. My self esteem and identity and all the work I‚Äôd done to heal was undone. Worst was what happened with me giving up my cat, only for her to die, which was the most traumatic thing I‚Äôve been through. I died that day too, really. Nothing has been ok since then. Not really. It is all my fault she is gone. She saved my life and I betrayed her.

I tried to heal. I really did. From the outside people would think I‚Äôm doing great. I left the toxic relationship. I got a new job. New place to live. Even eventually rescued a sweet dog from the shelter, who I of course do love, but it‚Äôs just not the same. It isn‚Äôt the same connection. It isn‚Äôt enough for me to stay for. The emptiness I feel without my soul cat is too great. The pain of her being gone, knowing it was my fault and she didn‚Äôt have to go, it‚Äôs unbearable. The anger I feel towards myself, and the anger towards my ex who broke me down and took everything from me. He got to move on without any consequences. While I am left a shell of who I was. I lost my life. 

I have fought before. I have been strong before, but I always had her to comfort me. This time is different. I am more tired than ever. It‚Äôs been over 3 years since then. 3 years of trying to move on without her. I don‚Äôt know if I can keep trying. I don‚Äôt want to die, but I need all this pain to stop. I dont take care of myself anymore. I‚Äôm doing the bare minimum to survive. 

I‚Äôm just surviving out of shame now really. Because I don‚Äôt want this dog to have to go back to the shelter, and because my house is a mess and I don‚Äôt want anyone to find it this way. I‚Äôm trying to work on organising my things, but I don‚Äôt have the energy. Maybe it‚Äôs for the best, because I worry about how I‚Äôll go with 1 less reason to stay when I already have so few. 

I‚Äôm just exhausted. It got better before, but I really don‚Äôt think it will this time. I‚Äôve lost too much. ",1

 I‚Äôm sick and tired of this life. I‚Äôve been through so much in life i could write a book and to top it off, my fianc√© took his own life last year. I haven‚Äôt even hit 25 yet and my life feels ruined. ill never love someone the way I loved him. i‚Äôll never get to have children now (pretty sure I can‚Äôt anyways due to endometriosis) or be married. i‚Äôll never have my happily ever after (by choice, I refuse to find a new partner) i‚Äôll never be the same person I once was.  

I‚Äôve had on and off depression for years and i‚Äôm TIRED of it. i‚Äôm tired of faking like life is okay when it isn‚Äôt. i‚Äôm tired of hiding how I really feel. I‚Äôm miserable. I‚Äôve tried taking my own life in dumb ways (OTC pills and eye drops, i know. dumb.) and of course I never took enough to cause actual damage. The worst part is i‚Äôm scared to do anything further because I don‚Äôt want to feel pain. It‚Äôs cowardly. Everyone says someone who truly wants to take their life will just do it, but it‚Äôs hard. This isn‚Äôt a cry for help, it‚Äôs just how i really feel. 

Every time i‚Äôve tried, I got so sick and regretted it simply because I was still alive and throwing up. Never went to the hospital for any of my attempts. I suffered in my room in silence. My 2nd to last attempt I research for hours on drinking Visine (yes, the eyedrops). I drank 6 bottles and guess what? Nothing. I felt like I was nodding out and two days later I was back to normal. I was in the car with my friends and they didn‚Äôt even notice meanwhile my heart rate was slowing and i was losing hearing a bit. i fell asleep in my car and woke up hours later still alive. Why is it so hard?

 I hate expressing how I feel because then everyone looks at you like a charity case or says how ungrateful you are. I have been on depression meds, hate them. I won‚Äôt talk to a therapist or anything because advice doesn‚Äôt help me. I will fake like it does but it truly doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm so tired of being here!!! I‚Äôm so so fucking tired. ‚ÄúIt gets better‚Äù Yes, it does for some people but i‚Äôm not one of them. I‚Äôve had suicidal ideations daily for YEARS. I want to swallow all the pills I have right now but I can‚Äôt even fathom the fact of ANOTHER failed attempt and getting sick. Worst case scenario waking up in a hospital room with my family crying wondering what they could do differently. 

I miss my fianc√©, I want to be with him. I don‚Äôt want to feel this pain anymore. I‚Äôm so miserable and there‚Äôs only one way out but it‚Äôs so hard to reach. It sounds sick but I pray every day that someone with a terminal illness and I can switch places. I would do it in a heartbeat. There‚Äôs so many people who want to live and don‚Äôt get the chance, why can‚Äôt I take their spot? I‚Äôm not selfish, I know how it sounds but it‚Äôs just how my brain is wired. I‚Äôm tired of heartbreak, waking up every day, having to pretend like I love life. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my family and I know people have it worse than I do, but man I just want to be gone. I don‚Äôt want my family to feel the way I feel about my fianc√© leaving me which is why I hope for a freak accident or something to happen to me so they don‚Äôt have to feel guilt. i‚Äôm desperate to leave this world and I wish someone understood that.

"I'm 33. I've been married almost 10 years to an incredible man. My children are 6 and 4. But I've been suicidal since I was 12. I've lived with deep depression ever since. Twenty long grueling years of pain and struggle and mental breakdowns and tears. Living has been AGONIZING. It takes everything inside me to get up every day and take care of my house and husband and kids and a full time job and family and friends and pets. I can't mask it anymore. I can't pretend everything is ok. I've dealt with relationship trauma, family trauma and drama, financial ups and downs, medical issues upon medical issues, and truthfully just terrible luck. Every corner I turn there's a challenge and a struggle. Simple things are never simple.

I'm done. I surrender. I quit. I feel like I'm being held hostage to stay alive. How can someone else tell me that I should keep living or not? Should that be up to the person actually having to live that life?

I have so many people that are clueless to how I feel on a daily basis. I've been able to put on a front for so long. But if I'm not allowed to end my life, then I will slowly kill myself. I started smoking again. Getting very high once everyone is asleep. I'm done taking care of myself. 

It would be easier on everyone, especially my husband and kids, if I could just slip out the metaphorical back door and everyone could be at peace. They wouldn't have me to deal with and infect their life anymore. And I wouldn't have to be in pain. But I can't. I'm stuck here and it's bullshit. 

I recorded messages for people closest to me. I thought that would wake me up and make me keep going but it just felt like another check mark forward on this journey to end my life. I've been getting rid of my things slowly so that it's a minimal burden on those if and when I go.

I don't feel like it's if, but when.....but how? I'm trapped in this nightmare hamster wheel with no way out. ",1

"About a year ago I tried to kill myself but didn‚Äôt have follow through. I made multiple cuts to my neck over the course of a like 5 hours the night before I had to go to work. Even did pushups during and starting drinking liquor to help blood flow but I have this stupid feeling of self preservation I stopped once the blood flow from my neck really started. Was able to get someone‚Äôs attention outside my building then was rushed to hospital given stitches and put in inpatient rehab for a month where I learned some great techniques that were very effective in the controlled environment. Once I left the facility I moved back with my family and got a job and just sort of moved on. I was hopeful, but overtime the looks people give me is starting to get to me. I feel like they all know where the scar comes from. I know they don‚Äôt, but I also don‚Äôt know.

"Hi, it's 03:32 AM when I'm writing this. I guess I just will write what's on my mind and maybe feel better after that. So, I'm 16, I have an amazing boyfriend and I love him so fucking much... I can't even describe how much I love that boy.

I had my first suicidal thought when I was 14. Bad things happened involving someone I really cared about. I remember I was crying so much, and then I thought about fucking killing myself for the first time. After that, more shit started to happen, with that I begun with the selfharm and after that, smoking, just to try to feel less pain. The fact is: in the last 2 years, a LOT of shit have been happening to me all the time and you know what? It's not like I'm not blamed for some of them. Last year, I had my first suicide attempt after a breakup. My parents were there to give me all the support I needed and that makes me feel like the worst person in the world. They don't deserve it. They deserve better, they deserve a child who don't fucking give problems. Does that makes sense? I don't have idea. I started dating my boyfriend in June 3 and things got better since then, but sometimes I feel like I'm not enough, and with sometimes I mean every fucking day. I want him to be happy and I'm fucking sure he won't be happy having to deal with trash like me. I'm so lucky to have him by my side but I hate myself so much that I catch myself thinking that I don't deserve to be happy and in fact I don't deserve any happiness. I'm a hopeless teenager whose only future certainly is death. I should just kill myself already and then my boyfriend would find someone better. Someone who don't selfharm every fucking day, someone who don't need to smoke to feel alive, someone better. Someone who won't give problems and will give him happiness. If by some reason you still reading this shit, I'm sorry for wasting your time, friend. Live a happy life and don't be a useless fucking trash as I did. 
I just need a final trigger to do it. I got ways to do it, I know how to do it, but I'm a fucking coward who have fear of pain. I want to die but I don't want to feel pain. Makes sense? Probably not. Since I can't talk about those things with the people around me, I guess this is the right place to say stuff like that. Just needed to put it out. Again, sorry for wasting your time.",1

"On top of my suicidal urges. I have this weird desire to hurt others, nobody in particular. I feel I might not do it, but I can't deny the thought crosssmes my mind when I'm with someone. I am frankly disgusted by myself for wanting to kill others. 

Whenever I'm alone I have had vivid though brief fantasies, they feel so real and I have this rush of adrenaline from it, so much infact that I start shaking and I can feel my heart beat out of my chest.

 It's like an intrusive thought. I know very well that I most likely don't have the capacity for this kind of violence but the thought alone is still admittedly horrific. There dosen't seem to be any restrictions on who I think on, it's not decided by hate or by connection, it just happens. I don't believe I would hurt let alone kill another human being, but I can't say that these graphic and violent thoughts don't entice me.

"I'm 48. Single. Gay. I've been struggling with my mental health for decades. I've had 8 therapists. Tried 4 different meds (one has worked well enough to keep me alive so far). I've given up drinking, surrounded myself with a great support network who I support too. I could write a book on my own mental health.I got fit. Gave up defined sugar. Get cardio maybe 4 or 5 times a week. I'm popular, smart, funny, talented, warm, welcoming, I have dozens of friends. And well over 10 close ones. I make friends easily. I am luckier than 99.99% of people who have ever lived. I live in one of the best countries in the world for LGBT rights. But I've been lonely all my life. A lot of LGBT people of my generation suffer from loneliness because they hide their true selves from everyone in their life for a long time. There's a barrier there and we learn to live with emotional isolation.I've watched my 3 younger siblings have relationships, get married, have children, settle down. I have never had a relationship. The loneliness for affection is debilitating. I feel worthless and old. My poor mental health means I struggle with employment. I find it reasonably easy to find work but end up in incredible emotional pain after a few months. And then leave. I am approaching my 50th birthday and it makes me feel like a failure. I have thought about suicide at least once every day for over a year. I rang the suicide help line a few months ago. Attended therapy with them. But they're focussed on crisis management. This isn't a crisis. This is the way I live. A life of feeling like this is tortuous and doesn't seem worth it. It seems to be getting worse as I get older. My hope of recovery is fading. I don't know what to do. ",1

"I once again have found myself looking into exit bags and OD medications. The other simpler, n the moment methods just scare me to much with the pain that you‚Äôll endure during or even after if I‚Äôm unsuccessful. I wish I could look past the physical pain, and accept that it‚Äôs a small price to pay to end lifelong agony that awaits me. Bipolar is too much wait to bear for me, and the loved ones around me. I can tell my friends, colleagues and work management hate me now. They can‚Äôt stand my lack of communication of missing work, events, or other things. I reach out, and no support that they can give helps me. I just wish to die, a quiet and soft death. 

I wish I was brain dead, just a vat of meat that goes through the day, outside of the reality of my tired heart. I continue to hurt the ones who care about me. Just broke up with my partner in a manic episode and yearn to ask for help from them, but I can‚Äôt hurt them again. Then I think of the one who got away years ago, and I think of her everyday. I can‚Äôt even say that her hating me is a personal delusion, people have told me, she‚Äôs told me. I‚Äôm a selfish asshole, ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô, ‚Äòhow could anyone love you‚Äô. I don‚Äôt know how anyone could either. I can‚Äôt reach out to her, and I know my friends resent the way I‚Äôve treated both her and my most recent partner.

The thing is, I am still not well with my mental health, and sometimes I do think about killing myself. The thing is, before i tried slitting my wrists i didn't like the idea at all since (like eveyone) I thought ""that must hurt"" but i was actually surprised by how little it hurts, well, by how little i cared about how much it hurt and where it reaches a certain point where you learn to ignore it, so the idea of attempting it again is always at the back of my head thinking ""whatever, it doesnt even hurt that much""",1

"In 1882, Fredrich Nietzche wrote about the thing he called ""the heaviest burden"", or what we also know as eternal recurrence. More than simply reincarnation, it's the idea that our lives will be repeated in an endless cycle and nothing will be different.

""This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence.""

The point of what he wrote was not to speculate about what comes after death, but to invite us to think about how would we react to such knowledge. Would we reject it? Or embrace it?

Sometimes I think the only thing keeping me here is the fear that what he wrote was true.

Today I'm 28 and I can say with no shadow of a doubt that I trew down the drain my 20's I had bouts of depression and ideations would come from time to time. Aditionally I expirienced some depersonalization at times and a very bad period of obbsesive compulsive thoughts that wrecked me.

I left myself be dragged by my own life, I had relathionship that meant the world to me, I can see how if I got any better it was because of her, she made me keep going. But wasn't as happy as she should and left, I don't blame her, she put up with so much shit from me. She did enough.

Her loss made me loose my shit, I didn't / don't recognize myself, I tried to do better, did all the shit I was told to do, ALL of the stupid things they tell you to do, I did. Not going to lie I shortly felt better, wich wasn't difficult given the state I was in a few months ago but I never felt alright. Eventually I went back to being a mess.

I'm a crying mess at home, at work, when I shower, when I drive, when I wake up or go to sleep. I lost 22 pounds, I feel weak, snacks are 3/4 of my diet, I've got nightmares, I feel hopeless etc  I'm not detached enough to not see how this is really concerning. I almost end things on march 27, had several intense mental breackdowns, the ideations were crazy but they calmed down until last month when they started to get out of hand again, but different this time.

They used to make me feel scared and desperate now it almost comes with a sense of acceptance. They come I see them and it's like if it were normal. I often catch myself imagining how the scene would look like, I searched how to do it safely, if I see smt that could make it happen I register it in my head.

The night of saturday I drove to the abandoned train station of my village, I sat down with a drink and snaks in front of the tracks at night several hours registering at what times the trains pass. As I sat down against an old wall I thought of death, things I lost and sobbed, the roar of the train against the rails, the vibration on the floor and up to my body and the strong air flow they cause passing by had a total different feeling that night.

I'm really worried, this is not fucking normal. Aditionally I'm scared for the people around me and the emotional impact I would cause on them. It would be very shitty of my part to let them know.",1
"This is about to be a ramble but my life has absolutely amounted to nothing. But everyday feels like a busy, heavy burden even though im doing nothing everyday? I sit here and think about how much pain im in and how has my life ended up to being nothing. I keep waiting for something to change like some kind of magical amount of money will come in and fix everything for me, or my husband will all of the sudden start showing so much affection for me I‚Äôll actually feel loved, or all my anger and self hatred will just go away if I just wait one more day. Idk if I can wait anymore. It‚Äôs just the same thing everyday. My breaking point tonight is that I fear my husband is cheating on me because he won‚Äôt share his password to his phone and it bothers me but I try really hard to not let it bother me(he‚Äôs never let me touch his phone for maybe 10+ years?? After I went through his phone and found out he was snap chatting like 5 different girls) ever since that he‚Äôs been pro level at hiding his phone it‚Äôs actually amazing at this point but at the same time I‚Äôm not trying to find out I don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ why am I even here why am I rambling this isn‚Äôt my diary I‚Äôm so sad I just want to leave. This is so stupid bye. ",1

"I can't do it anymore, there's no future for me, it's all fucked, its always been fucked, I can't make anything out of my life and I don't think I'll ever be happy with anything I choose. The next time they are all out of the house and I'm alone I'm going to use the bullet I keep in my wallet to shoot myself, they are going to Branson in a few weeks for vacation, I already told them I don't want to go, the day they leave is the day I'll go through with it.",1
"Just a little update, not that anyone gives a shit, just thought I'd speak my mind. Shit has not gotten easier. Still just as sad. Even more depraved at this point. Fantasies are getting more frequent to the point it's uncomfortable. The only motivation I have left is the fact that I might move out soon. But that will be after my 18th birthday. So... I don't know. I might postpone my suicide. I might not. We'll see. 

I'm getting to the point where my anxiety evolves into full on agoraphobia. It's already getting there. I think it's because I feel filthy. I'm afraid someone will find out about my desires. I've semi told one of my friends. Only part of it. Only the rape shit. I've been lusting over scenarios like that a lot more nowadays. Anytime I'm alone with anyone my mind starts stirring, and my cock goes hard. I guess it's kinda counterproductive to post ABT my desires when it's so easy to connect to me irl, oh well. 

I've also found that I haven't matured much since I was rlly young. Or maybe I devolved at some point, either way, in my mind I always see myself as a younger boy than I am, and I actually like that too. Whenever everyone else has actual responsibilities they manage to balance, I can't even study for an hour. Oh well. Goodbye, I'm getting bored, and I forgot what else I was gonna say. ",1
"My mom really hates me, so does my dad. Actually I don‚Äôt think anybody in my family really liked me in the first place, but I guess it hurts even more when my mom keeps reminding me of how ungrateful and selfish I am. She‚Äôs been coming in and yelling about it since I relapsed earlier today, about how she does everything for me but I don‚Äôt even bother to care about how she feels, how I get everything I want in life always. That I do not do anything else but continue to destroy myself, making myself uglier than I already am. She always says stuff like that when she gets mad at me, but this time I guess it truly was my fault for well, relapsing. I‚Äôm sorry. ",1

"Women are forcing be to make this decission. Never having a girlfriend and sex makes life worthless. Last months, maybe years women have made my mental health worse and worse and one time my limit will be reached. They have choosen to ignore me for 23 years and now my conclusion is that going on with life is useless and I will have to take things in my own hand and commit suicide. I am so angry and frustrated at the moment and I am not happy that women forced to do this. When I was young I was thinking life would be great but now I know that its the opposite. My parents knew that getting a girlfriend would be difficult, and yet they did nothing about it. My life untill I came to highschool was good, but now its time to acknowledge that some people's lifes are longer and others are shorter and I guess I am one with a shorter lifespawn. Well again, thanks women for making my life a living hell, I hope you all are proud of yourself.",1

She never lets me do shit so I stay home all day like a fucking bum because she hasn‚Äôt let us leave the house because she‚Äôs scared that we will fuck up like my brother (we all already are she just doesn‚Äôt know) won‚Äôt support me in shit and at school not much better, don‚Äôt have social skills fat ass so just get bullied by my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and my parents also won‚Äôt cut me a break about my weight and make fun of me for it along with the rest of my family when I just eat to cope with this shit.

update 10 hours later: hey everyone, i genuinely appreciate the advice, care, and concern from everyone:) im honestly sorry for worrying people this much, but I'm totally fine.

"I'm the type of person to just relax all day. I don't want to do anything but that. I'm lazy. I contribute fuck all to the world around me.

I just dont care any more. Like I'm suppose to fly out wednesday and I might not even get on the plane. That's how much I dont care. Should I tell my dad? Hes a big boy he will have to get over it. I just am done. With everything. Lost the coolest house. Now all my stuff is in storage. I had a storage but had to get a new one cause my old one that held all my sentimental things well they are all moldy. Dead people's things anyways who cares. I shouldn't be sentimental I guess. The universe has spoken. So now what I have left is going into another storage cause I don't have a way to find a home. My truck will need to be towed somewhere because its broke down outside said home. I'm doing everything by myself and I work two jobs and had a shit ton to do before I fly out and i didnt get to do anything. Except my hair i tried to do that but i wrecked it now i look like shit. My phone fried the other day so I'm with out phone. I'm using wifi to communicate which let's face it know one talks to me. My boyfriend is a piece of ahit so i broke up with him but I'm disorganized attached and i cant help but beg for him back because I have no self worth. He finally blocked me cause he is tired of me even though all I'm doing is begging him to abuse me because that's all I know. See thing is I've been on this mental health journey healing 40 years of abuse and I was actually doing ok till I met him and then I lost everything and now him so I'm dysregulated and suicidal because let's face all reality... mental health is bs. No body cares. I have zero family other then the adopted dad and I dont give a ahit if he is mad I miss my flight. I just dont give a shit about anything. All my self growth went out the window and I turned off all my give a Fs. Just keeping it real. To bad I'm a coward and I'll never follow through. I never do.

Im never going to find a serious relationship. ending it tonight ,1
"So, I‚Äôve pretty much decided it‚Äôs time. I‚Äôve got my method figured out and supplies ready- won‚Äôt disclose because it‚Äôs costly and will surely do the job, with the least amount of pain. Last time I attempted the gun misfired, that was a few years ago and I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to do it again.

That was what I thought was the lowest point in my life. I‚Äôve wanted to die since I was 7, I was always different from everyone else, and bullied horribly for it. I transitioned into a girl when I was in my mid-teens. Got addicted to meth and heroin, and I just planned on using until I died. Unfortunately that didn‚Äôt happen fast enough and after 6 overdoses I guess I thought I couldn‚Äôt die. My family member actually was there with me one time and left me there alone in case I died and police showed up. I woke up projectile vomiting.
By the time I had gotten out of addiction I was an adult and my father (RIP) got diagnosed with an incurable degenerative disease and passed a few years later. I was working in the service industry and didn‚Äôt think about school.
 
One day I met my stbxh. When I tell you it was like the sky opened up and everything came together believe me, it was magical. I left the service industry for a better career path during covid, and started to actually make good money. Everything was looking good and I was feeling okay for once, but we (stbxh) were off and on every few months. Nothing and nobody compared to him, and I could never forget him, never could be with anyone else. So after a year separated, we got back together. Eventually we got married, I thought he had really changed. 

I ended up leaving my job to be a sahw. Life happened, time passed and one day he sat me down and said he wanted a divorce. The one person I ever truly loved and could see myself with, the most perfect man in the world really just pulled the rug out from under me again. Except this time I lost everything. Our home is his property, I had no job, no health insurance, nothing to fall back on except my mother. She and I share the same bed because all the other rooms are occupied by other family members. All of my stuff is still in boxes because there‚Äôs nowhere to put it. 

I really tried hard to pull myself out of it, I got a new job, got accepted into school, saved up for one of my passions, but the truth is that I can‚Äôt even think about enjoying any of the rewards of my hard work. I have literally no friends (none, I am completely alone and always have been. Except for one friend who I don‚Äôt talk to anymore because even that relationship was codependent), my family is addicted and dysfunctional, my poor cat misses her father and yowls every night, and the love of my life disposed of me once again like nothing. All I‚Äôve ever wanted was to be loved like that, and I had it. Now it‚Äôs gone and I think about the life I‚Äôm creating now and it‚Äôs meaningless. I think about the future and it‚Äôs bright and fruitful, but it‚Äôs meaningless. I know I won‚Äôt ever feel that way for someone else and there‚Äôs no job, possession or accomplished dream that can replace it. My options are just too narrowed as a trans person.

So here I am at the even lower lowest point in my life. I‚Äôm ready, and I‚Äôm gonna make sure I don‚Äôt fail this time. I just really needed to tell someone because this has been a secret I‚Äôve kept to myself for decades now so I don‚Äôt end up hospitalized. I‚Äôve really thought about my options and this is truly the only feasible solution, I won‚Äôt ever be happy like I once was and I will be alone forever. And I‚Äôm so envious of people who can thrive like that but I‚Äôm not one of those people. I‚Äôm tired of being alone. I‚Äôm rambling, I‚Äôm sorry. I just needed to get this off my chest because no one knows. I know, this whole thing sounds stupid and pathetic. That‚Äôs definitely how I feel right now. Stupid, alone, thrown out, codependent and pathetic.

"Someone just one person at least please read this. No one will listen to me. 

I‚Äôm 16 

I split with my best friend of many years because she had begun physically abusing me and then I told her I thought I was going to kill myself and she blatantly didn‚Äôt care. That was the beginning of the end. 

A few months later, she spread rumours all around my school that I lied about a bunch of random shit, the state I was born, my sisters name, my self harm, etc that I didn‚Äôt, but no one believes me for some reason, even though it‚Äôs so easy for me to disprove to everyone. Everyone is constantly talking so bad about me saying horrible and disgusting things and I couldn‚Äôt take it. So I stopped going to school for pretty much the rest of the year. I‚Äôve been suicidal constantly since this, which was in April. 

Then my parents kicked me out but then randomly out of nowhere reported me missing when they found a paper I wrote before. It basically said if I didn‚Äôt check on them before the 20th I‚Äôm in danger but DO NOT report me missing under my birth name. For context I had my name legally changed and the original name is my most well guarded secret and embarrassment. Not sure why but hearing it makes me wanna seriously kill myself no joke. 

I said in the letter I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself so not to worry because they knew about how I‚Äôve been the past few months UNLESS they reported me under my birth name after the 20th. Then guess fucking what they reported me missing despite kicking me out under my fucking birth name. There would be absolutely no reason they‚Äôd need to used this name, it‚Äôs not my legal name, it‚Äôs on none of my IDs. They were telling me to do it. They got me put in police custody and a mental ward, the worst experiences of my life. 

Now I‚Äôm getting further and further off the deep end by the day. I‚Äôve started thinking my pets have been replaced by spies and every typing error I‚Äôve made in this I‚Äôve taken as I sign from God to kill myself. I got super worked up before writing this and usually I‚Äôd be calm by now but I‚Äôm not. 

Tldr everything is fucking horrific and I‚Äôm killing myself tonight. 

I have everything set up. ",1

"I'll start by saying im 25 years old, I have two young children with my girlfriend. We live in a trailer and a month and a half ago, I lost my job. I worked a very dangerous job where i picked up an addiction from substances my boss and other coworkers put me on to during my time working with them, not to say they are the reason for my addiction, but they introduced me to that specific drug. After a long period of time struggling with that addiction I was finally able to let go of it for a couple weeks before I got into an argument with my boss in which resulted in my job loss. My house is falling apart, the bills keep coming, my girlfriend is the only one working despite my constant efforts to find work. I've applied to so many places indiscriminately. Fast food, walmart, I have even knocked on hundreds of doors trying to sell yardwork. I dont know what I'm doing wrong, what kind of impression I must be giving off for this to happen. I feel like a complete failure, I have no family thats outside of prison to talk to or beg for help and my girlfriends family is not well off enough to provide any assistance. I feel like me dying would be the most beneficial thing that could happen for my kids, for them to have someone that isnt weak or someone that can provide the life i always wanted for them. I wanted so bad to be that person but years keep passing and the feeling of uselessness that I am is just building.

"By all accounts I have a lot of my life together. A master‚Äôs degree, a high stress career that doesn‚Äôt pay enough considering I often work 70 hour weeks and carry all the stress, but I‚Äôm struggling to find anything in my field that‚Äôs remote and pays the same. 

Plus, if a recession is coming, my position is about as safe as I can get, minus it killing me from stress. I just worked a 75 hour week and cried multiple times from stress. I work 9-5, then nights and weekends, and never get to leave work at work.

I‚Äôm 32 and through all of my 20s I had my own apartment, but couldn‚Äôt save anything because of rent prices. The last few years, I had the most awful neighbors of my life at two different apartments, and a roach nightmare. I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore, but I couldn‚Äôt afford a house on my own.

Then I moved into my parents‚Äô house to save,  but I‚Äôm suffering mentally by giving up my freedom. Everything in my life feels out of control. 

And despite saving a down payment, the goal post keeps moving and prices and mortgage rates go up and up and up and I can‚Äôt keep up. It will still be years before there‚Äôs remotely any hope.

I‚Äôm extremely introverted and need alone time to function. Little things keep happening and I never get any peace between work, parents, personal life. If I could just get my own place again I think I could cope, but every time I meet a savings goal I‚Äôm still further away from being able to afford this shit because the housing market gets worse. And if I even discuss the idea of just renting again, I get screamed at by my mom and called ungrateful and stupid.

I‚Äôm just losing it this weekend and all my brain wants is to not have to deal with anything anymore. If there was an easy switch to end it all I‚Äôd flip it tonight.",1

But im pretty sure im going to do it tonight. I‚Äôve had a rough life if that‚Äôs how I should put it, a lot of bad things have happened to me. And for a while I thought I was getting better, but it turns out that was fake. It doesn‚Äôt really improve for me. Up and down, back and forth of happy and sad. I‚Äôve dealt with depression for some time now. And the past few weeks I‚Äôve sort of been driving myself crazy. I‚Äôve also not had a good relationship with the people around me. Me and my mom have been arguing or fighting a lot despite my efforts to avoid it, trying to be better, etc. my siblings hate me. They tell me that everyday and they‚Äôve just resorted to insulting me and telling me to kill myself. I don‚Äôt have any friends nor do I have anyone im romantically involved with. I‚Äôm alone 99% of the time. I have nobody, I am nobody. I am a living embodiment of nothingness, of failure. 

I try to be a good person. I do good things, I help people whenever I can. I have a job and I‚Äôve been in school. I have always made a point of being there for others in any way possible. But nobody gives me the same. People either use me for money or try to use me for sexual things. That‚Äôs all I am to anyone. Someone they can use, who they know won‚Äôt argue. I‚Äôm a pushover, a failure, a disappointment, and so much worse. 

And I was having a bad day again, and my mother and I had to argue. Like the universe had an itch it needed to scratch. And now im sitting here crying planning everything out. I have no notes to write. Maybe one to my mother apologizing for doing her the disservice of being her child, of ruining her life just by being in it. And just a general note of what I‚Äôd like done with my things and my pets. I hope they get taken care of nicely when I‚Äôm gone and I hope my things don‚Äôt just get thrown away, but if they should, I understand that decision as well. 

I know I can‚Äôt talk about methods or anything so I won‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt plan on doing it in a messy way, I‚Äôve cleaned everything so I don‚Äôt have to burden anyone with the cleanup afterwards.

I lost hope and stopped caring. it feels like the end, did my 20 something years, worth a try but ultimately not really worth it. as far as I know myself, im gonna chicken out at the last moment anyway, but I like to believe that I'm finally able to do it when the pain becomes unbearable.

"Writing this partly to leave some kind of record and edge myself forward. On a vpn so nobody bother try track me.

After 31 years I'm calling it quits. The last seventeen or so years have been, for the most part, utter misery. No idea how I survived this long but I refuse to any longer. There is quite simply nothing for me in this world. When I was at least somewhat materially comfortable I could keep myself distracted. I hesitate to say happy, but I wasn't constantly thinking about suicide.

Now I am homeless. Can't even get a spot in a hostel or any other kind of temporary housing. Charities and government-adjacent organisations do quite literally NOTHING apart from check that you've essentially registered as homeless (day one obvious stuff) and are aware of where to get a free meal every day. Presumably this is all they do all day and they are paid for it. Bizarre. Glorified directories.

I was on and off various SSRIs for years. Always been skeptical of them but in times of desperation I would go for it. Maybe some small benefit after a few months but hard to tell if it was that or other self improvement things I was trying. Either way, no meaningful difference. Therapy was a joke. Unfortunately, therapy and SSRIs are the only thing medical professionals recommend. ""I know you've tried A, B, C, D and E.... but you haven't tried F yet!"". Fuck you. Another flavour of pill is not going to change me, and my refusal to try is not proof I'm not serious about wanting to get better.

Despite having a long history of depression, whenever I've spoken to them recently they just latch onto the fact that I'm homeless. Obviously its not nice, but that's really not my issue. Worse still, it is very clear they think I'm just trying to score some free food from them and get somewhere to sleep indoors for the night. I've been to A&amp;E three times in five months. One time I was on the very edge of ending it, but they talked me down. The next time I visited I overheard them talking and they flat out stated they thought I was grifting so I left and decided to never speak to them again.

Last roll of the dice was to see my doctor because generally they're more qualified than the social workers role playing as mental health professionals. In addition to SSRIs and therapy she also recommended Jesus. In fairness, my medical history may have had my past beliefs on there which made her comfortable bringing it up - but what the fuck. Won't be going there again. 

Family are trash and not worth talking about. Haven't seen them in years and wouldn't want to. No friends either and I always have to ask myself why. I had them in school which is relatively easy when you're forced to see each other nearly every day. Genuinely enjoyed their company and would sometimes have periods where I would see them outside but it always burned me out after a while and I would pull back. We drifted apart but no hard feelings on my end. I was also involved in a bit of a scandal which definitely was my doing so that finalised things. Met nice people at various jobs but always kept things confined to the office and the occasional work party. Had a few girlfriends but never made it past early stages. The desire to keep it going was never there and I was happier alone. I'd have periods in my life where I told myself ""relationships aren't supposed to be easy, I need to sacrifice more"" and I would always end up hurting myself. Maybe I'm high functioning autistic or have some kind of personality disorder, who knows. Numerous professionals have asked if I'm ""sure"" I haven't been diagnosed with anything but they never press further.

Social issues aside, I have other flaws. I've always been lazy at work. I have known for long time that lack of sleep is a significant driver of my depression but efforts to correct this never lasted longer than a few weeks. I've drank alcohol excessively at points and gotten into some terrible states, though I have ""quit"" for months at a time when I felt like it. FWIW I've not had a drop in months, can't enjoy it living like this. I messed around with a married woman for a brief period despite her having kids and knowing she probably only latched onto me because of family issues she was having. Saying mean shit online. I have been cold to people and sometimes relished in knowing they were feeling hurt. Me simply getting involved in anyone's life knowing I will eventually make a mess.....its not right. This isn't just bad social skills, something else is wrong and I can't make it work despite a general desire to do the right thing and strong aversion to anything outright evil. The willpower isn't there to change myself in any meaningful way.

I've rambled. The burst of emotion which prompted this has faded but the final mission is still scheduled.

Fuck you to:
Teachers at school who witnessed me having a personality transplant overnight and never thought to ask what was wrong.
99% of homeless charities - and homeless people quite frankly.
The NHS. It's dogshit and needs to be pulled by the roots (not just based on my experience)

Thank you to:
My past girlfriends. Love will always be there, sorry I couldn't make it work.
My last two friends. It was only a year but it was special. And I promise I didn't fancy you-know-who. Objectively gorgeous but purely platonic on my end. 
People at work who tolerated me more than was reasonable. 
Everyone from church. Sorry for sudden departure.
The two charities that offered real help.

When I go, it won't be messy. Just a long sleep. Let's see what's next.

"I need somewhere to get this out. I feel so lonely, and not even just an emotional loneliness, I genuinely am. My mother kicked my brother and I out after this huge fight about a lawsuit about a stupid will the rest of my family dragged us into. My fathers not alive anymore, which I mean, I‚Äôm kind of grateful for because he was heavily physically abusive. It‚Äôs just me and my brother now, and honestly it seems like he just hates me. He always comes home yelling, and threatening to hurt me when I‚Äôve done nothing wrong. He doesn‚Äôt go through it that often, but when he does it‚Äôs so scary. I used to look up to him so much, he was my best friend. Then after everything happened, he got into weed and got this friend group and he started changing. I don‚Äôt even recognize him anymore. The rest of my family sided with my mother and is no longer in contact with us at all.

I did make a friend though, like an actual real life friend. The first real one I‚Äôve had in years, and I think I annoyed her to death because she seems so uninterested in talking to me or wanting to do anything. I had this amazing online friend group, they were my reason and I loved them so so much. And then we all just started to drift, they were my only support, the only people I could talk to, and now the only time we message is when I‚Äôm in the middle of a panic attack and desperately need someone to talk to so I message them. They obviously hate me and that makes me want to cry because we used to talk on calls every day.

I‚Äôve dealt with self harm since my father got sick (before he died) because he had convinced me that everything he did to me was deserved and every single little mistake I made, if he wasn‚Äôt there to show that I made it, then I had to. This past year has been so, so horrible. I don‚Äôt want these scars but I can‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs getting so much worse, I‚Äôve been cutting to fat and my brother found one of them and he got so pissed at me. 

Ive had a few attempts, most recent being a couple of months ago. My biggest one was back in November, I took a bottle of fluoxetine, a bottle of Advil, and just a bunch of other pills I mixed together. All it did was fuck up my organs and make my brother apparently hate me even more.

Having constant derealization/depersonalization episodes doesn‚Äôt help either. I used to get them every day, so it‚Äôs not as bad recently, but it‚Äôs definitely still at least a couple times a week. I just want to be normal. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to be terrified of going on walks (which is my favorite thing ever) and thinking a fucking building is melting or I‚Äôm in a dream. Everything is just so scary and I‚Äôve been having so many breakdowns and anxiety/panic attacks and I hate it I hate it I hate myself so much. 

I‚Äôve been starving myself recently as well. I wish I didn‚Äôt have to. I know I‚Äôm anorexic, it‚Äôs painfully obvious (direct quote from my old therapist) I normally go a couple days without food and then eat the bare minimum so I don‚Äôt faint. But I end up doing it anyway, and of course, my brother gets absolutely pissed at that too. Which I mean, understandable, but I‚Äôm trying to stop. It‚Äôs not like I want to count every single calorie I consume and think a godam piece of chicken is too many calories so oh no guess I can‚Äôt have that because it‚Äôll make me go above my 400 calorie limit for the day.

I just can‚Äôt get rid of the thoughts. It‚Äôs every day now I think about suicide. Awhile ago I figured out this whole plan for a ‚Äòpeaceful‚Äô way to do it, and then my dumbass decided to tell my old therapist about it and I got sent away. Every little tiny mistake I make the thought comes back. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good or bad my day was, it always ends with that thought and I don‚Äôt want to keep having to deal with it. I just want it to stop I want everything to go back.

I did start this new antidepressant medication though. I stopped taking my old ones because I heard they can cause weight gain and I was so terrified of that. But of course my idiot self keeps forgetting to take it (yes, I‚Äôve set reminders) 

Honestly I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm even writing all of this. Just to put my thoughts down I guess. Really, all I want is for someone to just check in on me. I‚Äôm not saying I need like 50 people devoting their whole day to seeing how I‚Äôm doing, but just at least one person who cares enough. And not just because I ask them first or bring this up, but because they genuinely want to know. Because they care enough about me to want to know how I‚Äôm feeling. I mean it‚Äôs understandable if people wouldn‚Äôt want to, if I‚Äôm panicking I often send these stupid paragraphs to them and then I regret it after because if someone did that to me j wouldn‚Äôt know how to respond and I‚Äôm just putting them on the spot and then I apologize and I seem like a fucking wimp and I hate I feel so bad.",1

I have lost my baby to a miscarriage and I cannot have a kid due to my parents neglect.
I want to be with my baby. A lot of people in my life recently have died and I too have had a near death experience and it was such a wonderful place on the other side and I don‚Äôt want to be here anymore. 
The only time I was truly happy was carryingng my baby and being dead. I haven‚Äôt felt alive since. 
My parents are fucking abusive druggy children and have made me their mother throughout my up bringing. I basically raised my brother.
I don‚Äôt have friends because I realized people were only friends with me because I‚Äôd do anything for them but when I needed them they were MIA and I only attract people who are narcissists and use me. I cannot seem to make any friends. 
I feel worthless at my job. 
There‚Äôs always something wrong with me. I can never be healthy and it debilitates my life
I don‚Äôt have any money and I cannot get another job for the life of me because my mental health is so bad rn. 
I only have my partner and I know it would ruin him. 
But I‚Äôm tired of suffering. 
Rn I‚Äôm going through drug withdrawals from a fucking medication I was on FOR MY DEPRESSION and now I‚Äôm suffering and my doctors don‚Äôt care. 
I‚Äôm tired of being alone and no one ever caring for me. 
Please. If you think I should stay, I need a reason that isn‚Äôt it‚Äôs going to get better eventually because I‚Äôve been fighting this since I was a teen and it doesn‚Äôt get better. It has NEVER gotten better.

"I've been dealing with very bad suicidal thoughts and tried killing myself through overdose multiple times when i was 10-11.
Now, at 15, after many years of ""the worst thing i can possibly do is kill myself, and life is so worth it"" i feel those thoughts coming back.
A lot of the reason for this is being pushed into lots of drama by people online and being accused of terrible things (that i didn't do)
I have no friends im real life, only online. I have a very supportive family and I'm aware of it but at the same time i feel like I don't like it. My dad has some issues and he scares me, but i feel bad for not loving him.

I feel so alone, and I don't know what the point in seeking connections even is if the people I love the most are going to die.

"a few days ago i had nearly committed suicide but i decided to give life a second chance. why? why didn‚Äôt i just kill myself? i got scammed out of $135  and i really can‚Äôt do this anymore. i saved up, it was one of my motivations. i wanted to buy something ive been wanting for so long and its all gone. i shouldn‚Äôt have given life a second chance. i keep on getting punished. i really will kill myself already. goodbye.",1
i just can't fucking do this anymore. im so tired. i feel so completely alone. it would be easier for everyone if i never existed,1

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I have all the tools to end my life or hurt myself really badly. I am in crisis and I just want the pain to stop.

most helpful thing is key n peele. 

therapy hasn't helped. medication im on seems unhelpful tho many others like it (lamictal). new therapists ask ""what are your goals?"" and I feel...not sure. like... ""feel better and not want to die?"" 

I slept w an attractive woman this week.  id like to see her again she was cheating on a partner so it was just gonna be a one time thing.  at the same time I know I'm more prone to falling apart when I get to know someone so it'd be bound to fail after a month anyway.  

no job and not been able to get myself to act on getting one.  

but yeah...I feel bad. 988 is sometimes a bit helpful for the moment. 741741 as well.

"This is my first and maybe only post here. I'm 34/M. I've been suicidally depressed for many years, but ultimately have admitted to myself that I'll likely never drum up the blistering level of courage it takes to actually follow through. This, ironically, depresses me more than anything. I feel trapped here, unfulfilled and hopeless, because I lack the balls to put a gun to my temple and pull the trigger. 

I spend a lot of time reading and listening to material on suicide, its ethics, testimonials from those affected by it. It's a morbid form of research, but my hope is that I'll eventually find a way to be unafraid, or brave enough in the face of fear to commit. To me, the greatest possible tragedy is continuing on through the length of my natural life, always sad, angry, resentful.

So far, I'm too afraid to buy a gun or the necessary chemicals. But I always knew that if I ever committed, I wouldn't just leave a note. I'd write a small handful of individual letters to my friends and family, apologizing, telling them I love them, trying to explain. I decided to write those letters tonight, and I feel good about it. Like I'm finally doing something. It'll take hours and I'll cry a lot during it, but it's a step that I can take.

Please don't have children. It creates meaning in one's life the way a pyramid scheme creates profit for its owners. You are merely shifting the burden of meaninglessness onto an innocent child. Break the cycle. ",1

I swore myself that I would never kill myself because of a boy but it‚Äôs.. so much more than just the rejection itself.

Or death of some other form. Like a car accident or some kind of tragedy that would spare me from the guilt of doing it myself. I have turned ugly and I don‚Äôt know who I am. I know things in my life are going wrong but I refuse to acknowledge those things because then I know I‚Äôm responsible for talking care of it when I just don‚Äôt care.

"Maybe a ramble - it‚Äôs been pretty bad SI for a while and I‚Äôm getting weaker and weaker. 

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs moronic. Out of spite   But can anyone suggest how to even stop that part or thinking from that way?  It‚Äôs bad enough how much I don‚Äôt want to be living and all the shit that goes with it. And so much self harm and si thinking.

Around her I become someone else - evil. She only cares about what‚Äôs easy and comfortable for her.   She will hang me out to dry or fuck me over no problem.  And later will say all the things - my brain and body are broken from a lot of multiple chronic illnesses and the treatment I receive and the minimizing of how difficult it is for me to keep up or follow her crazy.

I watch her grow as a person an genuinely looks like she is so much happier. Its fucked up but it hurts me. Not because im not happy for her but I am the complete opposite. It would crush me if she saw how I am right now. I spend my weekends binging coke an alcohol an sitting in my room genuinely tweaking. But its the only thing that takes the weight off my shoulders. It also makes my situation so much worst, when using my habits of porn addiction become very dangerous to myself. I dont know how but I got into exposing myself online an sending dommes money.

I make my partner's life harder and I don't know if it would be better to just end things .

"I'm 29, and have been diagnosed with BPD since 2017. So every day is already a mental fight with myself. I recently had to move back in with my mom (and her mom) since living on my own is just too expensive in this economy. I was hesitant since the reason I moved out was her fighting, screaming, and hitting me a few years ago. It started off fine and calm but these past few months have gotten worse like they use to. She claims it's my fault her and her mother fights, that I don't do anything she ask me to do, even though I do, and she snaps back with a ""not without bitching."" She screams at me over the smallest things, screams at the dogs, screams at her mother and it's just too much now at this point. And when she blames me, I rebuttal with ""maybe I should just kill myself"" and she replys back ""maybe you should.""

I have no purpose without them. I loved you D but I can‚Äôt see a life without what you promised to give me. No one else made me feel like you did and to see this was a lie, I can‚Äôt live with myself anymore. 

Today i was going to put a down payment on a home but i will be buying a gun instead. Farewell lonely suicidal people, Im sorry I will no longer be available to help and hear your stories. I‚Äôve been fighting my fight for too long and I am ready to be out of pain. ",1

"life has been shit lately. i thought the low i experienced years ago was already the last, since from childhood up until 12th grade i was miserable in sadness and depression and abuse. but no, life decides to bite my ass once more, this time more painful and more vivid. its a slap to the face saying, ""i was just kidding. i gave you a few moments of relief so i could hurt you way worse the next time."".

are u telling me that sadness and loneliness will forever follow me? fuck that. being born into this family is a fucking curse and i hate myself. i hate my ex for leaving me and i hate my friends for treating me like shit. everything is boring and im barely living, just vaping and drinking painkillers to go through each painful fucking moment. theres no food in the house, no love from my parents, and going to college is a pain in the fucking ass, i dont fucking like anyone there. there's no point in living. all is shit.

"I‚Äôm 19 (trans fem, which is kind of relevant), and I‚Äôve gone through life unhappy, constantly setting arbitrary goals thinking it‚Äôd help, but when I get there it feels the same. Anyways, a couple of weeks ago I tried listening to this singer that I‚Äôd heard a lot about, and I absolutely fell in love with her music. I spent two days straight listening to her stuff, and then I actually looked her up. She‚Äôs beautiful, she started at a young age, and she is unfathomably talented. In the span of a few minutes, all the joy I got from listening to her music melted into misery as I saw, for the first time ever, a life that actually appealed to me, that I knew I would almost certainly never reach, even if I dedicated every second of my life to it from now on. I have no idea why, honestly I‚Äôve never been that jealous of celebrities before but this singer just broke me. I‚Äôve been kind of on the edge for a while, but this stupid thing kind of finished me off. It‚Äôs been over two weeks of sadness and crushing envy now. I‚Äôm just exhausted, I really have to end it.

The funny part is, even if everything lines up perfectly and I somehow become the next big thing in the exact right way by the time I‚Äôm her age, I‚Äôd still feel unhappy. Everything just feels so unfair. Why couldn‚Äôt I have been born as somebody else? Somebody who was the right gender, someone pretty, with a little bit of talent and a family that encouraged her to do what made her happy, not what they could brag about to other rich assholes? It‚Äôs so frustrating that my brain works this way. With the conditions I was born into, I could easily live a well above average life, but that just wouldn‚Äôt be good enough for me, I have to live the exact life of one person out of over 8 billion to even have a remote chance at happiness. 

I just really want to kill myself so I can rest. Either I do it now, wait until the end of my young adulthood crushes the last little bit of my potential, or somehow through some massive series of miracles get to the life I want, realize I‚Äôm still unhappy, and probably kill myself anyways. The only reason I haven‚Äôt slit my wrists already is the delusional belief that there‚Äôs a tiny fraction of a decimal of a percent chance that I could do it with enough practice, money, and luck. Honestly I don‚Äôt see any route that doesn‚Äôt involve my imminent suicide.",1

I know where the blades are kept; I could do it right now if I really wanted to. I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm still here.

"I want to grab all my hiking gear tonight and just fuck off

Damn the consequences with not going to work, I just can't face the onslaught of tomorrow any more even after spending a month out sick this year and using all my leave.

The problem is, if I explain my living and employment situation it sounds normal to good but I have things going on in my life that mean I am taking a step backwards every day. If I am not perfect every single day then I don't get done what I need to and I am falling further into debt with myself. 

I am mentally fucked I can manage my mental health without work and work if my mental health is stable but I can't manage both, one takes priority and it's not me. but I do because that is what you are forced to do if you hide it well enough. I don't know how to explain it to people because they are not like me, they don't deal with this brand of hell where there are no good days.

I am a broken biscuit masquerading as functional. Many people tell me that this is just normal because they arent like me. They dont need to reign in a need to scream, or resist the urge to rip their skin off, tear themselves to peices and hope the doctors put them back together right this time. This is something i actively have to do. I need to reign in a mental breakdown almost every day, sometimes even multiple times a day just to make it to tomorrow.

Today I broke for a second, I blurted out Kill me in front of friends. I briefly cried and gasped and then sobered up because thats what i do, said I was fine and asked them not to worry.  These attacks come out of nowhere, I have done it in front of family twice and at work once.  suicidal spirals that end in me blowing the mask.

Part of me wants to die, the better part of me is saying resign or just run instead. The fact that is my better halfs response should say something",1

"Me: ""I want to do this""

Basically everyone around me: ""No don't do that, it's stupid and dangerous""

Me: (doesn't do anything and his world deteriorates)

There's something wrong with me. One second, I feel fine, I've decided I'm going to keep my job, and go to college. The next, I feel hopeless, and want to run away and do whatever I want.

I can't stand my job anymore. I hate it. It's pointless. I feel like I'm breaking my back over it.

I started meds for anxiety. It helps. And then I forget to take it, and it comes back.

I struggle to take care of myself. My room is a mess. I'm a mess. I forget to take care of myself.

I give into impulses all the time. I decide I'm going to save money, and then I go and make an impulsive purchase, like getting fast food.

I bought a used car. I thought it was a good car from a good dealer. Turned out to have problems. I feel like I wasted a lot of money.

I have no idea who I am. I feel like I want to be myself, but I'm scared of standing out. I tell myself I shouldn't care what people think...but I don't want people to judge me. I don't want attention, so I blend into the background. But apparently I'm supposed to be able to sell myself. I don't how to stand out!

I feel like my existence is wrong. Like I'm a bad person. There's no reason for me to be here. I literally don't even do anything, I just work stupid jobs I hate.

My indecision and procrastination are killing me. Just when I think things are getting better, they're not.

I don't know what to do. I don't know why everyday is so difficult for me.",1

"I am planning on killing myself soon. If it isn‚Äôt today, it will definitely be next week. The pressure of college tuition is too much for me to handle. I am going to an out of state public college that is charging me $7k left over of tuition from $15,000. They expect me to pay it by August 9th &amp; I cannot afford to pay $1400 every month. My loans can‚Äôt even pay for it. My parent cannot afford to get a parent plus loan because they are in default. They encouraged me to go to this college for the experience and left me in the dust once finances came into the conversation. We are not rich at all, in fact, we are damn near poor. I cannot express in words how upset I am for listening to them. I was so excited about going and now I am on the verge of dying.

I‚Äôve applied to plenty of scholarships and my parent acts like I don‚Äôt apply to any because I complain about having to do them. You would complain too if you‚Äôd have to write essays on top of essays and ask for recommendation letters just to not receive anything. Not even a letter confirming that I didn‚Äôt get it. I am currently waiting on a response for 36 scholarships, got denied 7 and only got 2 local ones that add up for $2,000. Even that doesn‚Äôt pay off the amount of money I owe my college. 

Community college is not an option. I told my parent about maybe going there first because I actually cared about debt and they shot it down immediately because they believe community college is only for dummies and that because I was an honor roll student that I should go to my dream college. Them being my parent, I listened to them because the adult is always right, right? I was wrong.

I can no longer live. The amount of stress I deal with almost every day thinking about my tuition is unbelievable. I can‚Äôt live without stressing. Every day is stressful. My job can‚Äôt pay my tuition off. I can‚Äôt live knowing I got kicked out of my dream college for being too poor to pay off my tuition.",1

"I searched for evidence for god or the soul or the supernatural or whatever. I used to be a christian but left due to lack of evidence and problems with the bible and mental gymnastics.

The past 2 months i was on a vigorous search online for arguments and evidence for god. I was studying arguments like TAG, open individualism, ndes, and others but I find them all to be not sound.

So what i feared is here, nihilism. Atheists that dont go here lie to themselves. I cant go back to regular life because i couldnt even fucking find purpose in the first place, thats why i searched for the past few months. No spiritual meaning, just emptiness.

This combined with other shit in my life like porn addiction and ocd makes it a living hell. I was gonna kill myself in april of 2023 but backed out due to being scared and no reliable method to do so.

Fuck this life, its not for me.",1
"Posted this in another sub too but it might be better suited to here:

Honestly I felt so stupid and dramatic writing all this but I‚Äôll post it anyway because idc anymore. 

I‚Äôve been depressed and feeling suicidal for about 3 months now but things have gotten majorly worse in the past couple weeks. I don‚Äôt know how I make it through every day, I‚Äôm so bored and there‚Äôs nothing I enjoy anymore. The only reason I‚Äôve made it until now is my family and my dog. However my family are going on holiday without me in 2 days. This is like the 5th time they‚Äôve done it because I have severe anxiety and I can‚Äôt go with them. This time though, I REALLY need them. I‚Äôve tried expressing what I‚Äôm feeling and had the help of my mental health worker too but they‚Äôre going anyway. My MH worker thinks they should go too and I‚Äôll cope better than I think I will. I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they‚Äôre the only thing keeping me going. And while they‚Äôre away my dog is going to the kennels because I can‚Äôt even look after her by myself. 

I‚Äôve expressed these thoughts mostly to my MH worker who has relayed them to my family but my family don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt tell them these things myself. I‚Äôve told them it‚Äôs very difficult. I‚Äôve expressed the fact I want to die to all of them (MH worker and family) and I felt like they under reacted. Maybe they think I‚Äôm being dramatic and I wouldn‚Äôt actually do anything, which was true up until now but now I‚Äôm in such an awful place I don‚Äôt trust myself not to try to hurt myself or kms. Tonight I self harmed for the first time. I didn‚Äôt do much and am too much of a wimp to be honest but I had an urge to do it. I feel like I‚Äôm a manipulative bitch because it feels like the urge came from me wanting them to see how bad things are. I still have the urge to do more but like I said, I‚Äôm a wimp. Anyway I feel like if I tell my parents, everything will blow up. They get so stressed out about me and I know they need a break but I can‚Äôt survive that right now. I honestly feel so stuck. Dying seems like the only way out. 

I‚Äôve also had intrusive thoughts about hurting other people. Like I said, I don‚Äôt trust myself. I would never do anything like that in my right mind but clearly I‚Äôm not in my right mind right now and I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll go crazy and snap. I genuinely don‚Äôt know what to do. If I don‚Äôt let my family go I feel like they‚Äôll resent me. But it‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs even any way I can make them not go. So therefore suicide seems like the only way out. But nobody believes I would do that. I‚Äôm so stuck. ",1
"I am 18 and about to go to college.  I have had thoughts of ending myself since i started highschool and i even told my mom about it (she encouraged me to do as i wish), i did try overdose but failed. A big part of the reason is school, the admission for medical school is in a few days and i can't focus at all or bring myself to study, I am not ready for it. It is my parents wish. I did communicate with them but they dont seem to understand saying that all the money they wasted on me by food, books will go to waste and that I am lazy. I did try my best but curently I am not in a good mental place, I feel stuck again. I don't have a friend to call right now and I just want to throw away some bad intentions I have at the moment.

"I am currently 28 and have struggled with the darkness and suicidal thoughts since I was 6.. that‚Äôs the earliest snippet of memory in life I have. I thought about jumping out a window. Home was never home. It was abusive.. neglectful and not a very good place. I don‚Äôt have many memories of childhood besides maybe a few short snippets of certain situations. In my teens.. I‚Äôve come to realize I was groomed a lot.. I let older men take advantage of me so that I felt wanted. It was mostly online. But at 17 I let a man SA me and I was happy about it I guess.. he was 30 and I was just happy someone wanted me and liked me. At 18 my first time was not my choice I was held to the ground and then held and was told ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù so I thought it couldn‚Äôt be that if he loves me. Now looking back on the past I‚Äôve seen how much I‚Äôve never had a say in what happened with my partners and I was never asked for consent ever. But I never said no.. I just wanted them to like me. Now I‚Äôm 28, single.. and I‚Äôve been working so hard to heal and heal the generational trauma that was handed down to me. I am the fixer, the healer, the nurturer. So that no one has to ever go through hardships like I did. Now.. now yes I am suicidal daily.. but lately.. well more so recently.. at least 3 months now. I‚Äôve cried myself to sleep, or just don‚Äôt sleep until my body finally gives out.. I am also having health issues, my liver is having issues.. and I have to go get checked for breast cancer as well.. at this point I am feeling very worthless and done. I see no light. I‚Äôm a mom.. my son is the most wonderful soul and being a mom is the best thing to ever happen in my life. I am also currently in college.. but I‚Äôm dropping my classes due to my health and mental stuff. I can‚Äôt keep up with it all, I‚Äôm exhausted. I don‚Äôt have a job.

"I thought it would be tonight. But I'm not ready. Are we ever? I guess the reason is... how do I leave those who love me? Would it be better to just start pushing them away slowly? I'm already in an Isolatative state. My loved ones seem to be fine with that.

My sister is having her first baby and as much as I'm happy and excited to be an aunt, she is moving to another country and doesn't seem to have any plans to have me very involved before she goes. She prefers her SIL who is more IG worthy. I've also been told I won't be blessed as the godmother (even though she is my sons). So, I feel like minimizing contact slowly would be easy.

My mother would be hard but somewhat easy.  She loves me very much but doesn't notice my absence for days. She usually prefers to just talk about herself and interests. Even when she asks for updates or what I'm watching I'm met with ""Anyway..."" almost immediately. 

My son would be the hardest. Since he's 19 and lives with me. But he is at the age where he only wants to focus on his friends. Should I keep encouraging time away from home with his friends and less time with me? He already thinks it's annoying when I ask him to hang out with me. 

My brother barely talks to me just because he's busy doing his own thing. But he's always seemed to have my sister's back more when it comes to us having boy trouble. He was at my sister's side when her ex cheated on her, but when I was raped he didn't even reach out. 

My friends have their own stuff going on and one of my best friends have already benched me in her life after she got married. She had her own new best friend and never includes me in anything. I think she's my best friend and I'm not hers really. My other best friend would be devastated so I think pushing her away would be best?  So it doesn't hurt her as much. She already has so much going on at home. My other close friend... only ever invites our other friend out and never me. She calls me her daughter's chose aunt but wouldn't even introduce me to her. ( I'm really good and safe with kids). She invited me to her daughter's party and seemed disappointed I showed up. She could have been busy with hosting though. So again, slowly disappearing might not be a bad idea. Right? 

I just... I just feel so invisible and worthless. My hobbies I love don't bring any sort of spark. Growing up all my friends abandoned even into adulthood. I've been abused, physically, emotionally, financially and sexually by different partners. I've been told I'm only good enough for one thing in relationships. 

People who are supposed to live have told me I'm too quiet, too pale, too dark, too skinny, too fat, too outspoken, too crazy, too angry, too sensitive, too heartless ""Why aren't you socializing?"" ""God, you were being too flirty? You're such an attention seeker"" 

""What happened to the light in your eyes? It's gone?"" - my sister

Sorry for the rant... I have ADHD ugh! I just want these thoughts to stop haunting my head. 

I can't do this anymore. I just want it to be over. I posted in another sub... but I guess... my main question is... would it be better if I start pushing everyone away? Would it make it easier?",1

But this time ive done more research, I know what method in specific Id like to use and that it would be a high success rate. tonight I started writing suicide notes to all my friends and while writing one of my friends who helped me earlier messaged me. they had said around a week ago their experience with one of their friends committing and It didnt really set in till I was writing how much it would hurt them. I broke down for a while, I hadnt cried that hard in god knows how long. I feel awful, I want to die so bad but I know Id hurt them and all my other friends so much. I feel like such a piece of shit for even thinking about it and I dont know what to do. obviously all of you on here will tell me not to do it, but I dont think I could even though I want to.

I'm a shitty boyfriend because I push her boundaries. Especially during sex. I'm a monster to her. And I don't know why. She's the best thing in my life. She's my shining star. And I hurt her. Again and again and again. She says that I don't respect or love her. That she's just someone to fuck to me. I hate myself. Why did I become this person. Why am I hurting the person that I means so much to me and makes me to happy.

I want it all gone. Everyone would be happier if I disappeared right? My father wouldn't have to pay for me to go through school anymore. My girlfriend is so charming and smart and kind that she'd find someone better woth no problem. 

I know I shouldn't think that I should die. Maybe it's me being cowardly and trying to avoid facing the consequences of my actions. I just don't want her to leave. And I know it's not fair to cling onto her. Or to ask her for forgiveness. I ruined it. I ruined us. And now I'm going to be alone again. And it's my fault. I think it about it more and more lately. I don't know if I'll ever do it. But I'm scared I might. I already started cutting myself a bit. I've never done that before. I'm joining therapy as well. I think I just wanted to write this to get it off my chest.",1
"I can't stop thinking about how it might feel good to not have to go on anymore. It's counter-intuitive because I won't feel ""nothing"", I'll rather ""not feel anything"" so there isn't any reason for me to kill myself but I can't get it out of my head. 

Is there anyway I can get rid of it day to day? I'm trying gardening which, while I don't have thoughts while gardening, it comes back. 

A friend just randomly told me how much I mean to them and I instantly felt insecure or smth like that, I don't feel happy anymore wtf is happening please someone, anything will help",1

"I've never wanted to reach 30. I've always just assumed I'd have offed myself by now. 
In about 5 hours, my 20s are over. 
I've always been terrified of getting older. I don't want to just deteriorate into nothingness. 
I don't want to live out my 30s or 40s or 50s or beyond. 
Life is already miserable for me and I don't see it getting better.

"Ending my life sounds more and more comforting the longer I live. I feel like a walking corpse. I already wrote letters to my family, to my friends to find when I'm gone. I'm looking for ways to get it all done in most dignified way. I feel getting weaker in time when people think I'm becoming stronger and expect me to feel better than the day before. I'm just not it. Not everyone is cut out the same and same things hurt other people different over time. I no longer feel safe talking about my emotions without it becoming huge problem. Trying to live is really just prolonging the suffering I feel inside my head. I know now that talking about it and acting on it wont fix it. It will feel like this for a long time. Im going to therapist, taking pills, talking to friends, learning new things and still I feel worse with each day. Feels like I'm distracting myself at best. Im tired of it all. And want to rest.",1

"Already fed up because I'm lonely. Been dumped in February and I thought I was doing better

I joined clubs, gone swimming,lost a bit of weight, made friends.

But can't find a girl even just for fun. I feel so unloved 


And when I went to my friend's last time in the West, I almost caved in and sniffed cocaine. If it weren't for my female friend telling me ' don't "" I'd have sniffed it.

Instead, I swallowed 900 mg of quetapine (I'm meant to take 600) and had a dozen glasses of alcohol (ouzo, beer, wine...)

It's been a week and I still feel miserable even a few days after my 31st. I try my fucking hardest not to think of my ex and wondering if she's got someone else.

Even my female friend told me she wouldn't get laid easily cause I quote "" she doesn't shave and she's getting old"" (she's 31).

But right now in the middle of the night I keep thinking of killing myself. One reason that's pushing me over the edge is that I've got a DBs.

I threatened on my worst day my headmaster through text (it was a day after the break up and I was having a psychotic episode,
 Still I acted like a douche that day)

I wanna quit being a teacher but I'm worried employers won't hire me because of my DBs.

I feel so lost and when I hear my parents talking to their friends about my current situation I just feel like I should kill myself and restart a new life in another body

Cause yeah I believe in past lives ",1
"I attempted to kill myself three weeks ago. Or it was two? Fuck, I can‚Äôt even keep track of time. Every day is the same.

Every day I ask myself THE question. Should I? Generally the answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù or a vague and lazy ‚Äúyes, but not today‚Äù. But some days‚Ä¶ some days feel more real. 

One day I called a hotline, but another just tried, I just failed, but I genuinely tried and si think nobody cares. No one has asked me why I did it. Maybe not even I know the answer.

But some days there is this true answer to this same constant question. I wish dying were more simple. ",1

Feeling very suicidal. There is just so much hurt and like I don't want to deal with it. I just want it to be over. Not one more day do I want to be alive. I relapsed (sh) 2 days ago after having gone 4 years free. Nobody even knows.,1
"first reddit post and i have no idea what i'm doing, sorry if this is a mess or has typos, but i have no one and nothing else to turn to.

20M, and i barely exist, i have no life in or outside of the house, i have a long distance boyfriend who is great to me and i love him dearly, but i can't fathom putting all of this on him, sometimes he acts in a way that makes me think that my emotions are too much for him, and i can respect that. so, this is truly my only and last choice to talk about this without many limits.  
  
i am unemployed and not schooling at the moment - i've taken a gap year, i was in high school when covid hit and finished my last years from my bedroom, where i have practically been almost every day since for the last three or four years. i am terrified to head into college with all these functional adults, and i've been suicidal since i was eight years old, and i never planned to make it to this age. this all means that i have no idea what to pursue in college, no idea what life i want to try and live. with the rise of AI creatives, i have been completely displaced in my (former) dreams of pursuing something artistic, though i'm fully aware that art hardly makes money, and that my skill does not exceed anyone's - i bring nothing to the table to make me worth looking at over AI anyway. 

as previous stated, i am essentially bed-bound - i've been trying to make more plans to get out of the house, but i can't drive and must rely on my only friend to come pick me up to get me from point A to point B, i do not make any money to pay back the gas that they spend, i am a burden and quite useless in this regard, and it fuels my idea that everyone in my life would be much better without me leeching off of them.

some issues that don't need much elaboration is that: i am overweight, i likely have PCOS (and may have possible fertility issues, i never wanted kids but to have the ability deprived from me when my body is already useless makes me so upset), i am a person of color, i am not very likable, i am unattractive, apart of the lgbtq+ community, i'm not very smart, i haven't achieved anything, i am a financial burden, an emotional burden, all of my hobbies that could potentially generate income - i am mediocre/subpar at, i struggle with a porn and masturbation addiction that i feel horrific about, through all of this, i have come to realize that i have *no* redeeming qualities that make me worth taking up the space that i do. i've tried accepting this fact, but i absolutely can't, because i am surrounded by people and social media that constantly reminds me that the people around me are so much better.

all this said, as a very brief **tl;dr, i have no redeeming qualities to make up for the space that i take up and for the burden that i am, and it's eating away at me.**

i'm still learning how to be an adult, like everyone my age, but *worse*, because i am horrifically behind the curve, with parents that coddle(d) me into adulthood, i am overly reliant and can only front for non-family to make it seem like i have my shit together, when i clearly don't. i think that at 20, i've definitely hit the limit for being like this and i feel the need to relieve everyone.",1
And I feel worse.,1
"I'm getting worse and worse at everything I do. I haven't had a job for over a month. I keep hitting shit with my car when I never used to. The idea of death has been ever-present and comforting for a long time now. The hardest thing to argue with is that it would be better for other people. If I'm going to keep fucking up this badly and not contributing to this world, and I'm not even enjoying myself, then what the fuck am I doing here? I do understand it would be traumatic for those around me, but I don't exactly have a huge circle and it seems like the net negative i contribute would at least be put to an end if I wasn't around. However as a biological organism I am scared to die. It sucks that the main thing keeping me here is my own cowardice, although I do respect human life and think it's bad to take it for an objectively small reason. But it doesn't feel small to me. If I had a gun I would already be gone. ",1
Been watching a bunch of jumping videos on websites and as scary as it looks I still want to do it. I can‚Äôt get it out my mind. I want to die so bad but I don‚Äôt have the guts to shoot myself with my parent‚Äôs gun. I could so easily get it but I rather die away from home so they won‚Äôt have to walk in and see me.

"i made up my mind in march, im 25 i just lost my job, my car just got repoed and my wife left me in january and is now inlove with another man.

I dont know who i am anymore. Its been an ugly seperation with her, with her getting arrested for domestic battery, with her telling me if i killed myself she wouldnt care. Telling me im worthless and useless. Ive been dreaming of the end since i was 15. I have nothing. I sit everyday and i try i try to do evrything right and im trying to find a job and im really trying not to give up. but tonight when my wifes boyfriend blamed me for him cheating on the girl he was with and i told her hes been sleeping with my wife...and its my fault and he deadnamed me and threaten to come and kill me...SHE laughed in my face and left me alone in this house to be with a man who has been playing her. I feel like i was left for the dead. My heart is aching, my soul is crushed. She doesnt love me anymore and i keep pretending she does. She just looks at me in the face and tells me she doesnt love me, she only cuddles with me because im a place holder. I let this woman destroy me. I let her kill me. She tells me she cares and she loves me but switvhes so quick. I hope september comes faster. I hope my suffering ends. I'm ready. ",1
"I know they say at the end of the day YOU have to put the work in to get better, but what's the point of getting better alone? I'll still be alone. I'll still have no one to support me when things get tough again or to cheer on my accomplishments. 

I need someone to come and save me, to take a strong an suddenly interest in my wellbeing. To hold me when I'm having a breakdown and to bring me a bite to eat when I haven't left my bed all day. Someone to pet me and get me to go on a walk with them. Someone to laughing with at stupid things, Someone for me to help as well.

But I don't have that person. I don't have friends, at least none that close. I'm alone. Just me and my cats. I also take help take care of my grandparents that live close by. My mother is in another country, she's dying as well. 

So either someone appears tomorrow and rescues me, or i will do the barely minimum to live, i will take care of those who need me, then the second they are all buried and dead, I will kill myself. 

It's not even up for discussion anymore. Therapy is helpful when you have people around you. Otherwise it's an hour of contact just to be dumped back into isolation right afterwards.

"i dont know why im putting this here and ill probably regret even saying it but every single time im alone with my thoughts i spiral into this weird mess of paranoia and self deprecation and convince myself everyone fucking hates me until i have one conversation with someone i consider a friend and i'm alright again. every time it gets past 9pm almost without fail unless i occupy every sense with some kind of distraction i start thinking about what it would be like if i wasnt here at all. i dont intend to stick to this anymore but last week i gave myself an ultimatum, that if i go on holiday with a friend like i plan to and come back and still feel like this, i don't have to keep going. it didn't scare me it just felt comforting. the idea that i can just do that. i seem to be getting into a pattern of fully intending on making a plan and then feeling awful about it the next morning. sometimes. sometimes i just dont feel anything either way about it. but i dont have the nerve to act on it. i dont even think i really want to. i'm also trans ftm with an unsupportive family and ive essentially promised myself that if i never get access to hormones i will kill myself. i dont know if this even counts as being suicidal but i havent said anything to anyone about it. i have maybe two friends im close enough to to talk about something like this, one of them was actively suicidal not that long ago and i don't want to trigger him in any way because im too scared of losing him. the other i dont want to burden with that",1

It is so frustrating to have so many health issues and be told to see a doctor. Every doctor I visit over the years told me there is nothing they can do and told me to go away.

My wife of 18 years just recently decided that she no longer wants to be married to me. She blames me for everything that is wrong in her life and the reason she isn‚Äôt happy. I was not a great husband and a few years ago had a sexting affair with another woman while I was having a midlife crisis after a heart attack. It only lasted about a month and when the wife saw my texts it was a very bad time for over a year. She and I worked through things or so I thought and recently I found texts between her and another man. I am so tired and I love her with all my heart. But I feel that she would be happier if I was dead. Have a pistol at home and I think today may be the day I give her the wish of me being gone,1

You sliced deep, stinging  
Painful cuts  
Only you could have cut me the way you did...  
In the deepest, most painful way...

the scars... I reopen them...

I want to hug you...

they are a reminder...  
What did you want me to remember...?  
Why did you cut me so...  
So deep...?

Letting my walls down...

"I'm 29 years old and have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. The past year has been the worst it's ever been, living on autopilot, getting no joy out of almost everything, thoughts of dying daily. The one thing that would always keep me going was my wonderful girlfriend. Without her I'm not sure I'd be here today. Just being with her was enough to keep me going, she was the one thing that never failed to make me happy. I never shared any of this with her. I was so afraid of losing her if she saw how truly broken I am. The past year has been so rough, I know I haven't been the partner she deserves. I've felt so numb, stagnant, so tired and despite my efforts to hide these things they've bled through into my life. Making me into someone I wish I wasn't. She deserves so much more than that. She left me two days ago and I am completely broken. I was barely holding on before but now I don't know if I can. I let my depression take away the one good thing in my life. I'm so afraid to die, I don't think there's anything after this. I don't want it to hurt. I'm too scared to do it but I don't want to be alive.

"Hi friends. I know how stupid it sounds, but the title pretty much sums it up. I apologize that this also kind of gets a bit ramble-y. My mind is really racing atm. But thank you so much for even just deciding to read any of it, being noticed really means a lot. I will do my best to monitor this post and reply to anyone, but this is a throwaway account so bear with me if im slow.

I‚Äôm a 17 year old female surrounded by a friend group full of talented artists. For years I have struggled with this feeling of worthlessness because I lack any real talents. Everything in my life seems to revolve around art, and it kills me that im incapable of creating anything im proud of. My friends and I are sort of nerdy and really enjoy making characters and plots and stories together‚Ä¶ but it pains me so much that I cannot put what is in my imagination onto paper or tablet. All of my friends get so much joy out of spending time drawing, and I just wish I had that. I am constantly whining and complaining about how bored I am and how much I wish I had a hobby. I have been doodling from time to time since such a young age and even after all these years I have never gotten better. ‚ÄúPractice makes perfect‚Äù is one of the biggest lies I have ever heard. Some people just have a natural talent. Yes, practice is important‚Ä¶ but it just doesn‚Äôt help if you don‚Äôt have the initial spark. I‚Äôve tried so hard, I really really have, but any time I try to bring myself to try again, all I want to do is break down crying. All I can do is compare myself to my friends. I know how dumb it is, but I am genuinely considering killing myself just because I have no artistic talent.. it‚Äôs all I‚Äôve ever wanted in life and it‚Äôs simply not doable. All I want is to be able to fill my mundane life with something that makes me happy. Something that brings me even the smallest bit of joy. But I can‚Äôt. I‚Äôm simply not good enough, and never will be. I don‚Äôt know where to go from here. I don‚Äôt want to die, but I don‚Äôt want to keep living so miserably. This is maybe the closest I have ever been to ending it once and for all. I have never previously attempted, but have had police show up at my house to do a welfare check in the past. I wasn‚Äôt necessarily planning anything, but I was definitely in a rough mindset. Im just too afraid to really try, and don‚Äôt want to hurt my friends and family, as well as my boyfriend (who also heavily struggles with mental health) because he has told me so many times that he would kill himself if he ever lost me to suicide. I don‚Äôt want to rip two families to shreds just because of me‚Ä¶

TL;DR: Surrounded by people more talented than me, constantly brought down by my lack of talent. All I‚Äôve ever wanted is to be able to draw, but im simply not good enough for it. I just want to be able to do something that will make me happy because my life is so mundane feeling.

"I‚Äôve always been a sad person, I see pictures of me crying from when I was younger over stupid shit.

I feel like I‚Äôm not human, like a parasite that infected the human vessel i am and am controlling it (very poorly at that). I don‚Äôt think I was meant to be born, or be a human at all. I am simply not fit to live. I cant function normally, I can‚Äôt talk to people without driving them away because I make everything uncomfortable or annoying. I cant even walk because it hurts so fucking much, I‚Äôm a failure of a person. I‚Äôm so stressed out I have so much to do and I know I‚Äôm going to fuck everything up, and disappoint everyone like I always do. I don‚Äôt know how to stop this, I‚Äôve tried multiple medications but they just make me want to fucking shoot myself. 

I‚Äôm a horrible person on top of that, like I couldn‚Äôt get worse. I never text my loved ones, I never call.

"What should i do if my bf got strong suicidal attempt?

I‚Äôve been dating him for a while and things always go fast and smooth between us, i can say everything is going quite well so far, and we just past the first month of our relationship.

Technically speaking, he‚Äôs the very first serious partner in my life and i cherish this relationship a lot, we love each other a lot too.

He told me from the start that he got some mental issues, so yes he has drug problems but nothing like addict, i know it can relieve him sometimes but i hope i can help him to gradually quit this.

At first, he always said things to me like ‚Äúbaby u are legit the only reason that i wouldn‚Äôt kill myself‚Äù or ‚Äúi wanna try to quit drugs for u‚Äù, i was quite touched and motivated, i sort of wanted to *save* him, i know it‚Äôs stupid though but i still feel like so.

A big problem in this relationship is that, most of the time we have to do long distance, his hometown is close to me but not where he does uni right now.

So last time when we saw each other, we spent 4 days together, there was this night where everything was so good, vibe was alright, until he told me maybe we need to face reality of long distanceand other things.

I‚Äôve always been an insecure person and when he kept emphasizing *reality* i bursted out crying and i ended up crying for almost an hour, out of breath. But he was too, there was this moment that he can‚Äôt help himself so he escaped to the bathroom just so i wouldn‚Äôt see him crying out loud. But i did hear it, of how he was out of breath like me.

From this i know at least we really love each other and i also told him that i really want us to work out.

But today, he texted him quite a bit less than before so i asked him if everything‚Äôs alright, he said he‚Äôs hungover and tired. And he said he‚Äôs worried about me, for being too attached to him that if one day he leaves me i‚Äôd be too traumatized and even ruin my own life. So he‚Äôs trying to let me withdraw. He also said things like he think he would *eventually kill himself* because of all those issues, and they are getting worse every year and he doesn‚Äôt know if he can handle it.

I cried again, but instead this time i couldn‚Äôt cry in his arms and feel his firm hugs, and everything of this relationship suddenly feels like time bomb right now.

I feel so sad thinking about all these beautiful things have barely started but i already have to prepare to be losing them, it really breaks my heart.

I tried to put myself into his shoes, i know i can‚Äôt help him because it‚Äôs actually not about me but himself. He does love me, so he wants me to be less sad if bad things really happen one day.

I really don‚Äôt know what to do right now. Unlike other crisis, this one makes me feel really weak, and my heart hurts everytime just by thinking about it.

All i ask for right now, is that he can live on long as he can, even if he loves someone else after me, even if we couldn‚Äôt be together.

Btw, at this moment, i am still waiting for his good night. Please.",1

"Sorry if my english is not good, I‚Äôm european. I don't usually write personal things on Reddit but I really need to get this out because I have no one.

I was with my ex for 4 years, until February this year. I'm 28 (almost 29) and she's 32. These 4 years we always had a good time and we did a lot of things together. We shared a lot of interests: anime, video games, love of animals, volleyball. We attended the same volleyball team and over the course of these 4 years her friends also became mine; I have never had many friends, in fact practically none, whereas with them I had found a group of emotionally intelligent, funny people with whom, together with her, we met to role-play every weekend. 

Then in the last year the situation started to go badly.
For a variety of reasons related to our respective situations at home, she no longer came to my house, and I no longer went to her house. Specifically, I no longer went to her house because her retired mother was always there smoking and we didn't have a shred of privacy, she didn't come to me because my house was always either too cold in the winter or too hot in the winter. summer, because while studying at university I didn't have the money to pay the heating or air conditioning bills.

The problem was that she simply seemed to have accepted the fact that we could only see each other once a week, on the weekend, and only with our (her) friends. The more I asked for a solution to be able to carve out time for ourselves too, the more she told me that, due to the situation at our homes, this was not possible. Punctually when I brought up this topic we argued, because I seemed insistent, and it seemed absurd to me that she considered a relationship based only on this.

Sex was gone.
We went from doing it less and less, to doing it once every month and a half/two, until we didn't do it anymore from June last year until November. 

She just didn't seem to feel the need to spend time alone with me. We saw each other either at volleyball, or with her friends.

In November last year, after yet another argument, we took a break, in which we continued to see each other only as friends doing the usual things, that is, seeing each other at volleyball and on Saturday evenings at our friends' house.
During this break I thought a lot about the situation, and I was ready to change to start again for the better, but in February she instead told me that she no longer wanted to continue, and that if I wanted at most we could just remain friends, because being together as a couple it made her feel bad.

This thing literally broke me open and made me a non-functioning human being.

I loved this girl and I still love her, I wanted to build a life and have children together.

I left the volleyball team and the group of friends because hearing or seeing her again made me feel too bad, so now I'm completely alone. 
I have no friends, I have no family, I have no girlfriend, I have nothing. 
I see a psychologist every two weeks but it isn't helping me at all. 

Since February I have done nothing but work, come home and stay in bed, I no longer function as a human being. All I do is think about what I could have done better to prevent her from leaving me. I'm eating out of regulation and staying in bed all day. I finish work (remote work), I throw myself into bed, stare at the PC until late at night and start a new day like this, uninterruptedly, since February.
At almost 30 years old I feel completely finished.

Yesterday I indirectly discovered that she is seeing another person.

"I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

My partner also gets frustrated when they have the baby and the baby cries or can‚Äôt settle. I‚Äôve explained that this is just the baby right now and we have to take the good with the bad. 
I finally asked my partner what I could do to make things easier or better, because I cannot handle walking on eggshells when they won‚Äôt communicate with me. My partner said that it sounds like I want it to end because I do everything and they do nothing. I never said that and I never said I wanted it to end, but that is their go to Everytime I try to voice a concern. 

I have no money of my own, the house is mine but I couldn‚Äôt afford the mortgage alone right now, let alone the rest of the bills and stuff for my child. 

If this ends, I will have my partner take the baby to their family‚Äôs to visit and I will kill myself. It seems like the easiest solution and then I‚Äôd be out of this misery. I love my child but I cannot live life like this. I just want it all to end. 

I‚Äôm sorry, I know this is a jumbled mess, I‚Äôm just at a loss. I feel helpless and hopeless. ",1
"No body really cares. I don‚Äôt even care. I‚Äôm so fed up with the world and this generation and how normalized it is to cheat, to hurt someone you said you loved dearly, pushing people down for their feelings..

"I been having this rocky relationship with my former partner and everytime we fight there‚Äôs this line of he just wanting to leave and me clinging to talk about it. I suffer from ptsd and is a big chunk of my life. I was abused from an early age and my abuser and I had a really horrible dynamic in which always he would threaten me to leave. And in the end that was the kindest thing he ever did to me. Fast forward my former partner J(25) he always break down in middle of fights saying how much I am a nightmare I am abusing him and all, everytime I complain about being canceled last minute or planning changing or anything like that.
Yesterday the fight was so big he in the heat of the moment he was begging me once more to leave, and then said ‚ÄúI dream of a world without you in it‚Äù my world shattered there was smth that clicked right away. I‚Äôm F(27) and I‚Äôve been planning my dead for so long and I think those were the words I needed to hear, to finally do it. I‚Äôm writing letters and feeling better now that I know that I‚Äôm finally going to do it. Me too wish for a world without me in it. 
I would have loved to experience love longer
Or have a family and live the experience most people with healthy brain does.

Everything that could go wrong in my life went wrong. If I had to just count all the negative things that are constantly happening to me at this point I wouldn't be able to. Yet I can't recall even a dozen good things that happened to me in the last several years. And all of this not even being my fault. I was just born and still always in the wrong place at the wrong time. I don't know why I deserved this but maybe some people just gotta get fucked to balance the universe and I'm one of them sadly. Anyway by the end of this month I'm gonna be completely out of money so won't be able to pay for rent and there is no escape this time, I don't have friends, my dad is disabled, my mom lost her job because of the w@r, I literally have no one to depend on so I guess now it doesn't even matter whether I want to live or not, I'm dying either way.

He screamed not to talk to him and that he never wants my help so i went to the toilet and stating beating my head againdt the wall then I went to my room and started to best my arms with my shoe, then I lied down on the floor and cried for a bit. My mum doesn‚Äôt love me, I can feel it that she knows Im not religious subconsciousky and fucking hates me  for it, and I have no friends. nobody knows me, and nobody likes me not even my family.

"I'm trans and live in the US. After what happened the other day I no longer believe anyone will beat Trump, he just managed to become the martyr of his cause while also surviving the process. 

If he gets elected odds are, best case scenario, i lose HRT and wind up forced to detransition, at which point I know I'll kill myself because the dysphoria would be too much. Ive been there before, before I transitioned, and transitioning is the only reason I survived. 

Or what he has planned is worse and something worse will happen to me. I don't want to be tortured by his rabid cult. I'm already worried I'll be hate crimed if I leave the house. 

I have people trying to get me out of the red state I live in, but I'm worried something, anything will go wrong. And even then, getting to a blue state is different entirely than moving to a different country. We're poor, I can't work due to mental disability. I'm pretty sure we're stuck here. 

So I'm pretty sure I could save myself a lot of pain by killing myself sometime before Trump is elected. At least then I could die on my own terms.

"I \[27F\] have been no-contact with my family for four years. There is not a single person in my family (not even a distant cousin) who I talk to. I also have no friends because I have social anxiety and come off as cold/distant. I have tried to make friends many times with little success. 

My depression and longing to be desired has gotten to a point where I've started going to bars alone and hooking up with random men. I started doing this two months ago and have slept with three people. 

Today, I had to go get an STD test because I have been having symptoms of herpes. I don't have my results back yet but I am 99% sure I have it. 

I feel like a waste of space and as if my life has no purpose. My family wants nothing to do with me, nobody wants to be my friend, and I don't bring anything positive to this planet. I am a stupid, diseased slut. 

My last hope was finding a relationship, but I've pretty much blown that by catching this disease. My dating pool has been reduced by 90%. All because I was depressed which led me to make stupid, impulsive decisions. 

What's the point of living? I have nobody and now I have no dating prospects. I want to quit my job, isolate myself, and peacefully end my life. ",1

"i'm going to be 32 in february which in itself is a huge achievement; when i was a teenager i never thought i'd live past it-and i might have been right. i've taken most of the people in my life for granted because i was so swept up in trying to cultivate this image that i was doing better than i actually was, and a person that people would like rather than be the person i am. i tried to forgive and forget the child torture i was forced to endure living with my mother who isolated me from everyone and everything, had her friends monitoring the house while i was stuck there alone five days out of the week, until eventually i was old enough to ""take care of myself"" which seemed to make her think that was permission for her to only show up at the house two to five days out of the month. i was never taught discipline. i was never exposed to social environments so i've always struggled with etiquette. i was never shown how to believe in myself, or accept love, or that i was capable of success. i've always been treated like i'm just wrong, body soul and mind. i ruin everything. im a plague. i dont deserve anything good because i'm always wrong and i always fuck everything up. i've never been able to break through the abuse, and i've never had a single therapist who was proficient enough in their art to actually give me the help i need, because i cant afford good insurance that would pay for a more efficient practitioner. and i wont even try. i to my core, don't believe i deserve the help, or to live happily. i can't break the cycle. i was sexually trafficked as a toddler with several other children and recorded as i was assaulted. i've told nobody that mattered this.

my mother and i got into a heated argument a year ago where i held her accountable for some of the things she did, and we didn't speak for five months after. imagine how shocked i was when she texted me threatening to call the cops if i didn't return the guns and silver i ""stole"" after breaking into her apartment (understand i don't drive bc of disabilities and she lives very far away; i take two trains and a bus to get to her place - not to mention i'm agoraphobic ?? it takes a two day pep talk just to convince me it's safe to go to the store across the street from my apartment), and then when i refuted the accusation she said "" yea you probably already sold it all already so nvm "" and then proceeded to tell the family that she SUSPECTS i did these things. if i was to break into her apartment to take anything, it would've been to take the fucking dog. now the family won't tell me where my dementia addled grandmother has been moved to bc they think i'm some kind of drug addicted arms dealer. there's no words for the shock and grief that's subdued me. she's always been a horrible mother and person, and yet i'm in agony over this. i've been grieving the loss of something i never even had for over a year, and all my will is just...gone. i can't hold down a job and i don't care. i'm gaining a lot of weight, and i don't care. i'm isolating and can't get out of bed anymore, and i just don't fucking care at all. all the work i put in when i was in my twenties to give myself some sort of reprieve (ie medications to keep me straight, a modicum of work ethic to keep a roof over my head, maintaining a healthy diet and routine) i've demolished in a state of apathy and self sabotage. there's no joy in being alive when i can't pick myself up. i need help with everything, and i have no one. i don't even want to try. i'm inclined to ask my roommate to remove her shotgun from the home, but i've seen that outcome, and i don't want that to be the last thing she sees of me, and i don't want to leave the dogs scared and confused, and traumatized.

i can't afford to flee the country, and i desperately need to because it's trying to kill me. i have no support systems. i can't stop grieving. i'm crying every day. i don't want to do it anymore. there's no future. it's not worth it. i don't want to get up anymore. there's nothing to get up for. i'm angry and mean all the time. i've never been a good person and i cannot change no matter how hard i try. i wish i was dead.",1

"I (15 year old female) have been feeling this way for a while now. I‚Äôve been struggling with my toxic mental health for a long time now and nobody around me seems to care about me at all.

The first time I ran away that night I had a knife with me but, I wasn‚Äôt fast enough and they caught up to me and forced me to go back home. They didn‚Äôt even care about me they just said I was ‚Äúmaking a scene.‚Äù The second time I ran away I couldn‚Äôt take a knife with me cause my parents prevented me from getting to the draw with the knives in it so I left without one. My plan that time was to just keep running until I found another way I could end my life like jumping into the canal and drowning myself. Well, long story short I got brought back home that time too cause the police were called. It was strange tho cause I didn‚Äôt feel scared or worried about getting in trouble with the police when I had to talk to them I felt comforted like I was finally being listened to. I felt attracted to the policeman that was talking to me like he was the first man in my life to ever be a good man to me. It was amazing. But, he left eventually and the feeling I had left with him it was so disappointing. But, I‚Äôm not gonna mess up this time. I‚Äôm planning to run away again very soon not sure when but I‚Äôll figure it out soon. Except, this time I‚Äôm gonna take my mum‚Äôs car instead of running.

"TW: SA, CSA

Hii im \[20, F\] actually thinking about commiting bcs i feel my life has come to the point where i cannot keep going. Ill explain, i had an extremely sad and rough life which has caused me trauma and personality disorders such as bpd. I was s3xually abus3d as a child (cocsa) and as a teenager by older teenagers. This led to several identity issues for me with my sexuality. i became fixated on sex by age 6, which only made my situation worse as i would try to have sex with people and the only people who would have me were pdf files.  I became exposed to pdf files and pdf file p0rn by some of my abusers by age 13. my mouth was r4ped at that age and i developed an oral fixation. I became addicted to smoking cigarettes and marijuana, also took a bunch of drugs and acohol during my teenage years, as one does, and i developed an addiction to benzos. i started to sell pics of myself to pay for my addiction. This benzo addiction kept going until i was 18 and my family sent me to rehab. I recovered and had to be put on medication for my issues. abilify and prozac, i take them to this day. I also had an ED during my adolescence and self harm issues. I am now recovered but i ache greatly as i want to feel how i felt before, i felt alive. I have gained like 40 kgs since my ed and i wish i could go back to how my body was since i no longer find myself cute or fuckable. i dont go outside anymore, i dont have ‚Äúfriends‚Äú to ‚Äúhang out with‚Äù, i have a psychiatrist and psychologist but nobody else to talk to. I only stay at home and play online (Dont have online friends either). I am extremely unbearable in relationships so nobody will put up with me, i am also ugly so its hard enough. should i just off myself as i am clearly in for a long life of suffering? My memory will not cease and i cannot forget how good having friends and taking drugs felt, or how greatly being loved by someone feels like. i still havent finished school yet because im a loser who failed chemestry and its been years since. should i just kms? I cant deal with all of this

"Why do I wake up every single morning with suicidal ideations? They used to last me all almost of the day and not go away no matter what I tried to do. Now it only seems to be when I wake up and then it seems to progress through the day, it just seems to disappear and then I don't usually have issues anymore for the rest of the day. Some days though, it still would come and stay throughout the day and or go away and then come back later as well.

Then with my sleeping, even if I sleep 7 or 8 hours, I still wake up tired. Most of the time I wake up extremely tired and fatigued like I haven't slept.

I've also tried going to the hospital several times and there's been issues when I've went there (if you would like to know what happened feel free to ask and I'll tell you). I also went inpatient at the mental ward part of the hospital back in February of this year, but I ended up not getting any help in some issues occurred while I was there (if you would like to know what happened, feel free to ask and I'll tell you).

"I dont feel like i deserve the gift of life . Basically, i got with this girl, which was my my mates ex, breaking bro code. I did so bc of a mixture of loving her as a person, greed for my own self, and the fact i felt sorry for her as his ex allgedly violated her(not true and it fucked me over, you'll find out soon). It was smooth sailing for the first week, chill, no drama, but since the group found out abt us being together, they aint happy. As a result I pressured her to let me expose him of his alleged crime to the group. They called cap, kicked us out. She got very upset, so much so that on our date, i had to stop her from scratching herself (self-harm) because of it. I thought i was in the right all this time, even kids helpline said it was violation. Keep in mind she has past trauma, and she had not been shaking and being this stressed since it. 

She then called the cops and they said it wasn't S/A, for a valid reason which both of us had overlooked. We then apologised to the group, and she left me on her own accord, which i accepted. Not only have i caused her to legit stress about this, making her want to disappear (she is moving schools bc of this), but ive almost caused the mate i stole her girl from to commit suicide, as i yelled at him with not very nice language abt this when confronting him, threatening to blackmail him and mentally tortured him. Sure the last bit was my fault; the group hates me and her now. I feel that it was all 100% my fault, even though i was only trying to pass the message on. Ive caused her and her ex emotional damages beyond my comprehension. 

Ive had a panic attack about this too. This is not the only incident i have hurt people, as i used violence alot, bullied, and was an overall dick to alot of people last year. I thought this one i was gonna change, but ive only repeated my mistakes, and my reputation at school was already bad enough, but now i'd rather rot at home and learn nothing than have to deal with all this.

"i said it. therapy truly changed my life for the better but making an effort everyday to stay sober, to apply healthy coping strategies in order to keep myself away from harm &amp; suicide  is so exhausting. one day i feel validated in my career, feeling invincible, on top of the world and the other i feel like i dislike everything around me and dislike everything in my life and want to end it all. i‚Äôm tired tired tired tired. i‚Äôm jealous of healthy people with no mental health issues, i‚Äôm so jealous because what do you mean your brain just works properly and gives you the opportunity to be happy? You know what my brain does? It goes to the extremes of happiness for a couple hours, days max and then goes to the extreme of despair for days and hours. i‚Äôm trying to remind myself that this is temporary, everything is. but having to live that cycle every couple of days is exhausting. i‚Äôm so angry at life for making us suffer like this.

"i know someone if not all of y‚Äôall will tell me to just leave and be done with it but i cannot physically bring myself to do that yet so please, please don‚Äôt. ‚Äúi know you said not to but you gotta leave‚Äù no i don‚Äôt want to hear that i just want to know that i‚Äôm not insane right now without being pressured into doing something like that, maybe i‚Äôll be able to leave on my own.

that being said, my relationship with my SO is great, i love him a lot, he‚Äôs usually affectionate and appreciative of me.

but then he gets in these moods. he‚Äôs got depression that tends to come and go. when he‚Äôs depressed he blames me for every problem that HE caused in our relationship.

he cheated on me (if you can call it that, he stayed texting random bitches who live across the country from us) ‚Ä¶ we fought a LOT about it but stayed together. he‚Äôs shown me he‚Äôs sorry, and he‚Äôs the one who came out and told me about it on his own. i didn‚Äôt find it or nothing.

his problem with all that though is that i was ‚Äúso angry‚Äù and when he‚Äôs depressed he says he thinks about it and can‚Äôt let it go. i understand that, i slapped him as hard as i could across the face. but fuck man, how would you respond?

oh, and the fact that his mom and family found out about this and hate ME??? not for the slap, i don‚Äôt know if they even know about it. because i was so angry at him even though i stayed with him. i was angry so i said a lot of hurtful shit. i get that. i fucked up.

but he always acts like we‚Äôre past it when he‚Äôs happy. couples go through shit, right?

i really have no purpose if not for him. all i do it work, cook food for him (i‚Äôve realized that‚Äôs my love language) and try and help him with his dream career. he works a more physical job while working on his career on the side. the only chore i ask him to do is the dishes. we both are working now to save up money, he said once i‚Äôm pregnant and i can stop working if i want and he‚Äôll provide. i‚Äôm happy with that.

but right now he‚Äôs in one of those depressed moods. and i‚Äôm feeling it right now too. more than normal. i know this will pass like every other time. but i‚Äôm so tired, man‚Ä¶

Ever since 2020 I've felt more and more disconnected from society and people at school especially after what happened at home where my dad beat my mom. I feel so guilty for only making things worse for my mom and being against her instead of with her while she was being abused by my father. I feel like I've been an asshole to everyone who's ever tried to help me and I feel like sometimes I just bring misery into this world. I feel spurts of productivity sometimes but then I feel really depressed and alone. I just want someone who I feel like I can open up to and love. I just don't know if I can go to my mom as I don't feel comfortable opening up to her and I genuinely think that her life would've been better if she never met my dad and thus never had me. I've done so many awful things and I think that maybe I'm just a bad guy. I wish I was never born so then I nobody would be hurt from me and I wouldn't feel this hurt. I feel like I've caused so much pain to my mom and I just want her to be happy. I feel empty a lot of the time and things don't fulfill me like they used to. I'm not sure if things will ever get better sometimes because sometimes it feels like life is going in a loop. I feel so betrayed by my father because I loved him so much but he just kept abusing me and my mother and it hurts so much to think about how he never really loved me even though I loved him. Sometimes I envy my sister because she never had to live through any of this since she died at birth. I'm always too scared to kill myself and sometimes I feel better so it makes me hopeful but then it fluctuates a lot. I listen to ASMR sometimes but then it's just so empty when the video ends and nobody is there anymore. Thank you for reading my vent and I hope everyone here has a better life one day. Peace.,1
"How do you tell everyone around you that you‚Äôre terminal? I have everything planned. I am going to make sure I am at peace this time. Nobody knows at all.

I will be 35 this year on my birthday. I feel like I‚Äôm drowning and I‚Äôm exhausted. I just can‚Äôt fight anymore. It felt good knowing I had a date planned.

"I'm done. I don't want to do this anymore, lol. I can't control my emotions, I don't have a grip on life, motivation (what is that?,) I don't want to physically talk to anyone about it, I just want to be gone. I don't know. I'm not particularly sad about anything, nor am I angry anymore. Like many of you, I've been through hell too and I used to cry for hours and pity myself about everything. I was disgusted in myself and my family for many yucky reasons but now.. it's like there's nothing? 

I have no desire to work, eat or actually LIVE, you know? I've been passively suicidal for about 7 years, going on 8 years in roughly a month and I'd usually cry, think about dying, maybe some SH and then I'd go to bed but tonight.. somethings different. I literally just had a cry but it only lasted like 5mins or so and now I'm completely neutral.  I still do not want to be alive but I don't have the overhelming urge to jump off a building or drive my car into the gas lines. I think I'm just.. done.. I don't feel anything?????

"People always tell me to keep living this, and don't kill yourself that, but honestly, for what? I'm gonna die anyway. We're living in a world that's run by hatred, evil, and selfishness. I don't really want to live in a world like that. I often find myself pondering about my life, thinking to myself, is there really a point to continue living? Even if I get what I want, how long will I stay satisfied? Whenever I'm having fun, eventually it ends. Whenever I'm relaxing or chilling out, eventually it ends. Everything is temporary, and honestly it's just really boring. Even the few things that still excite me to this day have a weaker effect on me than it did years ago. Maybe it's because my life's just been on a downwards spiral ever since I graduated high school. Maybe I just lost any and all passion of living. I'll admit, I made a lot of messed up decisions and probably wouldn't be as suicidal as I am now if I didn't mess up immensely, but to be honest? I'm in a state to where I really just don't want to deal with anything anymore. I'm not even upset about it either, although I have Major Depressive Disorder. I just don't really feel anything, and in a way that's worse than being straight-up sad or depressed. Maybe I'll feel something when I die? Maybe in death, I'll start feeling again? Death, unlike anything else, is permanent, and maybe it's exactly what I'm looking for. A break from the mundane. The routine. A way for me to escape my haunted past, perhaps.",1

"Years ago I first started developing depression and anxiety symptoms due to bullying and stress in school, mainly due to being neurodivergent. It made my life a living hell because I had no friends and my own family would call me r3tarded or say I was ‚Äúacting dramatic‚Äù if I tried to open up. If I showed any deeper symptoms, they‚Äôd tell me I‚Äôd get locked up in ‚ÄúThe Loony Bin‚Äù where I‚Äôd be strapped down to a bed and pumped full of pills like a slave. Hearing that was already terrifying enough, but to hear very real and very similar incidents happen to people I knew didn‚Äôt make it any better.

None of them know this, but I almost went through with overdosing one night in the 7th grade due to a humiliating incident that turned out to be my breaking point. For whatever reason, I just couldn‚Äôt go through with it. Maybe it was my dog or my few online mutuals on PopJam, but instead, I just cried myself to sleep and foolishly hoped that I wouldn‚Äôt wake up the next morning. I had a similar incident due to an ex, but that was less severe I think. 

My family would always tell me that ‚Äúdepression was temporary and it‚Äôll go away on its own‚Äù but it never did for me.

Years later those thoughts just became passive. I didn‚Äôt want to kill myself, but at the same time I didn‚Äôt care what happened to me anymore. I didn‚Äôt care if I got kidnapped, or got run over, or anything like that. As long as it was quick I wouldn‚Äôt mind. There were times I would walk on bridges and have intrusive thoughts about jumping off. 

Even when going through diagnosis stuff and even when some people asked, I could never tell the full truth that I had suicidal thoughts. The idea of being abused, assaulted and cut off from the rest of the world in a closed facility was a concept worse than death to me. Even prisoners had more rights than that. It was essentially a punishment for not getting the job done yourself, run by people that only saw broken individuals as trash to be repurposed instead of fixed.

But I‚Äôm tired of living in mental exhaustion everyday, waiting for something else to kill me. I‚Äôm tired of not knowing what I want to do with myself one day and feeling like I‚Äôm just a useless background character in everyone else‚Äôs life. I actually have a few people I care about and want to stay for. But I don‚Äôt want to keep living like this anymore and I don‚Äôt know how to change the way I feel. I‚Äôve tried getting out more and getting into hobbies but they‚Äôre never permanent solutions to the pain. I want to tell someone so maybe they‚Äôll finally understand why I am the way I am. But I don‚Äôt want to risk being tortured if I say the wrong thing or too much. If anyone has any advice, I‚Äôd appreciate it.

"I just want to state I'm doing okay in terms of a place to work and a house to stay at. I'd say I'm dealing with less stress than the average person working in the US. The issue is I'm breaking mentally when I thought I overcame some of my biggest problems that held me down. I use to deal with a lot of depression and anxiety. It held me back horribly and I tormented myself In the past thinking how the way people treat me I must deserve to suffer. I thought that maybe I had done something so horrible in a past life that I absolutely deserved the hurtful things friends would do to me. I'd lay in night crying about how I would be better off if I had disappeared and the only thing that stopped me was not wanting to end my life just out right sense who knows where you go and what damage I would cause to people finding out I killed myself. Even my family treated me horrible as a kid I know I was not raised well. I wasn't raised horribly but I still went through stuff that caused me to develop how I felt about how I deserved to suffer. I know it was what caused my anxiety. Even back then when I expressed my severe panic attacks no one tried to help. They even found out I was cutting cause I tried getting help through a suicide hotline who just threw cops my way so I had to get cuffed and sent to a mental hospital. Explains why I don't go there for help anymore.

Of course I no longer face this exact challenge of hating myself. I actually have grown to accept the things I like and and who I am. I have bought things I like to look at like art and just stuff that would help me. Ultimately I begun taking care of myself and loving myself. With all of this it was very impowering I felt good about life. The last time I felt depression/anxiety was 5 months ago when my bestfriend who I talked to everyday for a year started ghosting me. She had moved back home and shortly after the energy we equally put in started halting. I gave it time thinking oh she just wants to be with family for a bit. A month passed. I had grown to hold a lot of anxiety and concern the friendship was ending. I expressed my feelings of how ever sense she moved back home I felt I wasn't someone she liked anymore. Like I was just used to pass the time she was away from home. I only received deflections and how my comment hurt her. I was just shocked.

What made all of this worse is I had just helped this friend get a new pc with a good amount of money. Money I was anxious to spend but there were no issues in the friendship prior. We always worked things out we always played games and did voice chat. When she needed someone to vent to I tried to be there for her. I gave her advice helped her away from bad friends. Showed her how to be more positive and get through work. I put so much into it and I loved it. That friend felt like a sister to me that I didn't have. Just like that though I was no longer even a thought to them. They said they would pay me back first. They ended up paying others back first. I asked them about it. They said how I told them they could take their time. I did. Though there was absolutely desire being shown to pay me back. 2-3 months in no money was given back. I was dying over this. I spent a year with this person almost daily sharing so much. Now I'm not only not worth talking to but I'm not even worth getting the money back that I so kindheartedly loaned. Remembering hearing how she looked up to me so much. Hearing how I helped so much. So I guess it wasn't meant at all. Or they liked my actions but not me as a person. Eventually I had looked into stuff and my mind switched. I was done treating myself bad over all the stuff that went wrong.

I started taking care of myself and buying things for myself. It honestly didn't feel as good but I know it was helping and after sometime I realized how horrible those close friends were to me. So I started trying to better determine my friends and started a goal of staying out of friendships that had drama. Anyone who I had issues with I put a long stick between us at the very least. This horrible event at least gave me room to treat myself better. Then it started. I started realizing how sickening it was for people to treat such a sweet person like that. To selfishly use me like that. Use me as a wallet. Use me for emotional validation. Use me to fill in their boredom. Most of the closest people hurt me the most. Said some of the most vial things I had heard. It all ended on such bad terms. It made me question if I should have anymore close friends. Shortly after someone who I considered a friend started trying to make me mad. I knew what they were doing cause they started instigating things. They even expressed how they were trying to instigate. I can't just leave this friend because a good friend hangout with him. I'd have to leave as a whole.

All of these little details all of these little actions that I saw in people. I saw how sickening we are as Humans. We steal from people who love us. We use them like tools. We do anything to make ourselves feel better even if it means someone dies. What was unbearable an amount of depression and anxiety is now an unbearable amounts of anger building up more and more. I knew how everyone close to me treated me so disgusting. No one sacrificed anything for me. No one did anything that was at their inconvenience. No one in this world wants to be understanding. No one wants to put in the same effort all the time. My friend group is getting smaller and smaller. I don't make anymore friends. So it just seems like a painful process of me losing all my friends in some disgusting way eventually and I'd have no way of know sense most just switched up on me. Where they take advantage of me or use me in any kind of way. Where at the end of it my health is never a concern to them. Its disgusting how much stuff I dealt with that was horrible as someone with such a big heart.

Now I don't know who to trust anymore. I don't know whos going to toy with me next. I know I can't make any friends not that I don't talk to people but because I'm such a different person from everyone else. My interests are niche and very few people ever know them. No one really gets my way of joking a lot and Im so spastic. I have a lot of energy and I just act dumb because its fun. I don't hate me for this but I know the way I am doesn't bring anyone in which as a human is making me feel very lonely. So while I'm losing people there is absolutely no one showing up in life. I'm growing up and I know less and less people will like my way of joking and interests. Its just saddening cause I use to love people and I wanted to give someone the most a human could. I wanted to experience true love. The closer I got to this it felt like life was stabbing me in the most painful way it could. People I thought I knew who lured me in only to use me and throw me away.

So despite wanting to love people and care for people and help I now Just feel so much disgust and hatred. I'm so full of anger and it gets worse everyday. I stay physically active to hopefully burn off this anger but I can still feel it there. Even if I manage to get it out of my mind during it comes back. Its just there. I'm so disgusted by what Human do. It feels like truly humanity was never full of love. It was never a place with good people. I just hate how no one cares. Whats the point. Whats my purpose. I just want to say fuck it and leave everything. I don't want to deal with this shit anymore. Getting close to someone just means a big chance at me getting screwed over in some way. I don't know how to feel or what to do now. everything is just feeling worse. I just feel like blowing my brains out. There is no good here. I won't even feel that happiness i did from friends in anything else and I've been trying. I want to be happy but I can't find anything to distract me away from this anger like those friendships did. I love my hobbies and interests but I'm not a fueled to them. At least when i do them yes I enjoy it but this anger comes back.

I'm so sick of it. Its tormenting. You think you make it into a peaceful happy life then either someone or life itself kicks you down as soon as you get better. I just don't want to be here anymore. Not even cause I hate myself. I actually want myself to be okay so just imagining ending it all being free from this painful headache. From all the sickening humans out there. That sounds lovely. Its sound like that would be the only thing I'd have to finally put my mind at rest. No more emotions that take over my life. It would be fine if I could be okay for a whole year without breaking down so bad like this. But i don't ever get that. Sense 13 my like has just felt like shit. I don't know how to feel anymore. Yeah maybe I can ride this out but ya know when you actively snap into a positive mindset finally and then anger comes along to kick it out. Well whats the point. All of that work is gone. Its obviously impacting my friendships and even work. I can't talk to people when the thought of blowing my head of is in my mind or when the crippling disgust of all the horrible things people have done to me is catching up. I'm just so annoyed now. I haven't hurt anyone but I've just stopped showing up. Only 2 fucking people would care about where I am and the other would be concerned about me.

Well I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't really have anyone to go to with this. Its funny I wanna give up on Humanity and stop relying on people but I'm here. I just want peace really. Also if anyone is concerned please don't have police show up again. That actually caused me to lose a lot of trust too. Maybe I'm just paranoid now cause how would they tap my stuff on here but whos knows. Just send the police to deal with the guy who needs comfort and care. I know it would be expecting a lot for some to read and respond sense nothing is ever really free but yeah. Well thanks if anyone does. I'm gonna lay down and hope I can swiftly fall asleep before it gets even worse.",1
"What I can‚Äôt understand is how people have such strong feelings. They have the motivation to get up, to feed and clothe and wash themselves, to go to a job, to heal themselves when they‚Äôre ill. And the people who are suicidal - they feel hate towards themselves, or the world, or sadness.

I just feel nothing. I look at the world and I just think what is inspiring about that. I have no idea why the average person gets up in the morning because I am one of them and none of this feels worth trying for to me. It all just feels so pointless - it‚Äôs so much effort to stay alive and for what exactly? A boring world full of boring mundane days and tasks, the same social interactions over and over. I just don‚Äôt care? 

I feel like people expect depression to be strong feelings of sadness but I wish I could feel that because I don‚Äôt even gaf enough to look after myself. I just think the world is overrated in the same way you might look at a supermarket offer and think ‚Äúnot good value for money‚Äù.

I feel empty as many bad things are continuously happened with me and I don't know what to do as I know if I do anything I will end up being a loser again as this loneliness and heartbroken feeling killing me from inside and making me feel like worthless and loser
Help me what should I do...",1
"After i (26m) broke up w my gf (23f), i feel like i became dysfunctional. i set a list of things i want to do in order to grow as a person like exercise, get my driver's license, excel in my job.

I was working along those things consistently for a month, it tapered off in the 2nd, before i finally lost motivation. I slumped. I spent the last month's worth of weekends rotting on my bed.

It's been 3 months since we broke up. This is really bad. My career is now struggling and it's very irresponsible of me to burden my teammates for personal reasons but i just can't function.

I think i need someone to push or coach me but realistically, I'm 26. There's no one to do that for me anymore. I'm an adult. 

I don't know how to go on. I miss her so much and i am incredibly lonely. I don't know who to seek and I don't want to go back to my old friends, after so long, just to let them hear me whine. It'll be as if i am only there when i need an emotional bolster.

I have already processed things and formed conclusions on how it wont work out if we were together and how she was not good for me. But this didn't help at all to making me miss her less, it only rationalised why i am here, not solve the pain. I also processed my shortfalls but my fear is the inability to grow from it and my current dysfunctionality is validating that fear. There are aspects in my life which were like this for a decade: where i couldn't grow in no matter how much i tried.

If this is one of those areas, I don't see anything good. I don't see how i can be fixed. It's looking very very bad. ",1
"I'm a fat ugly autist with no will to live. I'm ugly, very boring personality, have constant intrusive thoughts, don't feel human, and the only person who cares about me on earth is my mother. I'm ending my life in a few weeks.",1
"I‚Äôm fat, short, autistic, epileptic, can‚Äôt work, can‚Äôt drive, and failing my family by existing and not bringing in money. 

My husband needs someone who can provide for him and his chronic illness. Not me. Our gf has a good job. Maybe if I‚Äôm gone, then they can get married and try to have a happy life with our dog and our ferret. 

I can‚Äôt even bring children into this world because I don‚Äôt have insurance. My mother intentionally made it so I would fail at the most basic level of adulthood because she hated me. How am I supposed to make this work when no one believes me or believes in me? 

I‚Äôm supposed to take a train next month‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôll just get off at the next stop and disappear. Whatever that means. Or just leave my stuff behind and step in front of said train. It‚Äôll be over if I do. I‚Äôve already got a will. Any stuff I have goes to my husband, as long as he‚Äôs alive. 

Sure, our dog might miss me but our dog loves my husband more than me anyway. 

I‚Äôm just so tired‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hoping I seize and die not gonna lie. ",1
"my life has always been shit. everyone always told me that it'll get better someday but that never happened. I just hate my life so much, I hate myself, my environment and everything else too. I'm 20 (f) and have been depressed since I was 14, have very bad social anxiety ever since I could remember &amp; to top it off I am autistic. 

these days, the only thing that really makes me happy is smoking weed &amp; occasionally taking other drugs. I've just started a new job &amp; even though I'm proud of myself for finally doing something with my life (I graduated 3 years ago) I hate myself for being so stupid and anxious at work. I lay in bed all day, scrolling on tik tok or instagram, distracting myself from living. I don't have any friends &amp; I do have a boyfriend, but I'm not that happy when I'm with him either. besides work I don't do ANYTHING and it's frustrating me because I can't get myself to do anything. why am I so lazy?? I'm literally burnt out from doing nothing all day. I have a gym membership but I never go cause my anxiety is just way too high. 

I do hate my body &amp; I wish I could bring myself to go to the gym, but I don't eat enough. I even hate eating, it feels like a chore and nothing that I enjoy anymore. I hate how I look, especially my body, since I don't really eat much I'm way too thin and almost look sick. I've spent such a long time trying to love myself, at one point I just decided to give up. I feel like I am so ugly &amp; even though people tell me that I'm not, I'm so self conscious of myself. I feel like even how I'm walking is wrong, I hate my posture and my teeth, I hate how I dress &amp; I don't have any money to buy myself nice things. I compare myself to so many beautiful women online &amp; know that I'll never be happy with my looks. 
it doesn't matter how many times I change my hair, change my make up, my personality, I still always end up hating myself. 

I also have a pretty sad home life. both of my parents don't work, growing up we never had any money &amp; sometimes there wasn't even enough money for food. I have 5 siblings, 2 of whom I don't speak to. my parents have a lot of debt, even making debt in my name. as a child I also saw the police at home often, since my father did a lot of illegal things. at home it's always dirty, since my mom never cleans &amp; my siblings don't really care either. I'm the only one who's always cleaning, but I don't get appreciated &amp; I don't want to tidy up anymore. I would do anything to get out of here since I also have to share a room with my 2 sisters, but I don't have enough money. 

I don't have any hobbies, I hate everything and I regret not killing myself when I was 16 and still had the guts to do it. now I'm just slowly rotting away day by day. I wake up nauseous every day due to my anxiety, I've had sleeping problems since forever and I also have migraines almost everyday. I feel like my body will give up on its own slowly. 

I've tried finding my way to god, but I didn't feel better. I even tried manifestation and spirituality but nothing fucking works. I've tried waking up early, sleeping 8 hours or 4 hours is no difference, everyday I wake up tired of life. I want to go outside when I'm inside &amp; I always want to go home when I'm outside. I don't belong anywhere, I don't know who I am. everyday I look into the mirror and don't know who I'm looking at, it's like I'm a stranger to myself. I lost my teenage years to depression &amp; now I'm 20 and will never get those years back. I don't even know why I'm writing this right now, or if anyone will even read through this, but I just feel so alone and like life is a chore. 
maybe I should start therapy, but where I life it's impossible to find a therapist. I just want to life like everyone else, I don't want to be me anymore. I live in a constant state of stress, but I can't even cry anymore, I haven't cried in months even though I'm so miserable. 

I don't want to die, but I feel like I don't belong here. I feel like an outsider &amp; my autism only makes it harder for me to live. when I'll die someday, I hope everyone regrets how they treated me. 

will I ever be okay?",1
"I can‚Äôt take it anymore man the fact that I am so wildly different from everyone else around me in a way that only they can see has been weighing on me particularly hard recently, and it frustrates me to no end that I will never be able to fix it because I am autistic and I just have to accept that. It makes me feel so unlovable, I‚Äôm almost incapable of making friends, and my one close relationship is with my abusive boyfriend who I‚Äôm too scared to leave because he‚Äôs literally the only person who likes me- but even then he doesn‚Äôt respect me. I don‚Äôt understand why I can‚Äôt just be normal",1
"i want to kill myself again. ive been fine for a long time, nothing more or less. I even graduated group therapy a few months ago after 2 years of treatment. I havent self harmed in 2 years, and in most of that time i didnt even think about relapsing. but i dont even fucking know how much time i have left now. been struggling with PTSD since i was 14; sexually assaulted 8 times before i even turned 13. im never going to live a normal life. not a day has gone by since my diagnosis where i havent been completely debilitated by my paranoia and flashbacks. Where i havent felt disgusting, dirty and unable to be clean the burden of mankinds cruelty off my skin. i never got justice. i have to go to school with my abuser. i fought so hard for months and years to get some kind of justice or any kind of closure and it hasnt happened. it wont ever happen. I told counslers, friends, therapists, police officers, security guards, family. Nothing. every day for weeks id be in the nurses office, sick to my stomach because id be forced to see my abusers face in the hallway. It happened too long ago for them to even do anything. middle school, when i was so fucking stupid and niave that i didnt even realize i was being sexually exploited and physically abused and i just let it happen for 2 years because i thought it was normal. i thought it made our friendship stronger. i couldnt even fight back anyway. i just let it happen. and now its too late. ive been angry and sick and tormented for so long. i want to be at peace amd make the fear stop. ive been almost completely alone in this fight since the day it began and i cant help but resent every single living person around me for being able to live normal lives. im so scared. i never got to be a child. I died the first time i was assaulted and ive been dead since then. its all my fault. it couldnt have been more obvious what was happening and i was so stupid. I was a stupid 10 year old little girl. why couldnt i save her? why didnt anybody save me/?? everyone saw it happen and nobody helped.i just let it happen like i had no other purpose in my life other than being groped and hit like a dog. have all my youth stripped from my dying body. even when i felt fine, i never was. my trauma was a wound that never closed, never scabbed, and never scarred; it just bled and bled.   
every time i lay there bleeding on the bathroom floor in the dead of night, i imagined that someone was there to hold my head on a towel in their lap and press rags of warm water into my legs and carry me back to bed. bed where im safe and w arm. i love my best friend and if i cant fight for much longer then i hope you can forgive me.i love my cats, tortilla chip and chloe. i love when you roll on your back and let me pet your fuzzy belly and drool all over me when i pet you. if there comes a day sometime in the near future where i decide to make all the endless buzzing in my head stop, ill be thinking of you too.",1
I just broke up with my girlfriend who makes me the most happiest person in the world but I did it for her good we want to get married but I doubt I‚Äôll make it to the age 25 so I‚Äôm doing what‚Äôs best for her and I feel like I‚Äôve done the right thing she doesn‚Äôt know how much of a failure I am I don‚Äôt think she cares but I won‚Äôt waste her time I feel like us being together is just giving her false hope for a long time relationship ,1
I‚Äôm going to end up posting on here every day for the rest of my life. Someone just kill me. It seems so impossible to find a way to succeed in doing it myself. How do people do it and sometimes at such a young age. I legitimately wish someone would try and rob me or something and I‚Äôd just ask them to shoot me. I can‚Äôt go on.,1
"After the loss of a family member,  there was a lot of concern about my mental health and my risk for suicide, since I've had suicidal ideologies after leaving the military.

Prior, I spent a better part of a decade to get better and found solace in family, I've never been happier or as content with life less than a month ago.

When that all came crashing down, they tried to hide my guns and asked if I needed to go somewhere for awhile to sort myself out but I couldn't leave what was left of my family to grieve without me.

The guilt and regrets are eating me alive, I lost over 15lbs in 3 weeks, I hardly sleep anymore, the drugs make me have lucid dreams, so I quit them for my sanity, but I also want to dream of her in a better place.

Whatever 'faith' I had is gone, I realize that there isn't any Supreme being or heaven or a metaphysical place we all go to when we die.

I welcome this self destruction of myself, I deserve it, I failed, my life is meaningless in the grand scheme of things, I'm not going to cure cancer, I'm not going to be the  president of the United States, I'm just 1 of several billions and my mark on this world will be inconsequential. 

I did have one thing, one of the best things to ever happen to me is now gone and I can't think of how things can get better, because I had it all everything I ever dreamed of came true, I was happy and content and that's all gone now and there's nothing to gain or achieve anymore. My ambition was set and completed and I don't know if I can start over as there is nothing left to accomplish in my life. Nothing.

They took away my guns temporarily because of my past history but I have them back while my hostility and hatred has returned from the dead I fear my self destruction is imminent and nothing can stop me now. I'm not control anymore, God help those who try me because I don't care about the repercussions of my actions and I can easily justify it in my fucked up head. Might as well kill me now, that's what I want more than anything ",1
I‚Äôm not scared to die but at the same time I am. I want to escape this hellhole but I‚Äôm only 13. Moving out is gonna be hard when parents don‚Äôt even love you. I just wanna end it already but I‚Äôm fucking scared,1
"I got non voluntarily admitted to inpatient treatment despite telling the police that I had no thoughts or intentions of suicide, and at the time it was true. While I was in I called my wife about getting discharged and found out that she was leaving me. I thought I would be ok when I got home but seeing all of her stuff gone as well as our pets I find myself wanting nothing more than to just end it and be free of everything. We were together almost 15 years and she and our pets were my biggest emotional supports. I'm scared to try it with trazadone but I find myself staring at the bottle wanting nothing more than to die.

"Since 11. My first attempt all because my mom was mad at me for losing my iPod. An ipod. They way she acted made me resort to that, so young. 

My mom was an awful mother. Said and did way too many things a parent never should, even sexually assaulting me when I was 12. 

My ex boyfriend was abusive too. He also sexually assaulted me multiple times. Why did I let that happen. I don‚Äôt know. Maybe I thought because he still loved me even though h he hurt me, just like my mother. 

Being strong for so long is very tiring. I wish, I wish I was able to do it. But I can‚Äôt.

"Basically as it suggests\~ I'm a 21 year old (F) who has struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a preteen. This is my first and I hope only boyfriend but I feel my own mental health struggles are causing a rift in our relationship. He has told me he resents me for the times i've gotten irrationally mad at him. I can see where he comes from and when i'm overstimulated or overwhelmed I don't handle it well, plain and simple I can be a bit of a b\*tch. On top of all this, my mood changes so rapidly he feels he has to walk on eggshells sometimes, I get in depressive moods which tell me that I don't deserve love and I don't deserve him. 

Further, I feel sometimes I wish i'd die or be murdered so he could let go of me (of a future with me) because all I want is for him to be happy. Although it would break me, its worth letting him go so he can be happier, more fulfilled, and appreciated in a relationship than he is now with me. I feel he deserves so much more than what I am giving him and I would die just to do that. I have told him on occasion these exact thoughts which has left him emotionally numb. I can tell that he has grown tired of this constant narrative of mine, he often tells me to ""just not"", and I sense I have caused him emotional trauma since he rarely and typically refuses to express his emotions with me anymore. 

I hold so much guilt for the pain I have caused him and I wish he would focus his attention towards someone more worthy of his unconditional love. 

I have gone to years of therapy on and off, I contextualize and intellectualize my emotions so much that I always feel multiple emotions at once in a given situation and fall into depressive patterns such as these whenever a stressor is present (intense uni schedule or narcissistic mom). All I want to do is not feel so many emotions anymore and sometimes I think its better for my boyfriend and myself if I died. 

My heart goes out to those who also feel this way. ",1

"Last week I tried OD'ing, ended up in the ER, lived (obviously xD), It was in the middle of a mental breakdown but the week before I kinda felt it coming, and asked to be put in a mental hospital as I was a danger to myself, they kept me with family for around 2 days, then let me be alone and that happened. 

The trip from the OD ended last tuesday, 2 full days in my memory gone, but whatever I guess, we live n learn to live with it. The last couple of days have been pretty good, again with family, but this time doing more fun stuff, and I genuinely felt really good.

My days tend to be alright, my nights breakdowns, until I fall asleep. I only had breakdowns the last 2 nights, but the suicidal thoughts are back. Again. And since I last week was my first genuinely attempt, I'm scared I might do it again. I don't want to, now, when I'm lucid. Before I wasn't put in a mental hospital when I begged for it.

"i had a suffocation feeling like panic attack earlier and had to go to the ER. i‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs dealt with severe anxiety his whole life, as i had to take antidepressants when i was 9, but this panic attack was just different. i felt like i was truly, without a doubt, about to die, but with other panic attacks i‚Äôve had hope. anyway, i survived, and i feel terrible about it. i feel guilty. i feel bad for anyone who talks to me or wants to be friends with me and i feel bad for being in anyone‚Äôs life. i purposely ignore people sometimes because i feel bad that they take the time out of their day to talk to me. i used to not be like this at all, as i was very attached to everyone and clingy. last few months, i lost all the close friendships/significant relationships i had in my life and more than half of them just ghosted me without reason. it makes me think, wow, i really wasn‚Äôt even worth an explanation after all those years? it‚Äôs insane to me. i also lost my first love who was my fp back in december. for context, i have bpd, ocd, bipolar depression, and anxiety. living with these losses have been extremely difficult. i felt a continuous feeling of grief for months. when i was 15, i started taking drugs and even had to do drug tests because i was always on something. i‚Äôm sober now, but i‚Äôve recently gotten back into sh. i have emotionally abusive parents which doesn‚Äôt help. i have an extremely bad relationship w my mom. she SA me and verbally abuses me everyday. i also grew up on the internet which lead me to have fucked up kinks and stuff. i know this is all over the place, but all these things really just combine into the truth, that my life is worthless. i genuinely wish i die every night, i don‚Äôt care, i do impulsive things all the time due to my recklessness. i wish i was born as someone who brings something good into this world. i‚Äôm not good at a lot of things people can do without a second thought. my grades are terrible. i plan to kms when i turn 18-22, that age range. i‚Äôm getting super close to being 18, and the urge is just more tempting. sorry to anyone that reads this. hope i don‚Äôt wake up tomorrow",1
"My cousin and I grew up together. We've been like siblings and best friends since we were young. I moved away to the United States and she went to a different city for University.
I came back this summer for vacation and we spent a few days together last week before she went back to school.
I could tell she was feeling down. She has lost a lot of weight since I saw her. I noticed she developed an ED and tried my best to make her eat more. 
Yesterday I went on Snapchat and saw her story she made about her healing journey from depression.
Turns out, she's been extremely depressed and self harming. According to her this is not the first attempt but the 32nd.
As I was scrolling through I felt like a failure for not recognising the obvious signs. And at the end of her story she said she relapsed again and goodbye for the last time.
She sent me s snap of her arm attached to an IV (I saw this before her Snapchat story) I called her several times she didn't pick up.
She just replied to me that she's hospitalised for attempt and that she'll call me later.

I have no idea what to say to her to help her. We are separated by cities and I don't think her parents know about it. I'm scared to tell them because it will feel like I'm breaking her trust and sharing something she doesn't want to share.

I understand her a little since I had multiple suicidal thoughts myself but never had the courage to go through with it.

I genuinely don't know what to do and this whole thing made me so depressed.

"i have been having suicidal tendencies these past few months, even trying and sh. i opened up about it to my parents and every time they offer to take me to a ward i get scared. do i just go?",1
"I am 30 years old. My mother is a very very wealthy woman ( I didn‚Äôt find out until I was 21). But I didn‚Äôt grow up that way. I raised thinking we were poor. My mom would let the gas, electricity, etc get caught off. Never got an allowance, and never went on fancy trips. 
I was not spoiled. I had jobs since I was 14, bought my own car. My mom constantly, every day 24 hours a day stated how much she hated having kids and having a house. And how we‚Äôre getting evicted the next day. Or we‚Äôre going be on the streets next week. Really makes you feel worthless. 

The only piece of advice my mom ever gave me was ‚Äúmajor in health science‚Äù.  I did just that. I majored in biology and since then 9 years ago‚Ä¶to date over 5000 Job applications. No job. And 10 total interviews. For context I‚Äôve been rejected from:
1300 entry level hospital desk jobs
500+ office assistant jobs 
500+ admin assistant jobs 
Dominoes delivery driver 5x
Post office cashier 10x 
100+ Office mail clerk 
Hospital greeter 20x 
150+ receptionist jobs
250+ bio research jobs 
Enterprise rent a car 15x 
Amazon warehouse worker 20x
I wasn‚Äôt the best student but definitely above average and I have a decent resume/work history. Still, I‚Äôve done evey applicable google cert. hubspot cert. Microsoft cert. countless resume/cover letter courses. I‚Äôve emailed almost 300 hiring managers. Zero have ever responded to me. 
I got a 14/hour job at a medical office and that‚Äôs where I‚Äôve been the last 4 years. A few years ago I developed a cancerous and painful tumor. I asked my mom if she could help me pay for an MRI. She said we couldn‚Äôt afford it. And said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pray for you‚Äù. After 6 months in agony still working. I found a doctor that took my shitty insurance and he said he could keep me comfortable for year or so before the cancer killed me. Since I couldn‚Äôt even begin to afford treatment. I came to peace with that. I had a minimum wage job, no savings, I lost the love of my life who waited patiently for years for me to get a decent job, and nothing to show in life. I accepted it  and I was ready to die. 

At the 11th hour my mom swooped in, talked me off the ledge, got me better insurance, and got me cancer free. 6 rounds of chemo and 3 surgeries. I am now cancer free. But at the end, my mom left me with the bills and went straight back to her cold dismissive ways. High five figures that I could never pay back. I am back where I started in a perpetual cycle of rejection but now with staggering medical debt. 

People say go back to school or get this or that certification but I could never afford too then and definitely not now with the medical debt. 

I still drive the same car I had when I was 17 and it‚Äôs on its last legs. I tried to join the military but my diagnosis made me ‚Äúunfit for service‚Äù  I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt have any hope. Nothing on the horizon. ",1

"I‚Äôm thinking of ending things tonight. I‚Äôve struggled all my life with depression, I‚Äôve worked through it with therapy and discovered coping mechanisms. 
But tonight is too much. I‚Äôve worked through pain from childhood, long term relationship ending and my closest family member and best friend passing away. I spoke to my ex tonight, and have realised the love I felt for all those years was never reciprocated in the same way. One person who I thought really saw me for who I was, did, and decided I wasn‚Äôt enough. 
That‚Äôs not the reason to end things, but it just feels like the last straw.

"I know heartbreak isn‚Äôt a reason to end it but I‚Äôve never felt more alone than right now. I lost the love of my life and am left with even more trauma than I have the space to carry. My entire support system is gone because I‚Äôve pushed them all away either because they have feelings for me or because I feel like a burden for being so depressed all the time. My only friend is the person my ex cheated on me with and I feel bad for burdening him too. I think he‚Äôs only friends with me out of guilt for the situation. I‚Äôve attempted in the past but those who cared for me always stepped in. Now that I‚Äôm alone, I feel like I can do it with minimal heartache to anyone else. I know it will hurt my ex and my one friend, but I can‚Äôt keep fighting and I think they would understand. I finally have the opportunity to do it without hurting anyone. I recently attempted while on the phone with my friend but he started crying and calling out my name begging me not to and it stopped me. It hurt so badly to hear him hurt because of me but I hurt all the time now and I‚Äôm burdening everyone else with my hurt. I won‚Äôt tell him I‚Äôm doing it this time. He can‚Äôt stop what he doesn‚Äôt know. So before I go, I want to say I‚Äôve tried everything I could to feel better. Nothing is working. Not drugs or alcohol or self harm or self help literature or talking to friends and family or nature walks or going on drives. Everything is grey. I‚Äôm tired and empty and I give up.

I want help but I feel like I have to do this. I‚Äôm on 4 different medications and they don‚Äôt seem to be doing anything meaningful for my mental health. I feel hopeless. I got extensions to the end of summer for my classes cause I was hospitalized in April but I haven‚Äôt done anything meaningful in those. I‚Äôve lost so many relationships and now I have nobody. Everyone that I cared about stopped caring for me. My family cares but they put a lot of pressure on me to get better as quick as possible and I can‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm just done.,1
"I swear I'm cursed or something. Bad shit keeps happening to me, it's not been a very good few months already and now I've got to deal with this too. 

I've had symptoms of bowel cancer for a while now, but I just assumed it was something else since I'm young so I ignored it. Last week the symptoms got so unbelievably bad that I had to see my doctor. I was hoping for something simple but he ruled out hemorrhoids or a fissure an had me do a FIT test. I maxed out that test, literally as high as it could measure. There's only a couple diseases that can cause that result, and the only one that matches my symptoms is cancer. I'll have an endoscopy soon to confirm though.

Ive almost certainly got cancer, at 23 years old. Ill probably lose all my hair from chemo and look like a man. They might have to cut out parts of my bowels. I might need a permanent colostomy bag. Maybe it's spread to other parts of my body and I'm basically dead already.

I am so fucking scared. I just want to give up, I don't want to go through all that pain. I've tried to kill myself over less, and I'm finding right now that it's a very attractive option.",1
"I'm going to kill myself and I'd like to post my suicide note here; I have it in writing but I'd like to have it somewhere where it is widely available to read. I'm really sorry and I wish things could be different. I really do.

To Whom It May Concern,

I'd like to start off by saying that what I end up doing was nobody's fault; this was the a decision that was the result of a lot of different factors. I will sum things up by saying that my life was not one that anyone would ever want to live. Sure, bad things happen to everyone--but I am inadequate. In every facet of existence I fall short of the mark. I have no talents, I am alone even when I'm around others, I have no drive to attempt things because I know that I will fail. I used to love writing (it is what is driving me to write this) but I have come to realize that this thing I loved was merely just a way to avoid the loneliness of my reality--the sadness that nothing will get better; I was just as bad at it as everything else unfortunately. I was not made for life. It is a strange statement, but one I know to be true. If I were anyone else I'd be happy and not writing this. Some people are given bad lives, but those people can overcome them and go on to have wonderful lives. I am not one of these people; once I drew that short straw my fate was sealed. Some people are just not meant to be born.

For awhile I thought things were getting better; in 2019 I had a job that I loved, friends that I cared for and that I believe cared for me, and a family situation that was pleasant enough. Right around this time, when things were looking up, the pandemic hit and things became the worst they'd ever been. My job (one in the medical field) fell into chaos and deteriorated my mental state further; eventually we were bought out and I had to quit. My mother also went missing around this time while camping and they have still not found a trace of her. In the aftermath of the pandemic my friends drew away from me and now it is as if I do not exist to them. I wanted to go to school, but this too the pandemic prevented. If this had not happened I think things could have been bearable for a little while longer.

Every day that I lived was a trail and I was always overcome with a sense of loneliness and despair. I felt that life was a prison and I didn't know how to escape or why I was even in this prison. Some people may ask what my problems were or offered advice, but this could never help in anyway because they could not understand what I feel every day--they did not have to endure the pain that life caused me. It was never about the problems--not at its core; these only served to heighten this pain. The only time I ever felt free was when I was sleeping, only there was I free of the pain, in my dreams. Dreams of a better existence, surrounded by people that wanted me around, of experiences I could never have in the waking world. My sleep was a reality of love, of warmth and belonging, and it is my hope that I'll return there in a more permanent capacity. That was the only place that my hopes were made manifest. You may not understand anything I'm saying, nothing I'm describing, and if that's the case then it is good news! Because you are not feeling what I am feeling and I am very glad for that.

I'm sure I sound crazy, but no therapist could have helped, even if I could have afforded it (which I could not). I understand the function of SSRIs and of the chemical imbalance that occurs in those with depression. I do not have depression, these medications would not have worked; what I had was a terminal outlook on life and a ceaseless soul-crushing anguish. There are people like me who cannot be helped, no matter how hard you try: it is an effort in futility. Please know that no amount of help could have changed my decision, and please do not blame yourselves for this, because it was well out of your control.

I could ask for your forgiveness, but a complete waste like me does not deserve it. I understand if you hate me, that is something I do deserve. I've tried to better myself, I've tried to help others, but nothing I do truly matters. I'm just so tired of everything. I know that I'm leaving a lot of stuff behind, just do with it as you please, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience that this causes you. For that, I am a horrible person.

"I know 988 is confidential and they're supposed to help, but I have a really hard time trusting it or putting my safety in the hands of others in general. I always feel like something bad is going to happen if I tell anyone how I truly feel. I started therapy again last week but I know it'll take me forever to open up to my therapist and I'm really scared. I have so many people that I love, who love me too, but I truly feel like a burden to everyone and like nothing good will come from living a long life.

"ive been starting counseling at two places, one being some psychiatry place. my mother and stepfather refuse to let me get medical treatment for my declining mental health, which means they say no to medication and possible psych ward stays. they say if i want to do meds or go to a psych ward, i have to live with my biological father, who i hate. i dont know how to tell them that if they finalize paperwork and tickets to send me down there, i will kill myself. they need to let go of their beliefs for the sake of me.

i dont know how to tell them that if they try to send me down there, i will disappear and they wont see me again. thats just it. all i want is to finally feel again, and if that takes some diagnoses and medication so be it. it will be on them as to why im dead. i cant fucking stand this.",1
Weirdly I‚Äôve been able to cope with my suicidal ideation by fixating on it. Just comforting to think this life is one trigger pull away. They tell you not to dwell on negative impulses but I find it helps to imagine finally going through with it. I can take a bad day because I already know what the barrel of a 9mm tastes like. I‚Äôm not going to rush ending it all cuz I know I can do it anytime. It‚Äôs weirdly comforting. Am I crazy? ,1

everyone has gone to sleep, i cant as always and i just feel so sad(as always but worse bc drugs) 
anyway i was just wondering if anyone could just talk until i am able to sleep -i am scared that if im alone for too long i will act a fool because of the way the drink and drugs are making me feel
thankyou

"First I want to say I came from r/therapy the auto mod said to come here so here I am
Here's my original message:

I don't really feel like explaining my whole life story right now, just know it's really only getting worse.  To put it simply, I've lost basically all my friends.  I've lost my dog and my girlfriend.  My parents seem so unhappy with their lives as adults, and I really just don't enjoy life anymore.

On top of that, the world is a crazy shitshow and I really don't understand what the point in living is.  What great reason is there to go on?  For love?  I highly doubt with my mentally unstable self, I will ever find someone who loves me unconditionally.  For money? Yeah I ain't gonna be wealthy either, my parents are having a hard enough time just paying rent let alone groceries and helping me with school or trying to get me diagnosed and forget paying for any medication.  For fun? Nothings fun about this world.  Terrible people continue to run free from any guilt and any problems.  I've seen so many bad people get away with things and see no repercussions, and I try my best to be loyal and respectful to everyone (admittedly I fail for sure) but I try to be nice and I get the short end of the stick for trying to be a decent person.  

I'm convinced there's no good reason I should stay in this world, what logical sensical reasoning is there for enduring any more years of this?  I've lost so much and I don't want to throw myself a pity party, but everything's terrible.  My life has nothing going for it, no bright future, I'm not smart, I have a screwed up brain, living in a world where nobody cares about me, there's seriously no reason to keep going.

I don't know why I keep going, I guess part of me still has hope but I really think it would be better if I was dead.  The only ""enjoyment"" I get out of life is playing video games and half the time I don't even like playing games they're only a coping mechanism.  I always feel lonely no matter what anyone says.  I don't think I've loved anything or anyone since my dog passed.  I just don't want to kill myself because that would hurt my parents too much, I couldn't do that to them but I seriously don't see any other reason to keep going",1

"If I don't get sick, if I don't get murdered, if I don't starve to death, if I don't fucking do it myself

I just don't know if I have the strength to wait that long.

I just want to go to college. I don't want to have kids, I don't want to have a house someday, I don't even dream of having a nice car. I just to want to pursue a PhD man

I just want to go to school

Why do I hate other people so much? Why do I hate myself so much? Why am I getting worse *after* I pursue treatment? Why does ""getting a better idea of how I'm feeling"" just make things more painful and confusing?

I just want to go to school. I struggle to read now, I struggle to even eat or sleep if people don't remind me, but I am a master of acting completely fucking fine if anyone else asks. Forget high functioning, I'm high performative, and I can't stop acting...

I miss drugs. All they do is provide fresh new ways for me to experience self-hatred

Feels like self-harming is the only classic coping mechanism I haven't tried yet. Don't even have the courage to break the fucking meat puppet, but I'm so good at commanding it to pretend it's working. I try to tell people I don't know how to live anymore, but they're not seeing the bigger picture. Why is it so hard to figure out?? Who could be fucking happy with this world???

I don't even know how I can justify dreaming of a PhD. I have to finish my degree, I have to work and save, I have at least a master's and a doctoral program after that . . . that's hundreds of thousands of dollars and years and years and years and I don't know how to feed myself even with more money than I need

Why do I still think I'm worth that much? That anyone should think I'm worth that much? I can't fucking read anymore, my mind grabs the sentences and vomits them out, spits them back at me, and I'm soaked in bile on the first page after hours. Why the fuck would I be able to do this.

I don't have the fucking spine to end myself now, but how the fuck am I supposed to ""live for tomorrow"" when there could be so many more tomorrows",1
I'm tired of everything waiting for that one happy day out of the month I'm just tired. I'm here for everyone else still while being broken to pieces. Working the day after my rape bc my coworker friend encouraged me to continually struggling. Getting told to get over it 2 weeks after it happened by my coworker friend. Dragging myself out of bed just to work. Just to eat n go to bed. My hobbies don't make me happy anymore. The worst part is the false sense of happiness then being struck down again. I'm going to do something about it but idk when or how. ,1
"Since that day I have wanted to commit suicide. I know I am going to do it, but I don't know how or when. I have already started writing the letters I will leave behind for my loved ones. In total, I will write 10 letters, I am currently on the second one. Once l have finished writing them all, I will look for the method I prefer. I think that dying from an overdose is the best solution, but for now, I am not focusing on that.

"My life has plummeted to nothing and I think it‚Äôs time I just accept that I‚Äôm was born a coke baby and will stay a coke baby and will never be able to be enough for anything or anyone. Tonight was a wake up call that I‚Äôve gone past the point of no return. My mom finally got me to clean my room from staying in there, living and sleeping in there to avoid any interaction for weeks. There were bugs, spoiled food and wasted bags of chips that had gone stale. This isn‚Äôt how I was before, my life took a wrong turn and I‚Äôm putting a stop to it. My annual salary would get me 2 months rent in an apartment, and this ‚Äúbenefit‚Äù thing my parents are giving me won‚Äôt even let me have more than $2,000 in my name. I guess this is just game over now, I just need to know if jumping off the roof will suffice.

"I just finished my semester and i failed 3 of the 5 classes that i saw, i lost the right to the recovery exams, i don't know what i'll tell my parents, i feel like a failure bcs i actually did try to pass the semester and all came down to this. I asked some friends to help me study and they didn't do it. I don't even like that much this career, i like music but i'm not good enough for it, i don't sing very well and i lost ability in my guitar playing. I just think that i'm a waste of space, my parents waste money and reputation for me to fuck everything up, i don't have many real friends and i'm going nowhere with my career... i'm 23 and getting older and still haven't finished university.

I wasted so many opportunities for not caring about my future, for being scared that i'll fail, i just waited until i didn't had any chances left and now i'm here. I really don't think there's anything left for me, i don't think i'll kill myself bcs i'm to coward for that, but i sure do think i deserve it. I just don't want to keep going with this shit, i know how it will end, i'm tired of disappointing people.",1
"I feel very lonely, with no real activities apart from work. My debts consume most of my money. A year ago, the stress, depression, and frustration from not finding a job in my field despite having a degree, combined with the three-year struggle to get off a toxic job, the death tought who came back, and Hearing people complain about having a good life was difficult. I finally left a toxic job for a non-toxic that didn‚Äôt suit me. All of this piled up, and I cut off all contact. After three months, I received a few greetings and nothing more (six months later, one of them tried multiple times, but I didn't feel ready With my miserable life, I didn't want to reconnect until I had changed). I told myself that getting only two greetings in all that time showed I wasn't part of the group. most time ignored, I was more like a third wheel in a group of eight people for ten years (that's how I feel it).

Later, in November, a friend from another city came to mine and tried to get back on my feet. I engaged in activities, went out, tried dating apps, and had one date (I was super happy because, at my age (M27), it was my first date, despite many opportunities before). But the date was one-sided; she said yes but without enthusiasm, and I clung to it, seeking some love, though it was pointless. This improvement was short-lived. In January, I tried to enjoy my passion for photography, forced myself to improve, and reconnected with former colleagues and friends, though one had manipulative tendencies. I saw him as a male figure, in quotes. However, every time I posted a photo, he would call me on every platform possible (at least five calls), send messages everywhere, and leave comments. It was always to ask what was happening (related to the post). As an introvert, I didn‚Äôt like it; it made me feel watched 24/7. Another mistake I made was letting someone use my identity to find a job, adding stress at the end of each month because I didn't realize it would be automatically declared. So, I decided to cut connections, and since then, nothing. But my identity is still being used. A few days ago, I asked him via message to stop using it. He replied by sending an image and then deleting it before I could see it. I still have some hope because I changed my ID a few months ago, and the one he uses expires at the end of this month.

I already know that next year I'll owe taxes as if I were rich ( I prefer he stops using my ID and I pay the taxes than say it because if I do that I can lose everything, and I would probably need to fly away that country and never come back) while earning minimum wage with 28% of my salary going to debts each month. The government believes I earned double my actual salary because 2 minimum wages = rich enough. I have no contact with anyone; I feel alone. I have small projects and passions, but I can't motivate myself to pursue them. I wish I could succeed in motivating myself, stop putting myself in danger due to my altruism, make good friends and find a girlfriend in my city, and stop having failures like the rest of my life. I wanted to see a psychiatrist; I had one session but couldn't afford more. It put me in the red, and my employer's insurance is so poor that it doesn't cover what's usually reimbursed in my country, Im waiting for my refund so I can see my psychiatrist.

Every time I'm sad or angry, I remember all the times my mother told me I was useless, that I would never achieve anything, and that she hoped I would fail in life. All the time I stayed home because going out meant spending money for her. All the times I refused to go out with friends because I would be harassed on my phone ten minutes later, being told it was time to come home. Every time one of her acquaintances died, it was my fault. She even told me twice that I was worse than an accident worse than an unwanted, the worst thing that ever happened to her, and that she wished I had never existed. I knew I wasn't wanted but it was hard to hear that as a child, she bought me girls' stuff even though I am a boy. Ironically, she doesn‚Äôt like homosexuals! At one point, I believed I was a girl born in a boy's body(10\~\~14y). Around 15y, I started playing online games and met the group I cut off contact with last year. I desperately searched for a way to be loved, a way to forget, like adults drowning their sorrows in alcohol, but for me, it was in games.

I remember around 10 or 11, I wanted to end it. A friend at the time saw me and stopped me. Sometimes I think she shouldn't have intervened.

At 18, I left the country. After that, my mother would tell me she loved me and all, but she always had to remind me in every call that it was my fault for this, my fault for that. She also mentioned who would take care of her once she is too old (actually she is 66y) I suppose it will be my older brother (M38). My mother always called me by my brother‚Äôs name. I know she rarely called my brother by my name, but for me, it was all the time. My brother and I didn‚Äôt live together much; he lived with his father, and his life has also been pretty bad, but at least he is stronger than I am. And anyway, our last text was fine and you, fine thanks (mom and I).

My adult life has been socially challenging. I‚Äôve made some good friends (they live abroad), but I know it has directly impacted my adult life.

In 2021, I hit a shallow point and played with a knife, wanting to stab myself but couldn't do it. I promised myself that if I couldn't improve my life by 30, I would end it all. I don't see the point of living if it‚Äôs only to continue being rejected everywhere, never succeeding in anything, and being alone.

I know my life isn't the worst, but everyone manages it differently",1

I feel so fucking worthless, I don‚Äôt want to go back to the hospital, I don‚Äôt want help. I just want all of it to go away forever. My BPD is acting up really really bad. I can‚Äôt seem to go more than a day without SHing, I think everyone would be better off without me.

And now that my life has gotten a lot worse it feels like it‚Äôs finally time to do it. I‚Äôm just worried about hurting my family especially my younger brother who is only 13. And my friends they‚Äôll never forgive me. But I just can‚Äôt keep feeling this way. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore I just hurt so bad. Nothing helps. ,1
"I am 21 and already diagnosed with bpd, bp2, and awaiting a DID diagnosis. I am so exhausted. I constantly live in the past and relive through my trauma every single day to the point that i can no longer take care of myself. i've been depressed for years and started self harming a decade ago, at 11 years old. i've been waiting for it to get better but it just seems to get worse. i've tried every single medication from SSRIS to mood stabilizers to antipsychotics to benzos to self medication with psychedelics and weed. The only thing that helped with the suicidal thoughts was the psychedelics for a few years but they turned into a dependency and i would not like to try them again. I've been in and out of therapy since i was 8. I am so suicidal and tired and feel so trapped that i do not care that anyone will miss me so please don't tell me to stay here for selfish reasons, they will eventually be fine. My boyfriend today said it would kill him and my family but my dad died a few years ago and life goes on whether you like it or not and it gets better dealing with grief. I just can't seem to continue with my life anymore. I can't hold down a job and if i do i can't work for more than 3 days a week and i'm supposed to be going back to college this semester, i can't even take basic care of myself like remember to eat or drink water and my hair is matted because i don't have the energy to brush it. The only reason i will be okay tonight is because i am in my boyfriends bed and i will not let him the one to be finding my body. I've searched plans and every single one seems to have something wrong with it from organ failure to ending up in a coma/disabled. I do not have access to guns as i am legally not allowed to buy one in my state. No one seems to understand that i can't crawl myself out of this state of despair and every time i try to explain it i am called lazy or that i am overthinking things when i have lived enough trauma for multiple lifetimes. Please just offer quick and easy convenient ways to die, i dont care how painful as long as it is quick. Thank you. ",1
"The Hatred that is the Devil's love is the only love that's true,
(For) Where were you, O divine love, when everything cried for you?

My paths have gazed at your Minotaur like murderers with unpunished guilt,
(But)When was this life of mine, in this labyrinth, ever in need for you?

My sobriety left the day Spring arrived for you with its precious gifts, 
When was this Human Seed ever in need for you?

I implored you, my mother, but the Mountain gazed, gazed, and coerced you, 
When were you ever important when my Mind cried for you?

-----

Death makes for me a Heaven of nothingness that I so adore,
Why would I wait for miracles when the act of Dying itself is so?

The Mountains devoid of the Sun shine on the River crying floating death, 
Why should I bother staying?
Why musn't I not go?

The Queen of Life that is pending death calls for a gift wherefrom none escape, 
Why should I delay when all she wants is to make her love for me but known?",1
"It‚Äôs been a long road for me, but I feel like the end is near. At the age of 17, I tried to off myself with an IED style grenade (aerosol can on a fire). It backfired on me, quite literally. It left me with burns on my face and neck, and mental scars that will never go away. It haunts me every night, even to this day. At the age of 18, I tried with no success to get run over on the highway. People stopping because they see me laying there. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many times I end up in a psych ward, I always improve, but then tank back down. I‚Äôm 19 now and just got my first full time job, but I‚Äôm just sitting here waiting for the thoughts, because they always come back. Suicidal and homicidal. I‚Äôve always had the suicidal thoughts, but the homicidal ones are new. I don‚Äôt want to go back to the hospital to receive more help, because I‚Äôm scared my boss will fire me, as I am still in training. And therapy is just not enough support for me. I don‚Äôt know what to do. ",1
My rights will be taken away and the climate will become unbearable to live in. The same will happen to my closest friends. This is not life. It is better to be dead.,1
I made a post a few hours ago and now I've decided to put my plan in motion. I'm going to kill myself. Goodbye ,1
Will it work and be very painful? I can't take it anymore. ,1
"I'm probably not be here anymore when someone read this, but this subreddit is like reflection of what I'm going through, I know this might be hypocrite of me saying this but someone might be out there waiting for me healing and loving me, someone might be out there going through the same thing as me or worse than me. 
Your reactions are valid or actions rather you're not the best piece of society might be dreamed of but you're perfect fit for someone else for yourself. 

I can't deny that life has sorted me out in a fucked up way, or maybe I'm too nueurodivergent to understand that I'm not special like my parents describe me to be. We're not fit into space where we are judged for being who we are. We wanted to be normal but we can't help it. We were just not wired for things that's considered and deemed as normal. 

We're weird crazy and so much other things that people describe us but who are we really? I come to the conclusion we don't knew ourselves we are so lost. We were just a kid who have the hope and cling to the promises that we might change the world someday. 

Please don't be like me, Dont be a frustrated daydreamer and a procrastinator. I've done enough self sabotage that I can't bounce back. Someone might say you can do it, I did it myself too. They're not on your shoes they never knew how much you suffer enough to be accepted for who you're or how much you suffer to be deemed as normal. 

It might be ironic and humorous cause I myself suffered and ending it today. But I hope for someone like you who read this, Tell the world to fuck it and shut thier mouth. ",1

"if i find it in me to kms tonight, this'll be my suicide note. i just wanted someone to know what i feel. i'm so alone. such an empty feeling.


""I woke up In the morning and I didn't want anything, didn't do anything, couldn't do It anyway, just lay there listening to the blood rush through me and It never made any sense, anything.""

the sound of my breath, the feeling of my pulse, it's nauseating, all of it.

it's gnawing to exist.

i told my sister i was going to kill myself tonight, but she never responded. so i just deleted the messages to save myself the embarrassment.

i really am the scum of life, not even my own family wants to help me.

i'm so pathetic, i can't take living anymore.

i just want to feel okay again.

i want to listen to nirvana all day and sleep like a baby again. but lying down makes my ribs scrape against the insides my skin, piercing, and it's uncomfortable. 

so i haven't slept that much over these past days.

i feel so lightheaded all of the time, i just want it to stop already. 

i want to feel good, i want to go to school next month and be okay again. 

but i feel as if it's too late for me now.

14 years, yet It feels as If I have been alive for all eternity, excruciatingly.

it's harrowing to have to breathe to survive, to keep my blood pumping through my body, through the tips of my fingers.

i can't handle being this person anymore.

to live the life of a human being anymore.

no one, floating aimlessly through life without purpose or reason.

i'll extend my hand, but no one will take it,

to intertwine their fingers with mine, 

to tell me it'll all be okay again.

no one will bother to help me, no one no one no one.

am i really such a burden?

why must i be so hard to love, why was i born in the first place? nothing.

oh, what a shame it is to be me. i'll cry out against my existence, but i'll still be here. 

nothing, excruciating.

""I shall be nothing, the wind, the sky.""

the texture, the taste, the smell, no motivation, no incentive to do anything anymore.

as i am writing this, i feel so lightheaded, and it's unbearable to even breathe. 

such a strange feeling, to exist.

oppressing, harrowing, incomprehensible.

i feel my heart beat from the inside of my throat, and i feel sickened when i press my fingers against it, to feel it pulsate beneath.

i look into the mirror, and all that looks back is a person who has lost everything.

i miss having the luxury to enjoy life.

it's too late though. i feel too far gone. 

i can't find a reason to be much longer; no desire or hope to live, nothing but the blankness of death after.

""There's nothing worth pursuing at the cost of prolonging a life of suffering.""

i'm so scared of the pain though, that i'm starting to second-guess myself.

i hope it'll snap my neck. i don't want to have to die a slow and suffocating death.

that's what i fear the most, the pain that'll follow death.

why is it so hard to just die painlessly and instantly? 

what a pathetic life i have made for myself,

what a pathetic excuse of a human being.

i truly am nothing to this world.

 it's unbearable to think anymore, to feel anything at all anymore. 

excruciating, nothing.

i just want to fade out of existence so i won't have to think about anything anymore. 

Thinking Is exhausting, and I just want to rest already. 

""Wake me from this oxidizing world of a dream.""",1
"I have felt so alone and depressed and had some I guess ""pre"" suicidal thoughts for the past 5 months or so and now am actually thinking and looking up ways how to do it... I not only hate myself now but am also scared of myself, making me hate myself even more. Ive tried so hard to pretend I'm okay and forget my issues and stressor but it never works and tried kind of talking to a few people buy I feel no one cares or really pays attention or takes me seriously. I have been recently hurt and feel betrayed by people I have thought were friends so can't really talk to them and my parents are getting pretty old and can't feel like I can have a basic conversation with them let alone a complicated one about my mental health. I have to go into work everyday and face people that have purposely hurt me and it eats at me every time I see them especially the girl I thought I loved. And I cant just easily get another job that pays enough because of my legal past which eats me alive everyday. God i f***ing hate myself. I feel so alone and hurt but also feel like a baby and selfish for feeling this way. I feel sick every morning just because the fact I even woke up. I honestly don't know how many more days or even hours I can do this.",1
"i hate how i give my love and appreciation to people just for them to use it against me in the future. i wish i didn‚Äôt care what others thought of me. i wish i didn‚Äôt have to try so hard just to be accepted by the people i want to be around. i don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me, it‚Äôs this cycle that doesn‚Äôt stop. yes i‚Äôm only 19 but i feel so low. it‚Äôs been going on like this since elementary school. i just want to move out and move to another state and restart my life. i don‚Äôt know, i just feel that if i weren‚Äôt myself, someone else, then i‚Äôd be perfectly happy. i don‚Äôt know if these feelings will ever stop.

i feel like shit no matter what and idk what to do,1
