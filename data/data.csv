"Recently after joining this sub, I‚Äôve realized that i have a functional depression. I still need meds and help and so on, but i can relatively function normally. Most people i know dont know about my depression. My question is why is it that way? Some people can barley get out of bed (which is me sometimes) while others continue to go on with their lives. Idc if this is dumb but im curious",0
Most people who fail in school have a good social life. And most people who fail to have a social life do well in school. Most people succeed in both.  I somehow managed to fail in both and now i‚Äôm a complete fucking loser,0
Life is meaningless and I don‚Äôt want to do it anymore. ,0
"hey guys, f 25 here. when will life ever get better? i‚Äôm so tired of waiting. everyday is a bad day. i‚Äôve struggled with depression since probably around 21. i have a good car, not broke, have a house but yet so broken inside. i feel like an ungrateful brat, who appreciates no one, or anything i have. i also had an abortion in January, wrecked me more so. i just can‚Äôt. i just wanna be happy. i don‚Äôt know how much longer i can go ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π",0
"There‚Äôs nothing to look forward to, the only time I ever feel calm is when I lay down and imagine I was dead. I destroy everyone around me. And I truly think I was supposed to die in 2010 when I almost did. Every moment of my life has been agony and I‚Äôm 32. Chronically ill &amp; getting worse. The people who stopped me before don‚Äôt exist in my life now or are better off without me. I deactivated all my accounts. I wanted to sell all my stuff before but I don‚Äôt even have the energy for that. Idk why I‚ÄômPosting here - maybe for encouragement as I‚Äôm a terrible coward and haven‚Äôt ever been able to do it ",0
"I can‚Äôt even eat. Very close to loosing my job. Meds and therapy don‚Äôt work. Live alone and no one would even know if I died. Kept functional for years for my son. Now that he is all grown up and busy in his life, I have no reason to live or do anything. Yes I would love to be around just in case my son would need me‚Ä¶ but now it‚Äôs so very hard. Every minute is misery.. you don‚Äôt need to die to go to hell. I‚Äôm in it.",0
"Just have this horrible feeling like I would be loved more if I was not alive. Like I would be appreciated more and thought of positive and more often if I just went out with a ""bang"".Sucks",0
"I‚Äôm 20 I have no social life and live a really terrible, lone≈Çyl life. I detest looking at myself, and I wish I wasn't such a faiIure. I do not have any family or friends at all.I've never had a Gir≈Çfrienƒèl before, and I feel as if I'm just existing among people but not being seen, and I feel so alone because I suffer from social anxiety and autism. I too feel like an outsider.Loneliness has taken over my life. For the past year, I've been attempting to change. I've gone to social events such as groups, bars, and other public places, but I've never had success. Rather, I simply go to college, return home, and do it all over.Then I attempted online dating, which is challenging even though there were no matches. It doesn't help that my family doesn't really want me around, I don't really have family that I can spend time with.I believe that there is nothing left for me in this world, and that in the near future, only loneliness and unhappiness will exist for me. I appreciate you reading, and I wish you happiness in life.",0
"i cant do this anymore. nothing in my life is working. my entire life has been a series of unfortunate events. i have nothing and no one. my parents are narcissists. i have no money. my car is owed 4k that i dont have. i live with my divorced parents and im 34. i have no goals, barely any friends, no on i can rely on.i had the perfect situation. i had an amazing partner who was in law school. we had our little family with our dogs. i pushed her away and she blocked me everywhere. she discarded me like a piece of trash. im alone crying. SSRIs no longer work. i really dont see the point of any of this anymore. i want to shoot myself in the head in front of my ex's car. i fucking hate her ",0
I have no will to to do anything. I don't want to live in this evil world. GOD please take me. Lost my job due to depression. Depression made my IQ low. I have no friends. I just rot in bed all day.,0
"When I was 21, I lost my best friend of 10 years to suicide. I could hardly deal with the pain, I was going to college for a chemistry degree but I abandoned that plan entirely because I couldn't focus. It took a couple of years to get myself together enough to find a job and start living my life again. Fast forward to 26, I was in a very happy mindset. I've been doing well on my own, paying bills with no problem and being generally content. I had another best friend. Someone I could talk to daily and be captivated by every word she said. For the better part of 2 years, I shared my daily life with her. You probably see where this is going, but 3 weeks ago I got a suicide text from her. And I haven't heard from her since. I don't know what I plan to gain by posting this. All I know is it's very hard for me to make connections to such a level. And if I'm going to take a loss like this every few years of my adult life, it feels entirely pointless to try. I think I'm just the kind of person who dies alone. ",0
"Im diagnosed with depression for more than 4 years, I struggle with it for last 6 to 7 years. It gets worse and worse with every month, week, day. Im getting older, but im more and more useless, I can't work, go to school like a normal person, I can't keep up with normal people, im just unfit to do anything. How is it possible for me to go through life like this? Why am i like this? Why cant i be normal? Why me?",0
"Like the title says, i feel unlovable. For some context, i am a highly functioning autistic 19 year old male. I'm overweight, but currently on a weight loss journey. For all of my life i have always been the bully victim at worst, and a backup/2nd choice at best. I've never had many friends. I currently only have one, and i know it's just a matter of time before he leaves too.   It all started 4 years ago when i was 15. I got into a fight with a friend and the entire friend group at the time decided to ditch me then and there. I was then alone and bullied for the next 2 years.   I also at this time found a girlfriend. She left me not too long after and it didnt help my case. I have been to multiple psychiatrists, received multiple diagnoses, and have gotten countless of ""just go outside! youll feel much better"".  It all just breaks me down and i cant ever seem to win in any situation im in. Even now as im typing this im worried im making no sense and its all confusing, if so, im sorry for that.  I had to drop out of school because of a suicide attempt and me just generally hating life and since then, ive just stayed at home, doing nothing. My parents havent told me anything yet but i know for a fact they despise me doing this. I have two siblings and i 100% know that im the least favorite out of all of us.  I'm bad at social stuff. i have a severe stutter so any attempt at gaining confidence gets shut down immediately. I get easily angry at people better looking than me, more successful than me, and just people in general who i deem to be ""better"" than me. I could never ever in my life imaging a girl genuinely liking me, and like i said, it makes me feel unlovable. I feel like a failure of a human being and my suicide attempt should have worked out. I genuinely don't know what to do, and i dont expect anyone to give me any solutions, i just needed to vent as i have no one else to vent to. lmao, isnt that just pathetic? Im opening up about my feelings to a random internet forum instead of telling my ""nearest and dearest"" whoever the fuck they could be. Anyways, thanks for listening i guess, cheers.TLDR: I kinda suck at life",0

"It feels like I just hate myself for even existing. It doesn‚Äôt matter what I do or achieve, I‚Äôll barely acknowledge my accomplishments, but if I mess up once, just once‚Ä¶ whether it‚Äôs big or small, I completely lose it.  if someone reassures me that everything is fine it just further engraves into my mind that I fucked up. I don‚Äôt get how others are just capable of forgetting and moving on.I fucking hate, I feel like a miserable piece of shit that should crawl in to a hole and die without ever being seen again. A loser like me isn‚Äôt capable of surviving on his own.",0
Used to beat myself with a metal rod or punch my face for like one year. Then today i first cut myself in the chest 6times so that no one can see it. And i feel sooo happy after that. I am planning to catch the bus in late august. Trust me when i say this there‚Äôs no help for me tried everything.,0
"I don't even know why I'm still alive, I don't have the energy to do anything, nothing excites me.I'm in college and considering to drop out because I'm just wasting my time here no matter how much I concentrate, I can't focus.From the past 6 months I tried to be rude to my parents, so they hate me and when I kill myself they don't feel much sad but my parents always been sweat no matter how rude I've behaved they always responded with love and that's the only thing that is keeping me alive.I've tried therapy but it's not helping much I feel nothing can help me anymore.I've turned 23 today, I was sitting in my room crying like loser, I have no friends and people in my collage thinks I'm freak because they have seen scars on my arm.Thank you for reading, have a great day.",0
Have been waiting to cease to exist for a long time now but keep waking up. Don‚Äôt want to die painfully as life is already painful enough. My life is deteriorated along with my increasing depression. If I‚Äôm ‚Äúsupposed to‚Äù live for another 45 years the loneliness is eating me. Can‚Äôt wrap my head around bringing someone else into my miserable life. Always wanted kids but why bring this burden onto someone else? What do you do?,0
"I‚Äôm 20 married with a baby. Got married after we found out I was pregnant because we‚Äôre both military. Husband is full time and i‚Äôm part time. My family is very proud of me because i‚Äôm in school, raising a son, in the military and married (which is an accomplishment because I come from a line of unmarried women) My husband does know about my history of depression. The truth is that i‚Äôm so overwhelmed with everything in my life and sometimes I just shut down. My family doesn‚Äôt know this because every time i‚Äôm around them I put on a mask to convince them i‚Äôm fine but i‚Äôm really not.I just don‚Äôt want them to be disappointed in me and i‚Äôm scared.My husband usually keeps his gun in our room and today I asked him if he could remove it away from me because I had some thoughts of hurting myself. I‚Äôm just struggling so bad mentally and I don‚Äôt know what to do. My husband told me that now he‚Äôs uncomfortable with leaving me alone with our son since when i‚Äôm upset I throw things and stuff. But I would never hurt my baby, it‚Äôs myself that I want to hurt. I just feel like I made the right choices in life but at the wrong time.I‚Äôve gotten a referral for therapy from my doctor but it took me months to get an appointment and by the time the appointment came, I felt fine so I ended up not going.",0
"Was abused growing by many different people. Bullies, teacher, family and neighbors all the way until highschool. Got a little tougher then the girl problems began. Always started good then would fall apart. I rarley was the one who left and they would all cheat on me. Betrayals galore which brought me down pretty hard. Doing business with brothers and would be robbed of what i was owed after also withholding the money for an entire year. This is not detailed at all. Just dont want to write forever. Im at a point where i have no friends anymore, dont talk to my brothers or thier kids, cousins and uncles hate my guts. I cant make new friends or get a gf because my anger for people is insane. I cant be near people without trolling them to hell.. No clue why i do this, to push them away? This just sucks and im so sad that i dont know what to do anymore. ",0
"Hi, my name is Treethorn. I'm new to Reddit and suffer from major depression. I'm not sure what the self-introduction protocol is around here, but this is my attempt (tried to post a few days ago, but didn't have enough karma apparently).I'm now 57 and have been dealing with depression since my early teens. All I do is sleep and lie in bed looking at escapist distractions on the internet. I never leave the house, rarely leave or clean my room, and have no money, no prospects. I feel utterly defeated and sick with self-loathing, as though there's nothing left for me in life. I think frequently about killing myself.Fwiw, I am medicated. I take citalopram and bupropion. They help mitigate the worst of my symptoms, but I'm still essentially dead inside. I haven't held a job in two years and am horribly lonely. Late last year, I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation and subsequently spent some time homeless, though I now have a stable living situation. While I have self-harmed, I have never attempted suicide in earnest.My only goal in life is to own a cat. I'm too poor for that now. Any/all feedback appreciated.",0
I feel like all I do is disappoint everyone no matter what I do. I am a cook and love it but I work in two different kitchens for 2 different companies and I feel like I don‚Äôt enjoy anything anymore. I am constantly being yelled at at one place or the other and it‚Äôs so draining. I try and cope with dark humor and most people find it funny but what if they go to hr and then I get in more trouble. I work so damn hard and I don‚Äôt get any credit or recognition I feel like I am a failure.,0
"Wellbutrin worked on giving me (19f) a sex drive, but wasn't helping me with my depression. I am currently on Zoloft and now I feel almost asexual. Is there anything I can do to combat this lowered libido?",0
"I (20F) feel like i don‚Äôt have any energy left for life which is strange because im only 20. I do have a history of struggling with my mental health and only recently have I been able to function a bit better. I often get a sudden feeling of dread when i think about life. I can‚Äôt help but feel very depressed when i think about the future or even the present. I live in a third world country that just keeps getting worse politically and economically. I am ambitious and wish to accomplish my academic goals but I can‚Äôt put in the effort that is needed for that. I guess that just means I yearn to learn and accomplish. Worrying about money has become an every day thing for me even though me have a good family income (middle class) My dysfunctional family also wears me down. I am getting therapy which is working in some areas but I still seem to be stuck. Even if I somehow convince myself to be optimistic about my future and about potentially going abroad for education, my family bursts that bubble by telling me they won‚Äôt allow that. It makes me feel stupid about wanting something like that in the first place. Like i‚Äôm not worthy or capable enough for that. Other than that, I feel very hopeless about the prospect of finding someone i like and who likes me back and is a good person. I just feel like i can only see people live a good life from far away but i cannot be a part of that. Oh, and i feel horribly guilty when i say this because there are so many people in the world going through absolute worst circumstances so it does not make sense for me to whine about this but i cannot control my honest feelings, can i?",0
"I have seen some videos talking about it and I have seen many people across internet saying they are ready to let this world we live in go. Specially when people talk about end of the world theories and many issues the current world has and faces as a whole, this is why I wonder if it is the case, personally I am both scared and worried about what something like that would mean to me, so I choose not to commit suicide, but I get more people don't feel like they have a way out and I have been thinking about it for some time.

"I‚Äôm a 19 year old girl and I think about dying a lot. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm suicidal as I don‚Äôt think I would kill myself but I do think about it a lot, like driving my car into a tree or over a bridge or overdosing on pills but I wouldn‚Äôt really do it. I just feel like sometimes that it would be good to die but I wouldn‚Äôt do it myself. I guess  wouldn‚Äôt mind if it was an accident but I just wouldn‚Äôt do it. I realise that this line of thinking isn‚Äôt normal and that there is something wrong with me but I don‚Äôt feel suicidal. I don‚Äôt really know what to do or how to fix those thoughts. ",0
"I'm just tired of this goddamn world, everyone is pushing forwards while im here doing no useful shit but just existing, i lost joy in my things i loved... i simply want to stay at my room talking to no one and it makes me feel like shit.

"My life is currently a joke right now and I'm trying to do anything to improve it but so far it's gotten me no where. I'm trying to study for my A+ certificate because I'm trying to apply for a tech job and I'm studying because apparently obtaining an ITF plus isn't enough. I've also tried reconnecting with my siblings, but that only lead to no responses from my brother and a huge fight with my sister. Plus I tried cutting my mother out of my life due to her abusive behavior and I thought it would solve my problems but never did, considering how my upbringing has negatively affected my adulthood. I'm also autistic with bipolar, but I could never get rid of my mood swings no matter how much I try. So instead of trying to please people that won't do a fucking thing for me, I just isolate myself in my apartment, smoke weed, and browse on my PC or play games on it. It's the only thing that I feel like doing anymore, and I'm a 31 year old autistic man with practically nothing to live for. ",0
"I wear the same clothes for longer and working from home allows me to get away with it. I haven't showered for four weeks,  only being in a swimming pool at weekends with the kids.

I really don't know what to do anymore. July has been awful to not only me but my family. Finally after 4 weeks of hell two members of my family shared good news with me and I just feel numb I literally feel nothing at all. I just paint on a happy face and then cry when I'm alone away from my partner and child. I can't go on like this but I also can't tell people I'm not ok and I'm not coping because then I become that person that buts the burden on there good news and brings everyone down and I just can't be that person . I can't even talk to my partner becaus when I try he tells me I'm wrong to feel the way I do. He just doesn't understand. My head is a mess and I really don't know what to do. ,0
"Nothing ever goes right. Not sure if it‚Äôs just that I suck that much at everything or if it‚Äôs a mixture of bad luck. I never get a good break when it actually matters or the situation has any actual significance. I got pretty close to having a shot at my dreams but idk I kinda fucked up and the added stress of my mom clinging on to control of my life made it impossible. Not only did I watch my dreams crash and burn, but also my backup plan got crushed literally when I got hurt at work. I‚Äôm smart enough to learn how to do stuff, but don‚Äôt really have any skills that can get me a job above minimum wage now that I might not even be able to stand for extended periods. I have to restart my life at 27 and after two years of struggling/fighting with work comp and my settlement isn‚Äôt even going to be enough to put a down payment on a decent used car lol I was miserable before but now I don‚Äôt even want to leave my bed. I‚Äôm not really asking for sympathy nor do I think I deserve it because yes I had a rough childhood but I choked or fucked up every opportunity I had in life before I got hurt anyways which is why I was working that not so great job anyways. Idk I don‚Äôt feel very human anymore. I‚Äôm a shell. I don‚Äôt know who or what I am or if I am really anything at all. I want to not be here but not aliving myself would just hurt the few people who kinda care about me so I can‚Äôt. ",0
"I‚Äôve gone to five different therapists. According to my psychiatrist, I‚Äôve tried every conventional medication and combination of medications to treat depression.

"Im wondering if anyone else has experienced this?The past few weeks depression has gotten real bad. When im at home, ive been isolating myself in my room. Just lying in bed. Usually feeling awful and crying. But last night, something just, snapped. I cant explain it.I still couldnt shake the awful thoughts and feelings, but rather than zero energy and willpower, i was up and bouncing around, also i could not control my laughter. I felt light as a feather. Everytime awful thoughts flooded my head, i simply laughed. But i still felt really bad inside. When i look at my SH spots, i usually spiral further. But last night, i still felt like spiraling, but couldnt stop laughing instead of crying.Ive never experienced this before. This definitely doesnt feel normal and it feels like im going insane.",0
"I've been out of work for about a month now because HR were d\*cks and I just got my unemployment. but for the longest time my boyfriend as been using me as a piggy bank. I know he says he isn't but I've been helping his rent for so long it just hurts and when I want to buy something like doodash he makes me feel guilty about it. I've putt a lot of money into him and he never does for me a lot. I just feel so lost because I love him so much but I just feel like nothing to him. either someone he's next to bed, or just a roommate. I just want us to be happy but I can't due to the guilty feeling of wanting to spend like a little but of money.   I take therapy every Tuesday and its cab up, but he makes me feel bad for getting that or a $3 soda when im done my session. I grew up with money always being tight so I understand the savings aspect but when I want to he says we have bills to pay and when I do. we split the rent three ways with his dad but he never comes up with his half. why do I cry everything this happens I just want him to find work and be happy but I'm not. I paid his rent, paid his phone bill one month so I count pay mine till a week later. and whenever I ask for the money back he waits till something big happens.am I worthless? I can't say no a lot and the one time when he asked me money for weed it turned into a big fight. how come I have to do everything while he sits on his ass and plays bloodborne.   he also doesn't like to do things with me unless im upset and when I agree and want to do things he says that we can do together he says he's to tired for it now. I'm sorry for venting about this but somedays I can't talk to both my therapist and my mother about it and I just feel so alone, thank you for anyone listening.",0
"Am I the only one who feels like this?My heart feels sore from being in this state. It's probably an exaggeration. But it feels like that. It feels like it has been put on a fridge. You know that feeling when you touch something frozen and your fingers feel numb and hurt you? My heart feels like that. There are times also when I feel like actually something pokes/stings me in my heart, when I'm really overwhelmed sometimes it feels like that.Most of the time, I feel the heaviness on my chest.Sometimes it feels like rusty iron and rotten.I just wanted to share this post about how my heart physically feels with this crap. It's sickening and tiring.Don't worry about anything physical.

"Hello Everyone, First of all, I hope you're all doing great.I (F/29) am having a rather hard time mentally these past few weeks, since I'm struggling with feelings of loneliness, emotional neglect, depression (I think) and just a sense of not being important in relation to my family (mother &amp; younger brother).Most of the struggles I am currently still going through, is related to a sudden MS Diagnosis I received almost exactly a year ago &amp; multiple other smaller health issus that had to be taken care of &amp; addressed until recently.Since I've always been rather athletic and took care of my health meticulously since my teenage years, all these sudden health issues felt like life was playing a bad joke on me.In addition to that, I didn't have a full time job (just part-time), since my diagnosis, because it happend right after graduating from college and everything just hit me like a train.My mother, has supported me financially throughout this time and I am extremely grateful for her helping me out and promised to pay her back in thime (I always keep my word, I think it's only fair). Currently I am applying for full-time positions in my field again, because the financial burden has become to great for my mother (understandably) and I also only want to live a normal life again and get back on track.Now just earlier, I talked with my mom on the phone and had gotten really emotional, communicating that I had suicidal ideations after her constant harsh treatment towards me (telling me I need to learn to deal with everything on my own and not look for emotional support in regards to my MS etc.) and that I didn't understand why - or felt like they don't take my illness seriously (fatigue - especially in this summer heat, numb &amp; painful hand, fear of the future etc.). She answered in her usual way of saying that she didn't want to talk &amp; that it is my decision to end my life - nothing she can do about it.My brother, unfortunately also leans towards a rather stoic and emotionless respons in situations where I would appreciate some kind words. That's all I want. Not to be kicked when I already feel at my lowest... This is not the first time, she told me this, when I communicated my hurts to her, and it freaking hurts like hell when she talks to me in this way.  I pushed myself through so many appointments for an entire year, without having any help or assistance from anyone.I live alone, my apartment is spotless, I'm trying to get my energy back and am working with a great neurologist to get my energy levels back again after all these medical precedures etc.I'm taking part in a research study for future MS treatments and applying for jobs again.I communicated to my family that I would appreciated them visiting or at least calling me more &amp; asking how I'm doing, but they just don't get it. They just don't seem to care or see what I have gone through or how much effort I put into things - trying to fix my life again.My mother told me today, that:""You're not sick. You can still do everything as before.""I AM SICK - I PUSH THROUGH SO NO ONE SEES HOW FREAKING TIRED &amp; FATIGUED I AM ALL OF THE TIME! SO EVERYONE KEEPS FEELING COMFORTABLE SINCE APPARENTLY THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH PEOPLE HAVING A HARD TIME OR BEING SAD ONCE DURING A FULL MOON OR FEELING LONELY SINCE NO ONE COMES TO VISIT FOR 5 MONTHS! (Sorry about that...)Even hours of talking on the phone and trying to explain myself is a lost cause and only ends up in me being gaslit &amp; putting all of the emotional responsibilities onto me again. I guess we actually don't need any human connection or support when I apply the logic of my family.I'm not so delusional to think that I won't reclaim the life that I want and always strived for. I just had bad luck for a bit over a year I suppose. It happens. The only thing I need &amp; actually always wanted, is being heard, loved and just seen for who I am, what I feel and how I experience my reality. It just feels like I can scream as loud as I want &amp; cry as much as I want and no one is listening. I'm so exhausted.I just want a hug.How the hell do you deal with life while feeling unheard and emotionally abandoned?",0
"At this point i just want to end it its so unbearable im just in agony its been going on for 4 years. I am not social dont know how to talk to people, spend most of my days alone.

Lately ive been thinking about ending it because i really cant be living like this anymore i cant remember the last time i enjoyed existing.

"My first memory (either 2 or 3 years old) is a screaming match between my mom and dad, after which, my dad left in his car for several hours and I believed he was never coming home again. While he was a good father in other ways, it doesn't excuse the selfish and childlike behavior my dad subjected me and my family to growing up. Of all the memories I have of my dad, the ones that are most prominent and stand out the most are of him screaming at me, belittling me, only to sweep it under the rug a day or so later with some bullshit apology and a present to buy my apology. Additionally, he neglected to socialize me almost entirely, making it so that I basically had to develop all my social skills from scratch *way* later than my peers. This is how I learned to always be incredibly submissive to the wants and anger of other people, leading me down a childhood/adolescence of bullying, isolation, depression, and (the worst in my opinion) depersonalization/lack of identity. To cope I became a chameleon, adopting the personality of those around me with truly no inherent grasp of my own. Besides my lack of social ability as a child, I was bullied and tormented by others because of reasons beyond my control, namely racism and people who told their children to dislike me because of my family. In school I was incredibly studious and tried to be kind to everyone. That never helped at all. It was constant torment, (never physical, just emotional) as I was meticulously pulled apart by people because I was different. While I was able to have a handful of friends, bad luck resulted in every friend I made moving away by the point I had entered middle school. I was incredibly lonely, and basically just drifted those few years. Once in high school, I made it my mission to join what I saw as the popular crew (keep in mind, what I *saw* as lack of any social skills blinded me to the fact that these guys were the worst douchebags and everyone hated them). To do this, I basically hung around long enough to the point where I was just part of the group by association, even though it basically meant I was their punching bag for verbal abuse and always being the butt of the joke. My positive memories with them have nothing to do with anything good happening, just being moments where they didn't tear me to shreds with their words. But being around the group made people dislike me more by associate because they disliked these guys for being total jerks. So essentially, not only was I getting bullied more regularly and intensely now, but everyone else hated me because they thought I was like them. For sake of not making this incredibly long, I'm skipping over a lot of detail and nuance. But after high school, my life began to improve dramatically. I made better friend groups with people who actually were kind to me and friendly, I went to college and began to discover myself, all was well. And then covid hit and we all went home and I lost all my newly gained friends. And I was back at home, alone. At that point I was at the roughest point in my life. It was like I had finally been given a taste of what having fun and being young was about, and it was ripped away from me almost instantly. Even once I returned to college, my core friend group just sort of fell apart and didn't hang out, and I spent most of my time in my dorm (still covid so couldn't go into common area and meet people) by myself doing drugs and playing video games. I barely made it through the semester and honestly was probably on track to dropping out the next simply because of how unhappy and riddled with depression I was. Over break, I met someone through mutual friends and we instantly fell for each other. She was my first significant other, even counting all the lame middle/high school relationships which I was never a part of. We were so in love. And it was good, and compassionate, and caring, and respectful. She was a shining beam of light in my life that I never had before and she validated all the struggle and pain I went through in my life. I was able to tell her about myself, and she, also coming from a place of incredible trauma, was able to truly relate and understand me. It was the first time in my life I felt I ever had anyone genuinely know and care about me as a person. While part of me was just okay with having someone to make my deep seated insecurities pushed to the side, I know that this was actually true love and I was truly happy with her. We were even having talks about potentially buying a house and getting married.We stayed together through the remainder of college, during which my grades improved drastically. After graduating, after we had been together many years, our relationship ended in a hellish fireball I never saw coming. In the span of a few months we went from ""perfect"" to horribly toxic. She left me, lied to me, took advantage of me financially, abused me emotionally, used things I told her in confidence against me, and cheated on me. I did everything I could to repair the damage as it happened but it was gone and destroyed. I begged to fix things and try to patch things up but she treated me like garbage, like I was a stranger and didn't know her. In the many months after, I was horribly depressed and suicidal. I honestly don't know how I made it through everything I did all alone (I should add, during/after my relationship I had lost nearly all my friends, some through falling outs, some as they were originally hers, but mostly just through growing up and having our own lives). I focused on myself and my career and was able to make it through, as difficult as it was. I recognized looking back obvious red flags in our relationship which I had thought of as minor road bumps we could conquer together initially. I don't want her back now, and I would never let her back into my life. But in all honesty, those years with her were the happiest years of my life by far, and nothing even remotely compares to it. When I look back at my life, even with consideration that those years were the most recent, they make up the overwhelming majority of truly happy memories in my lifetime. So now we reach my current life. I am at a great job with great pay and great potential to move into other positions making incredible money, not just for someone my age, but great for anyone. I have an apartment in a good neighborhood where I live peacefully and make myself healthy food and life an overall good life from an outward perspective. But internally I'm dead inside. I have a toxic family dynamic, no real friends, and no longer any significant other in my life. The irony is, that even now, as lonely as I am, when I reach out for any of those categories I get a full dose of either shitty parenting, shitty friends, or shitty situation ships where I don't even care about the other person. It's like I'm a ping pong ball caught between being lonely or dealing with horrible people as I just can't seem to find someone who is tolerable (ie: doesn't abuse me and actually wants to spend time with me \[impossible combo\]). The only feelings I have are complete numbness and then random bouts of horrible despair and depression where whatever I'm doing comes to a complete halt as I mentally deal with it to prevent from spiraling. On occasion I feel incredibly manic (I'm going to conquer the world, become a billionaire, etc. etc.) which usually is quickly followed by more depression. This can all occur on a daily basis. I have to gaslight myself to get anything done. I'd say I'm fairly productive, but unless I trick myself into performing basic self care, things won't get done. Even in moving on, my current trauma and pathetic social skills (note how I don't say shyness, I really mean social skills) put a strong buffer on my ability to build new relationships. I think the worst thing of all is that I truly loved and still do love all the horrible people in my life. I've always just wished they would accept me, and I could never understand the reasoning why not. I don't know why I still feel drawn to many of these people, as many of them were actually terrible and took full advantage of me. Yet I just have that wish to be loved and this pain of rejection that I wish above all else they would just love me. I have been to therapy, but it didn't help. I plan on returning with someone new, but I am just so tired all the time. As stupid as it sounds, I wish I could just wish there to be a single person in my life who would hold my hand (literally and metaphorically) when life gets tough and guide me along. I wish there was someone who I could place my absolute faith in without the constant fear that they would undercut me and leave me for dead. I wish there was someone who, when they tell me something, I can believe it without knowing they are a liar. I know it's possible for someone to be this person, because I've been this person in nearly all the relationships throughout my life. But for now I keep going because there's nothing else to do. I don't plan on going anywhere, even though I am not hopeful. I do my best to improve myself in whatever ways I can. And I do continue to try to reach out to people, even though stuff never works out at all. Even posting this, in a way, is really just a way for me to get some of the social interaction I'm lacking. I hope if you're reading this and you can relate that you've gotten better/are in the process of getting better. ",0
I hate life and I don't remember  what happiness feels like,0
"I don‚Äôt want to work anymore. I don‚Äôt want to learn anything new. I don‚Äôt want to go anywhere. Getting through a conversation with anyone is like pulling teeth. I just simply don‚Äôt care anymore. Am I selfish? Am I fucking crazy? I don‚Äôt put the effort into friendships anymore. My relationship with my partner is circling the drain. No one genuinely asks the question ‚Äòhow have you been lately?‚Äô And genuinely listens to how you‚Äôve been. I‚Äôm not enough and I‚Äôve never felt like I was enough. Childhood trauma keeps a hand on my shoulder no matter how much healing and working through things I do. Life doesn‚Äôt get any better regardless of how many times I pick myself up and convince myself that‚Äôs it‚Äôs going to be ok. Life is tough, I‚Äôve known that since I can remember holding conscious thoughts. I‚Äôm almost 30 years old is it some sort of crisis? Will I snap out of it? I made diet changes, and lifestyle changes years ago. I gave up alcohol over a year ago. I‚Äôm honest, probably to a fault sometimes. Why can‚Äôt I shake this feeling of not good enough, not doing enough, you‚Äôll never be happy. What is happy? How do I find it? These questions are rhetorical.

"I have no hope for the future honestly. I dont even care about being poor or working, or the state of the world really at this point.

I lwork far away from my home and only get to spend a week at a time there. Normally it‚Äôs never been an issue with me. But lately I‚Äôve been working 90-40 days straight without going home.

"How is it that when the medication wears of and the depression is back in the first thing I feel is being discussed by everyone who is around. Be it friend of foe all I feel is being repulsed by them - actions, words and even looks. What fallows is a need for dissimilation,  destruction and suffering. Not mine... Not yet. But I find myself feeling some twisted joy in suffering of friends, strangers and others. Not causing it, but knowing they are suffering. Than comes the destruction with little words, with little gestures to bring them down - people around me. I find myself fantasising about methodically deconstructing and destroying my life. Hurting the ones I love, the ones who hope, the ones who love me. Destroying my home, carrier and finally when there is noone to grif when I'm gone myself. The only sanity left is fear - fear of those feelings and thoughts, and that one day, another time when I'm again coming off yet another medication that failed me the fear will be gone... Writing this hear is a failsafe. Hope that helps someone or at least me in the future. ",0

Feel alone in my situation 18 male and I‚Äôve had worst depression for like little bit over a year now. Right before that I was best I felt in my entire life. I felt like i was almost on top of the world. After years of being insecure of my appearance in middle school and freshman and sophomore year I started working out and eating healthy and felt and looked best I‚Äôve ever had. Sometimes I couldn‚Äôt stop looking at myself in mirror cause I was so obsessed with how good i looked which is a feeling I want back so badly. My dream at time was to be a model and a movie actor and those dreams seemed like it was gonna be a reality and I was living life to fullest and then I got chemical burn on my eyelids and it‚Äôs ruined my appearance ever since. I just completely lost myself and stopped caring about myself. I didn‚Äôt get proper treatment on my eyes until a year later of the incident and I‚Äôm on month three of my treatment and it feels like it‚Äôs taking forever for that normal feeling to come again. It makes me lack so much confidence in approaching ppl especially with women. And to make things worse was I found an awesome therapist who I adored but I wasn‚Äôt able to talk with her after php which was horrible. I feel like unless my eyes are healed I‚Äôm not good enough for a women to be with me. I‚Äôve done some bad things to cope with my depression and it still makes me end up lonely but worse. I‚Äôm hoping my eyes heal up fully so I get my life back on track but I have fear that my life will be like this for rest of my life.  ,0

Even after a got a job, we never spent much time together because I'm an ER nurse, so TV raised her. She watched all those teen mom shows, which inspired her to get pregnant at 15. I'm so mad at her, and mad at myself for not being there to make her make the right choices. But on the same note, I never wanted her to begin with, but I couldn't think about her being in foster care either. I don't love her, she's just like a roommate. I also hate my job, I wanted to be a writer, but after I had my daughter, there was no time. I still have social anxiety, making my life hell. I just want to disapear into the woods and never come out. I can't handle this, it's to much. I need someone to talk to who won't judge me.",0

"I get bullied so bad to the point bad things has been spread on my name for years now some of which are lies, my own family treats me terrible my as well, I went on a date with a guy who was intimate with me I was young so I became like really wanting to be with this person, but I didn‚Äôt know on his end he may have been talking bad like I‚Äôm a crazy girl who only wants intimacy or whatever, and ppl who already hated me are hating me more plus family and everyone who has heard, so I‚Äôm 25 now I get harassed everyday at work my phone is hacked so ppl can tell me everything on here and I‚Äôm cyber bullied so I literally have ppl on the other side of the country bullying me and in different countries, I have no body who doesn‚Äôt hate me in my life and then some of lies out there is ppl say I was a gold digger that‚Äôs why I was treated like that when I just graduated college and was young and on my own idk ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but that‚Äôs what I heard , or that I‚Äôm just easy or whatever he and I did go fast but he was the only person that happened with so it just is crazy to me how after that one time that‚Äôs just me , so now when I try to date or whatever they make it seems like I am only there for what they have and that I‚Äôm easy and like I said because this also cyber bullying so much ppl think of me that way all over I wouldn‚Äôt know where to go and because ppl didn‚Äôt have more than this to get mad at it grew the hate that everyone have on me they will say it‚Äôs different reasons I‚Äôm getting this treatment now when it stemmed from this date situation, I digress . But as I was saying now dating I don‚Äôt even have the courtesy of a normal conversation I‚Äôm treated like I‚Äôm stupid and like I‚Äôm indifferent, and also when I go through tough situations I tend to get in a place I‚Äôm alone and say my thoughts out loud because it gets it off my chest and not every time I want to speak to someone about this it has always been a secret place for me that I would never give out because I know I humiliation but it is my way of coping but what happened is during this because I guess ppl wanted to see what‚Äôs up with me and be nosey they found out I do this and because it‚Äôs a habit when I am going through a lot I end in a quiet place and let my thoughts out I can‚Äôt stop right away especially now you have so much against me like family everybody around and cyber bullying too I triggers this even more I guess and I can look to be overwhelmed, and that gets thrown in my face subtly when dating, then ppl just want to take advantage of me because of the situation with the guy absolutely no one heard me out it‚Äôs like automatically it was my fault and I was just a easy gold digger , and ppl keep trying to treat me like that even though I keep pushing that idea away I‚Äôve ended up in two relationships since this happened that didn‚Äôt last but I would always let them know they never have to do things for me for me to stay then I would accept them doing it then they would be like acting like so the rumours are true anything to make a point I feel since this date with this guy and since this situation I have lost my job and not able to work functionally because like I said ppl are bullying me there to so yes there were times that I was in need and the ppl I loved made me feel like they didn‚Äôt have a problem which I would always try to make it up when I can in the best way I can , but that only came around when ppl was trying to prove a point that this is who I am and when the harassment took a toll on me not before when I first dated the guy so I truly don‚Äôt understand why, but everyone hates me. It‚Äôs like ppl know this isn‚Äôt my character but is wanting to set everything up for me to be pushed down that road for especially family I feel you would‚Äôve wanted to pluck me out this mess and tell me the full truth on how it even got to them cuz I‚Äôm in a different country , and if they truly had my back like they said they wouldn‚Äôt let these ppl be my end all be all we would get back on even if it was with simply motivation and honesty but they don‚Äôt give me that. So because everyone hates me and the only way I feel I can be loved is by sexual abuse because again ppl think I‚Äôm easy and they just think that I‚Äôm this terrible person, maybe I should be what they want me to be , prostitute or whatever because  that‚Äôs the only love I will feel even if it‚Äôs not real, since this situation I‚Äôve gotten some bad sexual experiences so really if I don‚Äôt change my mindset in the moment it can feel like I‚Äôm being attacked, so idk how much I would like it but it I‚Äôm always drunk or high or something I can start feel like it‚Äôs the best thing ever and I will feel like I‚Äôm not fully hated from the world hating me , you don‚Äôt even have to do anything for me I will freely be yours , this isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve done already at least not by my choice I don‚Äôt know the lies , but I will try since that‚Äôs the category I keep getting put in or I die. Because if I never get down to the bottom of exactly why my privacy was taken like this and who did it specifically and that‚Äôs the thing because it‚Äôs so many ppl everyone is covering ppl I can only assume it‚Äôs some of these situations, but if I get to the bottom of it will be the only time I find peace on my own otherwise going through this now makes me feel like dying and so hated you feel you need to find someone so you end up in the loop of being used, maybe I should sell myself for 10 minutes of love I desperately can‚Äôt give myself because of this bullying I‚Äôm so depressed or just die.",0

"I had reached a point where I was suicidal. Was in suicidal depression for months. The only thing that keeps me is my animals. In the end I couldn't commit. So I've slowly started putting my life back together. It's not a life I want to live though.It feels like the more everything changes, it really just stays the same. I feel invisible to other people. I don't seem to matter to anyone. Both a relieving and isolating feeling. I met someone I really hit it off with. It's been years since I felt that. We both expressed that we really liked each other. Yet they don't respond when I reach out. This has been a common experience over the past few years. I thought this time would be different since we seemed to have a real connection. I was wrong. So I'm just existing in this weird space. Nobody wanting anything to do with me. Me mostly not wanting anything to do with anyone else. Working just to have food and some entertainment. To be alone day after day. To just pass the time without much interest. I feel like a camera you don't notice is there. I observe the world around me, these days not passing much judgement on what I witness. It all feels inconsequential. I feel inconsequential.Now I'm in the space of knowing I'd rather not continue, yet I can't not continue. I come into contact with a lot of different people, from different walks of life. Occasionally I feel something but it's so dull. I long to feel envy, or pity, or connection. I have taken my shots at living the life I wanted and they all failed. It's left me feeling broken, disappointed, and changed. Or feeling like my light has been misplaced. I don't think I have it in me to try, seriously, at making a life. I guess I'm just running out the clock.",0

"I believe only reason to live is experience new things you didn't experience before and see the forwards. I don't want to do repeating activities.When I was younger I was fillling myself with vast amount of knowledge found on Internet. Educating myself further I have collected knowledge in programming, graphics design and chemistry. Learning about something new everyday is what made me what I'm.  My personality is revolved around things that interest me, I do not have any friends who are interested in common things I do, lack of large friend group and being socially awkward doesn't make things any better but I grew up to tolerate it better. I'm diagnosed with Autism under label of PDD-NOS in age of 6 and I got rediagnosed at age 16.  I absorb knowledge easily, produce solutions and give answers to people or simply whoever is interested in my ideas. I like dumping large amounts of knowledge to whoever I meet.Yeah sure there are still large amount of things to learn, and it's impossible to collect all of them, but I can know enough to do many things and so anyone else can with spare time that everyone lacks after their childhood. I'm basically forced this way due to not being able to socialize properly, I want to build whatever I'm imagining myself, alone. This is pretty irrational since it is not possible to a single person to finish things in short amount of time, but this is what I'm. I will never able to have coworkers, or be a boss. Limting factor is how humans are made to work. Everything has a hierarchy it never changed since ancient times. Humans with greater power control ones with less power and those control even ones with less power but at the absolute bottom these ones are so weak they cannot be controlled and there are people so strong they cannot be controlled.Almost everything in past has a noticeable pattern. We cannot prove everything has a direct cause since how we exist is even a question at it's own that cannot be explained in a logical way. So many just prefer having a religion or simply don't mind personally I'm agnostic, there's no way to disprove or prove a creator so it's undefined. But in our current time frame almost everything has a input and output aka cause and result,  cause and result relationship cannot be well estabilished in many scenarios so this caused inaccuracy in reasoning, but for cases it can it allows a way to understand how everything ""resonates"" in a good balance. There's a pattern in way things work. Understanding relationships between different phenomena allows one of most powerful ways to learn new information, reason and produce new information.This gets to the point of you notice everything has so many common things you feel like you are just way too much full of information and cannot produce valid results for people who expect it. You notice how humans are still ""pre-programmed""  like other animals do but at a lesser extent.You notice that many things interested you were in your childhood, when you had strongest ability to connect the dots and understand patterns which this ability diminishes as you age.  I'm hungry for knowledge, I seek more knowledge and at end I'm still unhappy. Most of things we learn could been logically deducted from limited amount of knowledge you have. You notice that you can predict how something will end up before you read detailed information about a topic and you see you were generally right from start.This is what happened to me, what is the point of living even? I'm aware existental crisis can happen to anyone else but this is going for almost half a year. I enjoy nothing new,I live in Turkey where people even would have harder time to be great at what they are and instead forced into unknown situations in the moment they turn 18. When I was young I acted quite weird I would dream about things and flap my hands involuntarily when doing that, I was beaten up in school by teacher, I was subjected to multiple intelligence tests in my childhood as another result of my weirdness and somehow I did well in these tests those were only tests that I did score somewhat good, my mother always tell me ""you are smart whatever you are doing is weird I'm starting to doubt your intelligence"". I recently become obsessed with taking online IQ tests, I took so many of them and yet I got similar scores as I did in my childhood score which was 115, online scores were between range of 100 to 120. Still I believe I'm dumbest person around with small set of friends I have. Reminder that average IQ for Turkey is 87, considering that being almost 2 standard deviations above the average of the country is huge. This score isn't even in gifted range or something would give a person very superior abilities to the point they would be cogntiveily successful in almost anything mentally demanding. It's simply high average to bright intelligence for western countries. Nothing more nothing less at best I'm an awful software engineer with that. I struggle with even simple maths that even a person with lower intelligence can do maths at better speed than I can, I may able to understand it more detailed but they will still do it faster than me because I'm very very slow in daily life except for learning things.  I always mistake left and right, fail to follow directions correctly and have trouble understanding whatever they are trying to tell. I don't have an exact personality, It varies a lot, my limited set of friends say that my opinions suddenly changed, my opinions change so suddenly about a topic 10 minutes ago I would be saying  something else and now I would say something else, my brain is simply broken and not knowing about what could be cause of it is horrible, I'm not even sure if diagnoses I received to date are entirely correct.I feel like I'm losing a lot of my abilities, I had ability to learn something extremely fast and catch details but my  ability in this area seems to be decline back then when it takes to learn from one small wikipedia article with roughly 2000 words took one read now it takes two or three reads to remember the concept perfectly for long time.  I had strong tonal memory which I would able to memorize music and play it in head, it's kind like what people call as ""earworms"" but I was able to control mine and play whatever I wanted. I was able to keep a piece of music for 10+ years without forgeting it but now memorizing a piece of song is huge struggle for me. It barely even lasts a day, sometimes I forget within 10 minutes. I want my ability of remembering any song I hear back so much. It at least made my life more fun while it lasted.Overally I'm a person that many won't find interesting at all, I see no value in myself too. My currently only reason to exist is to see how well it'll turn out, if I manage to experience more good memories then I'll live if not then I'll end it up before turning 30 possibly by taking a shot to head.At least before I die I want to leave world my mark it might be small and irrelevant as hundreds of thousands already do it every year, people publish papers Elsevier and Springer profit from their papers and they receive almost nothing from it. Millions of papers reference each other and build a huge network of research to be exploited by major corporations (this includes news sites milking stuff out of research and turn it into clickbait)  World is such a shitty place that people are manipulated with money, money is the single most important discovery as in sense of human psychology, making unwilling participants to work together. Collaborate something that other animals mostly lack. Money was and is required to build the world we know of. Wish people can see the entire point is discovering things.",0
"Hello, I am 23y female and recently tried to go to a therapist since my thoughts were keeping me awake at night, thought about death and how it feels to die, how it would be like (I know that I won't do it, because of my family and few people around me ... but if I had nobody, then I do not see a purpose of being here ...), or the self harm, low self esteem, sleep struggle too much or so little, feeling worthless and useless, and lost, empty.... So I tried to book appointment,  but sadly they were fully booked, but then suddenly one took me in for at least consultation and told me that I've seeked out help at the right time, which made me feel relieved a little, but then the guilt started to creep out.     So I continued to get the help and got it after few weeks, yesterday actually. They admitted me to their hospital not like hospitalisation, but made me a card as their new patient (sorry english is not my first language), assigned me a psychotherapist and psychiatrist after the diagnostic examination with them with the diagnose of severe depressions.     But .... here is the but. What if I am not? What if I am just thinking that I do have something while in reality there is nothing? ... Every time I feel ... the way I feel, I am thinking about other people, that in the end I should be damn happy, since I got my dad, a roof above my head, bed, water, people at work, food ... things I wanted ... and then the guilt takes over that I should be grateful for what I have... and then I force myself to be normal once again, which lasts for few days sometimes a week or two  but then it goes back, and repeat. it is never ending circle. What if I am just using it as an excuse, what if it is just some weird need inside of me to have something and I have been faking it? I feel lost and confused. ",0
"I don‚Äôt know where to rant except here, so bear with me guys. Basically right now I‚Äôm feeling more hateful than I‚Äôve ever been before, and I really wish I didn‚Äôt but that‚Äôs what happens when people put petty internet politics ahead of moral reasoning.Anyway, it ALWAYS seems like, whenever something good to me happens, something bad immediately happens afterwards. For example, two years ago my crush at the time - and good friend - gave me a gift for Christmas and it was the second time I was over the moon in the span of a month. That entire year was something else tbh, since she turned out to be not so good anyway, but at the time she seemed so nice that she had no flaws at all. Typical stupid hormones clouding judgement.Also, I got the best news in my life yesterday regarding a chronic illness I‚Äôve had all my life - and since I‚Äôm a medical student, I asked on a related subreddit blanket statements on technique, effectiveness, etc, and was removed for being ‚Äúmedical advice‚Äù even though it was solely because I was curious about the surgery itself. I know, it probably doesn‚Äôt sound super important but this is a reoccurring theme in my life. Little things fuck up my happiness. Ugh. ",0

"F, 24 baliw na (ata).  Di ko alam kung dala ba to ng mga trauma na naexperience ko before kaya nagkaka ganito na ako. I've been cheated multiple times before na pag ba nalaman nyo yung buong kwento e para lang syang pelikula na ginago ng writer.Araw araw kung ano ano yung naiisip ko kapag mag isa ako. Dati ko na ring tinangkang magpakamatay at sige ang laslas ko kapag wala sa lugar yung mga naiisip ko. I always felt lonely, always felt that I wasn't enough,  always felt that I will never be enough. Kung titingnan yung buhay ko without knowing all my thoughts, sobrang regular lang nya. Pero putangina, may mga oras talaga na hindi ko kayang pigilin yung sarili ko na para bang punong puno na ako at gusto na sumabog nalang. I actually have a partner, nearly a year na. He's very kengkoy or kung iisipin sya yung joker ng grupo o barkadahan, ako naman sakto lang. Masaya lang kami haha, since the beginning wala pa talaga kaming nagiging pagtatalo. Kung meron man yung mga minor lang like 2 mins okay na kami agad. Pero kahit anong saya ko sa kanya o kahit anong saya namin sa isat isa, nababaliw na talaga ako. Meron paring sad spot na natitira sa buhay ko, sa puso ko. Nakakalungkot lang kase di rin ako makapag share ng nararamdaman ko sa kanya kase feeling ko di sya interesado. Minsan din kase nangyari na pinangaralan nya ako o pinagsabihan lang nung nag express ako sa kanya ng thoughts ko. I do felt na nainvalidate talaga yung feelings ko kaya siguro nawalqn na rin ako ng lakas ng loob na magsabi sa kanya. Ngayon naiisip ko nalang na pagod na pagod na ko sa buhay ko. Na para saan rin ba to e wala naman akong maabot abot. Halo halo na sila e. I actually want to tell more kaso pagod na ako. I'm barely holding on and feels like malapit ko nang putulin yung thread na kinakapitan ko. I'm so fvcking sick and tired of my life. ",0
"I really need some sort of help distinguishing between if I actually need medication or just therapy. Or any advice...anything.How can you draw the line between feelings caused by yourself or by an actual issue in your brain? I feel like my issues are caused by myself, as in I perpetuate this horrible feelings. Maybe I sit around too much, maybe I don't do enough. I don't know anymore.The events and thoughts that trigger these hour+ episodes feel situational, but I've tried to shake them away to no avail. When I think about how I'm lonely, misunderstood, outcasted etc., it sends me spiraling (stuff like that). I've tried making friends and putting myself out there to maybe make some connections, but it's only been making me feel worse. Basically, it's been getting increasingly harder to cope with these growing feelings of anxietyand depression.Soon, I'll be going back up to school and need to make a decision before it's too late, and nobody obviously knows who the hell I am. Medicine seems to be overprescribed and seen as the quick fix. The other issue: I don't have time for therapy. It's been *hell* trying to get appointments in, so I'm left to wonder what I can even do at this point.If someone has gone through this, please give me some sort of pointers. I feel like I'm blaming myself too much, or maybe that I'm giving myself too much benefit of the doubt, that these emotions are not my fault.",0
"I 28f was extremely suicidal as a teen. I never did it obviously and always used how my mom would react along with the possibility of a future as my reason. This is literally my first time on reddit because I need to get this out. Even though I was using my possible future as my reason I honestly never planned or expected to make it this far. I've been living my life just coping with the fact that I'm alive but now I honestly don't know what to do. I've been in therapy for years and I still don't want to die, I just struggle with the fact that I'm alive sometimes. It's like my future is here but I'm at the same place I was as a teen. Honestly I don't know where to go from here. I keep moving forward with school and therapy because that's what your supposed to do. I disassociate all the time and constantly switch between feeling nothing and everything all at once which triggers the nothing.

"Well my fellow broken friends, we know our depression warps our view of the world and ourselves so my main support my mom would remind me of the things I know to be true.

"Hi reddit, I'm 17 F and my depression and anxiety has spiked, it's becoming really hard to just go about normal life. It's summer break rn and no one is ever home anymore and when they are it's them talking amongst themselves about stuff I don't understand or they don't want me to hear. I know I have no reason to have these issues, and I'm just being childish for it but at this rate I don't know how I'm going to keep going. My mom has stopped talking to me unless it's to tell me to do something or that I did something wrong. She took my little brother 13 m and his friend fishing 2 days ago (my little brother ""lives"" at my step grandmas), and yesterday she spent it with my older brother 18 m and today she's with my older brother again. My stepdad is never home because of the work he does. I just sit in the house with the dog and cats. I only got my dog because after my 2 brothers both got a cat and dog, I freaked out because ""it wasn't fair"" and we got the keep the last puppy for me but they all hate him because he's dumb and was the rut so he isn't all there (the 10th puppy) in the end I keep having to see him get yelled at and hatted because I couldn't just be greatful that my brothers got all that. I don't what to do I just want to feel normal and not be an outcast in my own family. But I think other family members are starting to notice because they keep trying to invite me to stuff but my mom never makes it a priority so I never get to go. (I can't drive). Maybe I'm the problem because I can't do anything right and keep just failing at making Mom feel like I'm someone who deserves her love and I know I don't always treat her right but I don't know what to do. I get mad that the only time she talks to me is to tell me to do something but I don't know how to tell her that. I'm sorry to anyone who read through this I just need somewhere to rant ",0

"Basically Im writing this so I can get an opinion about how I've feeling since childhood. I never had the money to go to a therapist of any kind but I just want to get this over with and start by identifying what it is.I come from an extremely abusive family with a narc father that prayed upon my mother when she was a teenager and thats how I basically came about. During my childhood I have witnessed many fights, physical and verbal that have left me with terrible overthinking and anxiety to the point of not being able to speak in school or any other places. Ever since I was little I have known that there was something very wrong happening within my family and life but I didnt manage to see the extent untill I became a teen. Besides this, as a lesbian, I grew up being a more masculine girl and I really liked wearing boys clothes, cutting my hair short and stuff like that, all of which my father berrated me for. Calling me insane, ugly and stupid, while I was between the ages of 7 to 13.When I was 16 my mother thankfully left my father and took me with her, we had to get a restraining order, but he still messaged us and followed us on the street. During this time my mother got with one of her coworkers that she had known for some time. At the start it was ok, but he and my mother got into very intense fights from time to time which only reminded me of our previous life. I also want to mention that ever since I can remember I just can not find it me to trust or befriend men, let alone live peacefully in the same house with one.Eventually my mom, stepdad and I moved toghether in an apartment and from then on their fights only got worse. Stuff about cheating, who does what chores and whatnot. After some time this guy started complaining to my mom about every single piece of dust in the house that bothered him, including me leaving my coat on the hanger beside the door when I got home and other insignificant crap like that. There was one particularly bad fight that led him to brake like half of the plates in the house and another time where they were yelling so loud that the police car patroling the area heard them from the street and came up to ask what was happening to them. I had to live like this with them for about a year of constant fighting and breaking things, before I got so fed up by them that I flat out told that asshole if he broke one more thing of my mothers I would drag him out and leave him out for the whole night. Apparently he got extremely ""depressed"" by what I told him and my mother said he feels like this is not his home anymore. Like I would give a shit after all the stuff I had to hear from him for a whole year.My mother said that she would find me a place to stay and that she would cover the rent as long as I cover the bills with what I get from my part time job while I also go to uni. I agreed, Ive been wanting to live on my own for quite some time, unfortunately living with other people never went that well for me. Ive never known a house of peace and quiet untill I finally moved by myself.I explained all of this to give some context of why I am felling so unmotivated and down all of the time, all of this plus the bullying from middleschool, my terrible highschool experience in the pandemic coupled with my parents messed up break up, threats from my father, constant fighting all around, lack of meaningfull friendships and experiences, all of these have led me to where I am now. Even tho things are better I still cant shake this feeling of mental tiredness and lack of motivation to grow in any way. My only meaningfull relationship now is with my long distance girlfriend who I dont get to see as often as we would like, and my mother.I have the feeling that all of these things that happened to me and my mom have soured our relationship and its not as good as it once was, but everytime I try to talk to her about this she either says its my fault or tells me that Im imagining things.I have considered suicide from as early as 11 years old, pretty much only imagining how and when I would do it, but never actually made a solid plan to follow. Its been like am anchor for me, anytime things got really bad I would think about it and it almost brought me comfort sometimes. By the time mom broke up with my father I have stopped wanting to do it eventually, but the feeling remains. I dont have the energy to do things I wish I could, I dont have the energy to socialise, the school Im going to doesnt interest me at all, my part time job that I got is ok I guess but thats pretty much all that I feel like Im able do to. The rest of my time is spent playing videogames, drawing sometimes, cleaning my studio and thats about it. I remember being 10 years old and staring up at the ceiling, thinking about all the mean things kids at school would tell me sometimes, then telling myself that one day all will be better and I would feel good. Almost 10 years later now and I still cant shake that same feeling from all that time ago, and I dont know what to do anymore. If anybody has advice I would be thankfull to hear it, or if you have a better subreddit I should post this to please let me know.Thank you for everybody that read everything ",0

We parted ways after this so we were apart for many years and we don't talk that much anymore. I don't like my family either. I wish I had a different family. My mum is so mean and she's always been.

"SA warning17m, diagnosed with social anxiety also feeling very depressed these days, it's affecting my studies and basically everything I used to enjoy once has now been a thing in the past.I come from a very toxic family and been abused from as long as I can remember it's still on,back than due to a light infection which my parents neglected and judged me for it which later on grew and affected me really badly and pulled me down everyway I have been inside my home from than although I have recovered from it but that trauma still lives on with me,we later changed cities and cuz of how anti social I became I was extremely bullied in my school which led to the droppage of my grades which in turn led to more family abuse,I also wanna study and get better grades but just doing it hurts since my family loves to leave remarks and judge me for anything regardless of what I do,so fast forward I have been in extreme depression for 6 years now,In my final year of hs no friends,I also don't have any money to afford anything so therapy is out of the question, all my old friends are gone and I just feel so lonely,and basically I'm still stuck in the past.No matter how hard I try I think I'll forever be lonely now,even my last of friends ended it on a bad note saying that I was extemped as a bully shuttle for some time just because my dad died recently and that I am pathetic.I have trust issues too since I have been scammed by my ex friends  a few times and also SA at school.I feel like everyone I meet is a jerk or it's just that I don't deserve to fit in anywhere like everyone says to me",0

"Perhaps because I've been hated so much, I can easily sense when someone's actions towards me are off. I think a part of me has become more sensitive after going through so much. But another part of me believes it‚Äôs right.People often say not to stay close to those who are hated, as you might understand why they are despised. Looking around, I see many people who hate me. So, I don't bother building new relationships; I become quieter and more withdrawn.Because I'm hated, after every meeting, after every conversation, I spend months analyzing if I said something wrong or behaved poorly. I know that sometimes, people hate me because, at times, I'm also the bad guy.Since I'm hated, I just hope that if everyone hates me, they will just say it and leave. Don't linger in my life, making me disappointed, comparing me, treating me badly. If they hate me, they should just leave. Don't stay and hurt me until I have to be the one to leave first. Don't torment me to make my life even more miserable.Today, I read this quote from someone‚Äôs post: ""I have enough sadness already."" I realized, I also have enough sadness. I don't need anyone to hurt me more because I have enough sadness to last a lifetime. I have many wounds from ten years ago still waiting to heal. So, if you hate me, leave me, IMMEDIATELY.

"I've been working as a content writer for the last decade and freelancing since 2020. I loved my job.

"I hate how much i hate my mom but she's a fucking narcissistic lunatic bitch. The silent treatment she gives me is driving me insane, I'm constantly harming myself for her attention. My dads a fucking porn addicted loser, he did nothing his own life, sat at home with the comfort of what my mother provided to the family. Neither can he defend me when the abuse takes place nor does he give a shit about me. He can't even strike a conversation with me, he only talks about himself. He's so immature, so childish, it's disgusting. My mom's very hardworking, she did everything she could to raise me, she even rented her jewels just to pay for my school. But the abuse is too much. I've been strangled, constant beatings, slaps punches, cutting me what not. This isn't it even it, the abuse was mostly emotional. After I talk to her, I'm constantly left doubting if my reality is real, it's like i remember everything wrong. She denies anything she has ever said to me. It's so crazy, I can't figure out whether she wants me to live or not. Whenever I try to end it, she comes crying, begging me to live, and if I die my dad will probably end it too. But sometimes she randomly tells me to end it, and that my family would be better off, thriving, without me. It's been 3 years since I've been depressed. The only reason why I've been trying to live is because I don't want my parents to be sad. I did try many times, I also od'ed, she acted kindly for a few days but hell broke lose after that. The abuse is so much. It's torture. I feel like I'm in hell. I can't bear hearing anymore of her bullshit. It genuinely hurts so much. The times when I had no hopes to live is returning. I don't care about the pain anymore. Living is more painful than anything. I don't want to be an annoyance to my mother anymore, I'm sick of being a burden. But I want to hear her cry and scream after she finds me hanging. I want my revenge. I want her to feel bad about me being dead. I want her to blame herself for everything she did to me. But at the same time I don't want this to happen to her. It's not her fault, it's my fault for being the worst daughter ever alive. But again if I die, she'll again probably forget in a month or so.

"I am a 18 years old girl. Will be 19 in next month. So here's my story -My father never cared about me and my mother so we live in my grandpa's house. 2 years ago my mother left me because of some other men. She emotionally manipulated me to accept the relationship. I can't , it's not because I don't want her to marry anyone. It's because he is a bad guy and she is still married with my father. She blamed everyone (my uncle , my grandma and grandpa) for wasting her life. But there's no fault of them. They told her to divorce my father when I was merely 1 or 2 years old. But she didn't because of me.On the other hand , the family I am living with they always forbid me to talk to everyone , go anywhere since my childhood. I didn't even allowed to go 1km away from my house to buy something when I was 14-15. Because of that social anxiety grew in me. And now suddenly they are pushing me to went out and talk to everyone. But why they don't understand that because of them only I am scared of people. But now they keep denying it. When I used to talk to people and go out with my friends with just 500 meters away from my house , my mother used to beat me so much. And I went there with my family's permission , but then also she did that. And not even once , she did it severe times.I used to have friends but they all left me and some friendship broke because I changed my school. In my new school , all girls were mean to me. When they needed something they all pampering me like I was their best friend but when their work was done they were like I didn't even exist. I changed that school also for some reasons ( I took science stream because I loved that but for the things my mother did with me I was in trauma so I couldn't go forward with the stream so I changed my stream and took admission in another school) , now I am studying in an open school.I wanted to become a film director , but my uncle and other relatives forbid me to do that. It's ok I understand their concern. Because that industry is not easy for any middle class people. But it was my childhood dream. Now I figured out that apart from that I love psychology also and I can become a psychologist. It took me 2 years to figure it out and few weeks ago I told it to my uncle. I thought he would be proud that I want to do that but he deny that also. He said I am taking decisions emotionally and I can't make money from that career and I should choose another one. Now I don't know what to do , every career I chose they rejected. I have no hope left now.I made some online friends also during lockdown. They also left me. Few months ago also I made some friends but when I saw they gave all of our time to others I started distancing myself from them also because I can clearly say by their behavior that I was only for timepass. So I broke those friendships because I am afraid to feel that pain again , the pain when someone's heart broke. I am tired of it. But I trusted my one friend , I had many thoughts that how I will wish her on Friendship Day , but look at my fate , before friendship day comes she also left me.Now I become a person who forgot how real smile feels like. You can say I smile all the time but not the real one. Now from past few days I can't even smile , I feel like staying alone all the time. I forgot how best friends feels like. I have exams 1 month later but I can't study a single word. Whenever I started studying my brain feels tired , I don't know what to do. I feel hopeless. I feel like I am not worthy to anything , I feel like I should be punished everytime. I used to love painting , singing , studying. These were my life but I stop loving these also. I don't found peace in anything like these which I used to do all the time.Everytime I tried to talk with my uncle (he is raising me now because my mother left the house) about my anxiety and depression , he made me feel like that I am mistaking it as depression it's not that and I am a kid I don't know about it. Now I feel like I am the one who destroyed the family. If I didn't took birth everyone would be happy. My mother didn't marry that time because of me , she could marry if I hadn't been born. My uncle didn't marry anyone because of me , if I hadn't been born then he would have been happy with his wife and children. And my grandpa and grandma doesn't deserve a granddaughter like me. If my uncle and mother got married with their partners , they would have their children who would have been best. Not a girl like me.My all friends doing best in their lives and here I am. 3 years of my life already wasted for the trauma. And now this point I am consumed by the darkness more from which I was trying to come out from 3 years. And this time it's too much , I am tired of everything and I don't even have anyone to talk with about these.",0

"So I‚Äôve hit my boyfriend a good three times, but he tells people I hit him when I actually didn‚Äôt and I can‚Äôt say anything because I did before.1st time I did it, he was mad at me and told me he was going to give our daughter a shower. Ok fine whatever, even though I‚Äôm usually the only one that gives her a shower.She starts crying and I come in asking what‚Äôs wrong but instead, he pushes the door on me, trying to keep me out. I pushed back hard, I think he wasn‚Äôt expecting it, and I tried grabbing her but he started pushing me out the door so I started punching him and once he finally let go of her (she wasn‚Äôt anywhere near my punches he was completely blocking her from me) I grabbed her and investigated‚Ä¶He got soap in her eye and wasn‚Äôt washing it off, probably thought she was being a sucky baby‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt know what was going on he doesn‚Äôt communicate with me properly.2nd time, he broke my cousins tv, punched a whole in my wall, and called my grandpa stupid when he told my bf he has bad anger problems, I was already reaching my breaking point with him especially since I was pregnant that time and had a one year old, he stole my wifi box during an argument because I wouldn‚Äôt let him drink, which he has a problem with.So I put my baby in her crib and chased him and fought him because without it, I can‚Äôt phone/talk to my family, my only support.3rd time, he stole from me again and called me a dumb bitch because I got mad at him and told him to go, I called him a bitch back and he went rushing to my room (he had everything of his) so my thought was he wanted to steal, I chased him again and he started pushing my arm away which hurt a lot because I‚Äôve broken them before and instead of being submissive, I got angry and fought him for hurting me.I have anger problems, I came from an abusive mother, to abusive foster home, to abusive relationship so I thought he‚Äôd be more understanding with how I deal with threats.The thing is, he tells people I hit him and the kids, and it‚Äôs randomly, unprovoked, and says I‚Äôm abusive and mean out loud like he wants everyone to hear.He phones people mid argument (no physical alterations) and sobs while telling them I beat him up, and if they say leave or ask if he‚Äôs on drugs, he gets mad at them and tries to be good with me.He doesn‚Äôt work (mental health problems) and leaves me home all day and does the bare minimum when he comes home and even makes a mess when I just finished cleaning, I‚Äôm exhausted and distraught that I‚Äôm in a relationship where I feel so threatened all the time and I‚Äôm abusive, I don‚Äôt like hitting him, I know it‚Äôs wrong, and even sometimes I wish he‚Äôd hit me back‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm depressed and hate that he‚Äôs my partner and hate the way I am.

Hello I'm a college student from Bangalore. I'm currently in 6th semester engineering. From 2nd semester to till now I've never took a single rupee from my parents for my living and expenses. I was working and earning through part time and some other small businesses. 5 months back I've fell into a casino trap and lost all my money. Even now I didn't ask my parents for financial aid to living in this city( I come from a small town). I stopped playing that sin casino that day. But now it has come on my neck. Till now I have survived. But I can't manage it anymore. The money I lent 5 months back has to be paid. My parents doesn't know that I fell into casino trap and i can't tell them about this as they would breakdown. My placements are nearing and exams as well. I've lost in the game of life and wouldn't be able to make my parents happy and proud. I'm lost. Should I live?I wish God give me one chance to come out of this mess and concentrate on my career and family. ,0

"im not sure how to explain this but ill do my best. i feel like i dont want to get better. i thought i wanted to get better but the small part of my brain that wants to get better is practically gone. i want to get as bad as possible. as sick as possible. i want everyone to realize, but when people actually ask about it or notice i panic and use my usual excuse. (i say that im just tired, which jm technically not lying because i am tired of life.) ",0
"I hate how nowdays there are many of us who feel this way. Reading many posts here I realised that there are too many of us who are just tired of our jobs, lack of friendships, goals,motivation.I (23m) am tired of working dead end job and making someone else rich, having not so best circumstances as some other people my age.I lack friendships,I lack human connection. I have no girlfriend. I have hobbies but they are surely going to Boring town.I know I want to live and Im grateful for having chance but Im worried for future. ",0
"I went to see my primary doctor today after she referred me to a therapist, and I have been seeing the therapist. But I went today because my headache, leg ache, and neck ache are all too much. I told her everything, and she said, unfortunately, everything I am experiencing is tied back to my mental health, and the only way I can get better is if my mental health improves. When she said that, I wanted to cry because I know my mental health will never get better so I have to live with these extreme body fatigue. I have been dealing with depression since I was 11, and I am almost 23 now, and over the years, it has only gotten worse. I have tried so many times to get better, but the traumatic events that keep happening to me are unbearable. I can't believe I have to live like this; my heart breaks for me. I told my mom, ""See, you told me to see the doctor, but every doctor keeps saying the same thing.‚Äô‚Äô I don‚Äôt even know who I am suppose to blame for my suffering. It hurts because people expect me to do regular human chores but I am physically not capable of doing anything I am literally mentally and physically sick. I can‚Äôt rest for even five minutes. ",0
"I think one of the worst parts of my self hatred is knowing I'm making things worse yet not stopping it out of distrust of my own mind. I stress eat and before even getting the food know it's stress eating bad food yet don't stop it. Sometimes I avoid the things that may improve my mood, or knowingly lie to people for shitty reasons. I need to take meds yet just sit or lay down while actively thinking about them. Self sabotage is about the only skill I have and at this rate even if I don't kill myself one day my horrible decisions will do it for me. I know all of this yet don't do anything but worsen it and thus worsen my self hatred. It'd have been so much simpler if an accident had happened way back before all this I swear.",0

"I tried all those pills and only non stimulant adhd meds have helped me slightly. I feel so empty without any substance. I was sober from 18-21 and it was the worst time of my life. I need weed or to drink a few times a week. It's the only love I have. Nobody besides the bar flies will talk to me and I have worn my presence on them. I'm truly a crap sack. I don't deserve pity, but maybe I can relate with others. Never hurt anybody however. Never made anybody cry either besides my parents and some crazy exs. I've just created a lot of animosity and drugs are my only friends that stick around. I'm not off the deep in yet. I keep myself in check, but it's not a good place to be either. If only a girl could save me like just is the answer. Sinning is all there is to this world. Sorry jesus",0
"I've been depressed for a long time. For the past 16 years, I had no friends, little interaction with family, worked very little, no relationships, no hobbies, no travel, no exercise/sports etc etc, the usual stuff. The main reason for all that is my inherent desire to escape suffering. Obviously since I'm depressed, I have zero motivation to do anything. And anytime I start doing things, my anxiety kicks in really bad. So in order to escape from the active suffering, I've lived like a hermit, on the very little money that I manage to save after doing some work. I barely do anything everyday, even stuff that I used to enjoy.But recently, I've decided I will actively start doing the things I hate that nevertheless allows me to pretend I'm human. I will take the advanced courses that I need for my career to progress. I will start exercising for 1-2 hours every single day. I will start forcing myself to interact more with people. I will try to make friends and start relationships. I will start engaging in hobbies and sports. I will put a lot of effort in getting a better job and actually keeping them.All of these are things that I hate beyond words. All of them give me intense fear and disgust. But I've essentially given up on finding a solution to my problems. I've accepted that my illness will never end. But I will emulate being human anyway, because the one duty I feel I have is to make my family and friends happy. They are all very sad at my condition, but I don't want them to suffer because of me. I'm also doing this out of spite towards my body and mind. I hate both of them, I curse them for what they've become. So I will make them suffer like they made me suffer.  And if the suffering becomes too much for me that I do the unthinkable, then so be it. But no more of this half-existence where I neither enjoy nor suffer. ",0

"You never think about depression being physically exhaustinv, i never thought it'dmake me physical tired constantly and leave me needing more sleep. Going from someone that was well rested on 4hrs a night to needing 6 or 7, with naps during the day. At this point im just deteriorating. ",0
"I hate having a body, I despise almost every one of its functions. I hate almost all physical sensations, even the pleasant ones are overshadowed by how limited I feel by having a body. I feel perpetually cramped by just existing. I hate eating, drinking, shitting, pissing, breathing, hearing my blood pump when it's quiet, hearing my heart beat. It's all so disgusting to me, how could anyone like any of this? I often feel very detached from my body due to how much I wish I wasn't trapped in one. There is almost no sensations that I enjoy so it is extremely easy for me to become tired with something physically as I just cannot bring myself to care enough. I eat less, drink less. My body doesn't even really tell me when I'm hungry anymore I am just hit with sudden waves of fatigue and think ""oh I must not have eaten or drank in a while. Now I have to."" I despise it. I feel like nothing in this world was meant for me. How do all of you feel about having a body? For those of you who enjoy having a body, what do you enjoy about it? ",0
"I feel I need a break from social media. A little backstory: I have PTSD (from sexual trauma). I would go on social media. I‚Äôm very psychically isolated, meaning I don‚Äôt go out much due to disability. So I spend most days in my room, which I struggle with depression. So I wouldn‚Äôt want to go out anywhere. And generally, I‚Äôm happy. I guess with that, sometimes it‚Äôs torture, but sometimes I choose voluntarily to do it. My friends are busy. They have jobs. And I start college soon. But yet I feel alone and isolated (by my own choices and my own doing because of multiple reasons). So I‚Äôd spend a lot of time on social media. And I hear stories and stuff that‚Äôs bad, but it‚Äôs my only form of engagement and ‚Äúcommunity.‚Äù I‚Äôve always been an  isolating person, to where I would choose to stay in my own bubble and then in-engage in person.  I was always like this, but my main problem is that I would see all these stories and I can‚Äôt delete the app because my friends would use them or I‚Äôd feel I‚Äôm missing out on something. I do have a therapist. I‚Äôm trying to work through this with them.",0
"I apologize if this is messy and stuff this is a throw away account because I just need a place to rant/vent.Im turning 18 soon and I don‚Äôt want to live anymore due to so much emotional abuse from my own parents, mainly my mother. She‚Äôs traditional which I understand however this doesn‚Äôt excuse her telling me that she‚Äôs going to take me somewhere so my brain is checked since there‚Äôs something wrong with me. I know I‚Äôm not perfect yet me being who I am shouldn‚Äôt be an excuse and not wanting to be like her. I‚Äôve heard this for years but it‚Äôs so hurting to hear her say these words to me. Recently my tia is supposed to arrive from another state around my birthday which I don‚Äôt mind but they‚Äôre forcing a party for not only her but also for me, and I hate parties even mini ones. My parents said it wasn‚Äôt a party for me however they told me to pick a cake for myself, and to accept any gifts even if I hated it. I understand we have to be respectful but I have different interests and I hate accepting gifts I hate because I know I will never use them. I started to cry alone in my room and my mother gets mad at since crying is only for children and not ‚Äúyoung ladies.‚Äù She leaves my room but later she comes back to my room and she lays down next to me as I‚Äôm trying to stop crying snd telling me that, my father is going to be much anger and yell at me for crying. I know this seems petty but I‚Äôve dealt with this emotional manipulation for years and this is just one out of many moments that made me feel like I was nothing to them but an accessory to a happy family and a doll for my mother to control. I‚Äôm so tired of this endless loop of us getting into arguments and my mother emotionally abusing me so I can‚Äôt say no because I know I‚Äôm crazy with my intrusive thoughts and just want this to stop because it gets us nowhere.

"I‚Äôve had a rough year, all due to my own actions in a single episode. Nearly a year ago I got drunk during a manic episode and cheated on a partner (someone who was amazing) and it shifted my life completely. I was the funny stoner nerd then and after that night I turned into a depressed loser. Weed really helped me but after that night I‚Äôll smoke and just have panic attacks about how wrong I was. I went sober for a bit but couldn‚Äôt stay with it due to not being able to deal with my emotions/not due able to smoke weed. I started smoking cigs b/c of it and tbh while I hate I smoke them I can‚Äôt stop. I‚Äòve fallen into a deep depression, deepest I‚Äôve ever felt. I lost multiple jobs, lost my passions and lost myself. I was in a bad living situation where I had a roommate who didn‚Äôt pay rent and owes me nearly 10K at this point. Because of this I was almost evicted but do well at my main job where I paid their back rent to keep my place til lease ended. I now live in a pretty crappy apartment with two friends and it‚Äôs made me so depressed b/c my place before was amazing. A few weeks ago due to how I felt I lost that same partner that was kind enough to forgive me for what I did. I know it‚Äôs my fault and that one night that lead to all these issues. Since then I‚Äôve turned heavily into alcohol. I think of killing myself nearly every day. The last few nights I‚Äôve done and bought lots of coke and realized tonight if I don‚Äôt change right now I will either die or live a life I hate even more. I‚Äôm just so lost - I‚Äôm going to AA on Monday and am scared I‚Äôm not strong enough to stay sober without the crouch of weed and a kid. That isn‚Äôt so filled with guilt.

I adore dreaming and creating a fantasy world where I can solve my problems and feel things in my heart. I have a therapist. I have medication. But somehow I'm missing a part of me. It was stolen from me during my childhood. This is where my innocence lies dead. Burred just like the missing part of me. Its been so long that the void has intertwined with who I am. I no longer fear it. I am content with it. Like accepting your dinner is okay but still edible. I have no desire to rip it's roots from me. It has created who I am. No matter how much the void takes away the true depth of happiness I could feel, I will never hate it. I'm glad it lets me feel fleeting laughter and similes before dropping me back into reality. It's like a sudden drop into an ice bath. It's almost instant. My void doesn't even let me embrace the warmth of happiness.

"As someone who is trying to learn all about depression and mental disorders (dealing with MDD), I came across a video about psychology that truly made me realize how much men are so underrepresented in aspects of why they commit suicide.

"Yesterday at 9pm, I was listening to that type of music that is relatable. It's kind of Midwestern emo. I was listening to that music because I felt like it and I just wanted to relate to something. I started feeling lonely while listening to it because of overthinking, and since I was talking to this new guy, I was like ""Wait, is he offline?"" So I went to check to see if he was offline since he still didn't reply to me, but he was online, and it made me upset because he left me on read for like 30 minutes, so I felt more lonely. I then ended up relapsing on self-harm since  I started truly loving him and it made me upset that he would leave me on read. I ended up talking to one of my online friends that I barely talk to. I vented to him about what happened, and he genuinely helped me. he gave me advice and affirmations and just helped in general. I later on told the dude I felt upset about what I did, and I got upset with him and he then said he was in the shower and whatnot, but he was online the whole time. We then resolved it somewhat, but I don't really like him that much anymore since he told me to vent to him, and I did; he didn't even help me or anything. I've dealt with guys in the past treating me like shit and all that. I'm tired of boys thinking they're superior to my attachment issues and shit. I'm just too broken to deal with men treating me like that now so that's why I have written some standards to show boys I see dating in the future maybe. I just want a guy to understand what I've gone through and not be dry or lame. I also don't like when guys say they're going to change just to never do so until things have gotten really bad. I just wish waiting for the one wouldn't take so long and that every guy I talk to is like a trial-and-error situation where I talk to a guy for a few weeks and they don't meet my standards so then I just talk to the next until I eventually find the one. In conclusion, I just dislike most men because of my experiences.",0

"i feel dumb putting this on reddit. anywhere on the internet, really.im a 19 year old trans guy, 20 in 3 days. i've not gone to college, i dont have a car, i dropped out of highschool due to extreme bullying and an abusive home life from my father, and i still live off of my family. every day i live knowing i shouldnt when i provide nothing. im a mass of flesh that people can laugh at when i make funny jokes. every day ive wished the many times i tried to kill myself as a teenager succeeded. even when i have a boyfriend, friends, and family that i at least think loves me. sometimes im not sure about the last part though. ive lost most of the family that gave a shit about me growing up.i grew up enduring trauma every day, and i use the pit it put me in as an excuse for my shitty behavior. i dont hurt anyone. at least i havent since i was a stupid child that didnt know how to cope with it all. all i know i have correct are my morals. i avoid hurting my close ones, as its all i have to do other than rot away sitting at a computer playing games. but i do nothing else. i cant even clean right, so im scared to. every time ive tried i did something wrong. ive always done something wrong. i managed to set off a house alarm by just trying to take out the trash to prove i was useful.i only havent attempted suicide again so i dont hurt my close ones anymore. but every day it gets really hard. i dont want to be 20 and i dread my birthday, because ive only spent every birthday with 3 people. one is dead, another doesnt talk to me much at all, and the other is in another country entirely for my birthday. i may not be alone because ill have one person, but all of the people that were ever there for me are gone. i feel awful knowing how different it will be. christmas of 2023 i at least had 2 but the one who died was missing and it wrecked me. i dont want to experience all 3 being not there. i dont want to be even older. i had to try really hard to not be at the house i normally stay at just so i wont try to hurt myself before i even get there. i dont want anyone to have to mourn someone like me. i wish they didnt care sometimes.its easy to see what i do have and take it as ""youre lucky you have that at least"" and thats true. ive actually only had this recently. growing up, all of my friends turned out to hate me, before making awful rumors about terrible things i didnt do. or growing a strong distaste for my depression and paranoia and outbursts, which i dont blame them for. i hate it too. most of my family had issues and were never there if they didnt instead hurt me. everything i have has only been here for less than a year. im not used to feeling kindness yet. and i hate it. i want to reciprocate it, but when they say the smallest ""i love you friend"", i feel genuinely only fear because i know in the end they'll most likely leave me with some form of hatred. they always do.i try to fix it. i want to be better. but every time i try i get knocked back down and i fall back into my pit of ""id rather be dead than happy"". its a way i get like 90% of the time. my hope only comes in short bursts.i love my boyfriend, my mom and my friends. i miss my cat and my grandmother. i miss people that hurt me, just because i want to feel less alone. i miss so much. im trying to live in the present and love who i have now. i wish it wasnt so hard. i wish i didnt feel like i may strip away myself from them one day just because of a passing impulse. ive called so many suicide hotlines and been to 3 hospitals. ive been to therapy, and on meds. i know the only solution is myself. i hate myself. i hate myself too much to do anything for myself. if i had a clone of me standing before me and a knife in hand, i dont think id hesitate to hurt it for everything we've gone through.its worse because theres no hope for me attractively either. the fact my boyfriend constantly says ""looks dont matter to me"" should tell you enough. im ugly, fat, have bad posture, and ridiculously out of shape. ive got nothing going for me other than the fact i hurt myself just to give to people. im nothing. a freak that shouldnt be alive. i shouldve died a long time ago.stupid to put this on reddit, i know. im just tired of annoying my friends with my dumb thoughts and issues. i dont really care about trolls or distasteful comments anymore. my biggest hater will always be myself. ive never heard an insult that was worse than what ive called myself. and ive gotten a lot of insults.",0
"I genuinely think there‚Äôs no reason to live.When I was a kid the love from my family made me want to live and I was so happy, but then when I became a tween I realized the importance of school friends, and when I realized I didn‚Äôt have a friend group to have sleepovers with or just a group of ppl that liked me, I wanted to kill myself.

"please i really need help trying to understand. there is nobody i would ever talk about these things to so i need online anonymity.why does it feel like no matter what NOBODY seems to want anything to do with me. I dont think people dislike me at all but nobody ever seems to want to even be friends with me. I do have a couple friends, and often times when i hang out with them they have various other friends over. many of the mutual friends i have met dozens of times, talked to dozens of times, but as soon as im not right in front of someones face im forgotten. not even worth adding on social media or anything. why?its probably not hard to figure out i have no luck with women at all. i had a ltr for about 2 years, about 2 years ago she broke up with me. immediately afterwards i was in a ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù type of deal and she broke that off with me after about 3 months. those are the only two girls ive ever talked to or ever kissed. both of them were the ones to make the first move and break it off.  since then absolutely nothing. but im always told that if NO women are interested in me then i have to be doing something wrong. it goes without saying it is honestly painful watching essentially all of my friends and all of their friends either in relationships or getting with girls. ALL THE TIME. ALL of them. i have to watch it with a straight face. its literally just me who isntand this sounds stupid, but the thing that honestly makes me feel so much worse is that i know im  decent looking. im also tall, im in decent shape, i have good hygeine. i hear from people pretty often about girls thinking im cute or good looking. but i honestly hate hearing that someone thinks im cute or wtv because that seems to be the only thing people ever have to say about me. and its obviously not enough for anyone to try even talking to me.the way i have been craving any intimacy or affection is fucking numbing. it doesnt matter how distracted i am it only takes something small to ruin my mood and make me on the verge of breaking down. every single night when i try to sleep i overthink for hours, often cry and eventually fall asleep. when i sleep most of the time when i dream its literally about girls, not even sexual lmao usually talking or affectionate stuff. its insane. its a mix of ppl i know irl or random ppl i follow on social media. it makes me feel like a fucking creep. there is no way for me to escape feeling completely unlovable and unwanted. I wake up and put on my social and happy face on and then repeat. i am so sick of feeling like thisi have been trying alot to distract myself and been following the tips to improve myself. I have been alot more engaged in my hobbies, as well as getting into new things, i have been gaining knowledge and learning new skills. i have been listening to new music, i have been buying and dressing in new clothing that i like. i have been working out and trying to be active in different ways. i genuinely really like the job that I have. i have been putting effort in to these things for close to two years now. i have noticed a difference in alot of ways in my life. i do feel happier generally, i do feel more comfortable in my own skin, while i am still pretty shy and im not super talkative, overall my anxiety has improved so much that i am surprised. why doesnt this matter? am i not good enough yet? i still havent improved myself enough yet?  i just want someone to want me. i want someone to think about me, i want to mean something to somebody. why doesnt that seem possible?im ‚Äúonly‚Äù 23 but i am really having a hard time not just giving up. i feel like time is running out. people always say stuff like ‚Äúthe right person for you is out there‚Äù. I cant wait years just to feel some sort of intimacy with someone (which isnt even guarenteed). and even then, at my current age let alone years from now, no woman would be interested in a guy who has almost 0 experience with women. nobody would be willing and patient to teach me, and i think its totally dishonest to believe otherwise",0

"Where do I start? I get paranoid, scared, cry nearly everyday. Cut myself regularly. Have tried overdosing multiple times on many lethal combinations of drugs in amounts that should kill a 250lb man. Yet, I'm less than half of that. And no matter how hard I try, I always wake up. I'm in my twenties, trans, (MtF)And that's honestly the only thing keeping me going. The only thing that brings me happiness. I look beautiful I'm told.But beneath all that is autism, .major depressive disorder, bipolar, manic episodes, PTSD, anxiety disorder. Who knows what else at this point. I'm very young in nature. I won't go into details such as that, to try to keep some level of anonymity. But it'll become somewhat clear to you.Im pretty dumb and naive. I ended up getting arrested and am still dealing with that and will be for awhile. They said I'd walk free, no charges, for $50k. I wish I had proof of that. But instead knowing that happened and that, being told by the judge they'd let me go if they could. I'm just now the worst I've ever been.I can't work due to panic attacks and manic episodes, rarely eat because I'm never hungry, have gotten a drug addiction that I control, meaning. I actively can set them down for a month+ at a time and not have cravings even after binging. I can't sleep without my plushie. And I have one that goes everywhere with me. I leave my place about 2-3 times a month. I live alone. Have no friends. Never figured out how to make them, despite being a ""likeable person"". No family. I don't understand how society or the world works. It scares me, so much I hide in my place. I hate life, the whole aspect of it. I do not find joy or excitement in anything but pain. And I can't keep living in this shitty world. I keep trying and keep trying to end it. And I always wake up. I don't know how. Junkie friends tell me it's due to tolerance because if they did what I did. They'd be dead. And most of them are atleast 50lbs more than me. I know I need to go to a psych ward. But if they put me in with the guys, I'll become a whore (not joking sadly) and it'll mess with my mental state even more. I also don't know if they'd let me bring my plushie. And if they did. I'm scared something would happen to him or they'd take him. He's all I have. So, we come back to, why the fuck am invincible. Google says they are lethal combinations. I do several lethal combinations all at once. It doesn't fucking work.So any advice at all would help. Ik this is meant for help but you can also help me by helping me find the perfect, failproof way. ",0

"Antidepressants have saved my life for years, but now that I left my job it is impossible to get mental health care.

"I've lived in the same rental home for 7 years now. Last week, the landlord told me she had decided to sell the house. I scrambled and found a new place in the same section of the city with my 2 current room mates.The anxiety of having to move everything is eating me alive, I am going through everything in this house and getting rid of things that don't need to come, and feel like I'm barely making a dent. Packing up the place I've spent most of my twenties is killing me.The new place is smaller, and slightly more expensive. My room is in the basement, which has a lookout with windows, but I still feel like it's going to be dark and cave-like.Its half of a duplex, I thankfully know the neighbors. But the place feels further from everything, the neighborhood feels cold, there's no fence for my dog anymore. The new place is about twice the distance from my girlfriend's house as the old one. I'm crying so often, and wake up in the morning with my stomach in knots. I can't hardly eat, and have lost 6 pounds in the last week from it. I feel like I am going to hate this new place, and I'm trying so hard to look at it as a fresh start. But I'm struggling with it so much. I tell myself that if I hate it, it's only a year lease. But in other moments, a year feels like an eternity. What has helped you with relocation depression in the past? I hate feeling like this.",0
"I‚Äôm a 27 f that fights with depression and anxiety. I manage to hide it mostly but when I finally and by myself sometimes it over flows. I‚Äôve been able to find medications to help my anxiety but meds made thoughts of suicide worst. I‚Äôm not going to kill myself. But I think if I were able to believe in god it would be easier knowing there is a reward at the end and a punishment for taking the easy way out. But unfortunately I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôve tried and it‚Äôs hard forcing myself through the bad days cause the only things that keep my is my niece and my cats. Cause they wouldn‚Äôt be able to understand if I chose to leave them. I don‚Äôt know how to not spiral on the bad days though. I just go home and cry or go to bed. I cannot afford therapy. All I can do is go to work and pretend to be ok. ",0
"I'm not saying I want to die, but if something horrendous happened and I end up dying, I think I'd be fine with that. I have no regard for myself and I'm having a hard time to really care about myself and others. I can't talk about this to anyone because they always have the same bullshit to say. They always tell me to look on the bright side and look forward to the future. Stop. Shut up. I do not care. I'm too tired to give a shit anymore. I feel like everyday I feel more sluggish and empty than the day before. I just try to push myself until my body and mind finally gives out on me.I feel like I'm being push and pulled every which way because everyone tells me their way is the better way. There is no better way. I've fucking tried it all.Just let me sad. Let me feel the way I want to feel. It's not like anyone cares or understands how easy it is to just fucking stay this way. Just let me give up. I just want to go home and melt in my bed and never get up or wake up. ",0

"Hey guys I‚Äôm male 29.Lately life became on auto pilot. No excitement. Not interesting routine. Nothing special.I‚Äôm also suffering from migraines and the last 4-5 months been hell. Constant pain 24/7 and other migraine symptoms.I started feeling sad before but nothing like today.Last 1-2 months I‚Äôm constantly crying for no reason I feel like life is not worth living. I don‚Äôt want to suffer. I‚Äôm crying and anxious I‚Äôm having panic attack out of no where to the point that I can‚Äôt breath !I started talking to this woman about 3 months ago.

She‚Äôs open sexually she‚Äôs done threesomes she‚Äôs Bi sexual and she‚Äôs completely what I don‚Äôt like.But on the other hand we have good connections we talk for hours, she understands me she fills me and she‚Äôs there for me even though I‚Äôm in the worse time of my life.I found out she‚Äôs not interested in kids the only way she would want is doing surrogate which I would never accept it. I want 3 kids and I want it the way I always dreamed it.Ever since I found it I‚Äôve been killing myself, I want to stop talk to her and one day I stop and I feel ok and I‚Äôm like whatever the next day I‚Äôm all obsessive and crying and her doing threesome or her doing what she do just triggers panic attack in me.My therapist thinks it‚Äôs not her I want is what she has provided me and gave me when I needed it the most. And I got attached and I‚Äôm afraid I can‚Äôt replace her.Idk..Idk if this depression uses her as a trigger and I don‚Äôt want her but it‚Äôs the fact I can‚Äôt have her due to all this situation.I just want to be strong and move on. I want to find someone who‚Äôs good for me and can fulfill my family needs and my future goals.I want to stop being sad all of a suddenI used to be the happiest person on earth and now I‚Äôm not.One day I want her the second day I don‚Äôt.It‚Äôs like when I see her she charges me than I don‚Äôt care much.

"I‚Äôm 22 years old, and have physically, emotionally, and mentally deteriorated significantly since end of 2023. December I started to have anxiety attacks and panic attacks, despite having no history or clear triggers. From there I lost and gained back a woman I loved‚Ä¶ the relationship has not proven easy. My health has also taken a turn for the worse this year, I have no idea what‚Äôs wrong with me, I‚Äôve been to the doctor, to a neurologist, and next a cardiologist. I feel physically like shit at least 5-6 days out of the week. I‚Äôve even developed issues eating, I‚Äôve struggled to even eat twice a day, I‚Äôve dropped from 178 pounds last year, now, to a measly 157. I personally feel like a pussy because of the constant anxiety and plethora of panic attacks. I‚Äôm losing touch with my family, my love, my friends, and especially myself. I‚Äôve fought with depression before, and have always held a strong mentality until this year. Nothing I do helps. I‚Äôve seen a therapist, I‚Äôm too afraid to try medication. I‚Äôm breaking at the seams, and I need any piece of advice or assurance that I‚Äôm not alone, or we all experience this, anything. I pray none of you feel this way, and if you do, you conquer this plague. Love to the world, Godbless. ",0
"I‚Äôm indescribably bored and like the title says I have no idea what to do with myself. I sunk like 60 hours into assassins creed Valhalla and I just suddenly don‚Äôt want to play it anymore. I don‚Äôt have any want to play, watch or do anything else. I genuinely just woke up today empty. I take Sertraline for depression and I missed a few (three) doses last week and felt pretty crummy but it‚Äôs been a while since then. It‚Äôs too hot to lie in bed comfortably. I just wish I wanted to do something I guess.  ",0
"I don‚Äôt want to live, really. I won‚Äôt off myself on purpose but I do dream about dying, and I find myself wanting so desperately to be the kind of story you see in a tragic romance, y‚Äôknow? I want to die loved. I want someone to give me their whole heart and to take mine and then I just pass away feeling like I was cherished, maybe even dying in that someone‚Äôs arms; that thought makes me feel so at peace and like I want it so bad. I wouldn‚Äôt wish that on anyone though ehehe.. I know that‚Äôd be a traumatic experience for that person and I never want to cause someone to suffer. Anyways, this was a pointless ramble after seeing a movie where the girl is sick and she has the boy take her out one last time and dies in his arms basically. I was watching and I just so badly wanted to be that girl. I want an end to the pain and for being loved to be the last thing I knew. Don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs cheesy or clich√©.",0

"For a little information, I tried to end my life last year but I wasn‚Äôt successful. I overdosed on my pain medication, I took a lot but it hadn‚Äôt been enough. Nobody knew about my attempt, I woke up the next afternoon and I threw away my goodbye letters so none of my family would find out. I do have BPD, depression, anxiety, and a few other things. Nobody knows about my attempt because I really thought it would work and selfishly, I didn‚Äôt want people to watch me closely. I‚Äôve been dating my boyfriend for several months now and he‚Äôs actually my first relationship. But I feel guilty keeping this a secret. I‚Äôve kept it to myself for so long and I have a history of self harm and other things. Should I tell him about that? I don‚Äôt know what to do. Growing up I was always told people don‚Äôt care about your problems so keep it to yourself but I see other people outside my family, say otherwise. Is it something I should tell him? I‚Äôm terrified of the idea but I feel like I‚Äôm lying to him by keeping it a secret. What would you do? ",0
"Hey everyoneI take everything personally and cry at everything. I cry so much that every morning I wake up with swollen eyes. I don't even know why I exist. I just wish that I were never born. And people in my family know that I'm depressed, but for some reason they don't care and roam around happily in the house. This makes me so sad because my feelings are not validated. I try my best to be normal, but at the end of the day, I just can't. There is not a single day I've slept without crying in months. And once I start crying, I lose control over my mind. I throw things away, start screaming, hit myself and lock myself up in the room because I don't want anyone to see how much of a psycho I am. I've tried therapy but it didn't work for me. May be because I got used to this depressed phase and may be I want to be depressed all my life. Please give me advice on how I can be normal and how to not be bothered about anything in life. ",0
"as a highschooler ive made terrible mistakes in my past friendships and social media in general and it has caused the people around me to hate me, everywhere at school i get really nasty stares and i know that they all hate me. for the past two years i have felt so miserable and depressed and my mom is not allowing me to transfer to another school because whenever i try to talk to her about it she makes it all about herself and it is just so pointless to try to tell her anything about my feelings because she will never understand me and i genuinely dont think i can deal with two more school years i just want to start over new and change my approach and make new friends but my mom has 0 faith in me and thinks that no matter what happens i am going to make the same mistakes at a new school. she has never had faith in me and is constantly looking down on me and it makes me feel worse about myself. im afraid to vent to my friends anymore because im scared to become a burden and drive them away. but i feel so horrible right now and i think that if nothing changes i am going to want to kms. i am in so much pain and my mom doesnt care and she never puts my needs before hers and nobody gives a shit about how i feel or what i want. it is always about her her her. i cannot take it anymore and i‚Äôd rather be dead than deal with any of this anymore :) i am sick of her selfishness and constant victim behavior when im the one going through shit. i understand she has her own issues and stresses going on but i am genuinely in a terrible place right now and i need help and support. i don‚Äôt know what to do about it and all i can do right now is cry about it and sit on my bathroom floor locked myself in here so that i dont try to kms. im in so much pain and i cant see when it will end.",0

And he messaged me, ""I can‚Äôt wait to share more happy memories with you."" Sweet right? Well, we weren't even together physically when he sent that. So I know the motive for this affection is because his favorite team won. I used to receive more affection like that regardless of how well his favorite team was doing. But now that we've gotten busy and we're 6 months into the relationship, it's less. Which I've come to accept and I'm okay with. I guess it just hurts that those kinds of messages come when baseball makes him smile, not me.

"Im only 16I wonder if there is anyone who can relateI remember being constantly upset about myself since I was a little child.

That lowkey sounds dark, but this is how it is.Whenever i remember this i feel pity. I feel miserable. All my life ive been miserable. When other kids were passionate about their hobbies, were making friends and spending their time outside i was in my bed crying on the verge of suicice.Things haven't changed. I dont remember the last time i was happy or woke up in a good mood. I can't push myself to do something. All i do is doomscrolling and crying. And i fucking hate myself because of that. I dont have energy, social connections, skills. I can't be loved. I dont deserve love or affection.

I'm a married man and a dad. But for roughly a year and a half now I've had feelings for a woman at work. Nothing has happened between us and there's no signs of her feeling the same way about me but in this time we have become really good friends. We communicate a lot and have had lots of nights out together and gone to football games together. I'm positive that I'm not her type and that she'd never go for me even if I was single which is a thought that brings me down all the time. I've not been happy at home few a years before these feelings started and I have asked for a divorce in the past but stayed for our son who has additional needs. The woman at work is on my mind constantly and last year when she dated another guy from work it was incredibly rough for me and I'm dreading when she meets the next guy. I feel depressed all the time and I feel like I need to stop being friends with her and maybe find a new job. Has anyone else been in a similar situation and what did you do to get past it?,0

"Pretty sure I've had depression since high school, and by now I've already graduated college. I always thought that keeping myself busy would help fight the depression, but it seems as though every day is harder and harder to get through. I can't focus, I constantly feel like crying, and my negative thoughts plague me. I recently got an internship at a law firm (around April), and my self esteem is so low that it's making me incompetent. I can't even make a phone call without panicking and making myself look stupid. I feel like I don't even want to do anything. Getting into a really good law school is my dream, but I don't have the mental energy to work towards it. I feel like every day goes by so fast but so slow at the same time. I don't have enough time to rest, but at the same time I just want to get the day over with. Apart from this constant stress and dread from worrying about my future and not feeling any energy to work towards it, I have no friends. Couldn't make friends in college. I was too scared of social interaction, and that held me back from making any meaningful connections. Now, I'm paying the price. All the bullying in high school traumatized me, and now I don't even know how to communicate like a normal human being. I've never been in a relationship either. I had a crush on a guy, and convinced myself that there's no way he would ever want me. I ruin everything for myself. Why can't I just live normally like everyone else? The daily things that are so easy for most people are so hard for me. I'm barely surviving this, and therapy is too expensive. I don't have the attention span to do anything. I'm losing hope and I'm pretty sure those around me don't want to be around all this negativity. I don't blame them but it reinforces my negative self perception.",0

"I know this is going to be a long read but I hope someone takes their time to read it and provide advice for me I've been depressed and suicidal for a very long time but really want to turn things around. I'm 26, got diagnosed with BPD and I have depression and general anxiety. I was a happy normal kid until 13 when my mom(who has mental issues of her own, daily panic attacks as long as I remember, childlike behaviour even at her 50s now) cheated on my dad and I got involved pretty badly, abuse and threats from both mom and cheater guy then my dad found out his mental went all bad since then he's been horrible to everyone and they are still together now altho divorced so anyways my relationship with my parents and sister are very very bad, they ignore my suicidal behaviours and blame my dysfunctional lifestyle on laziness although it's been pretty clear what they did to me fucked my brain up to a point even after 13 years I can't feel normal. They ask me why I'm being the way I am and as soon as I start talking about what happened back then my dad responds with "" I suffered the most i moved on why can't you "" mind you he was 35 and I was 13 at the time he doesn't understand what trauma can do to an undeveloped brain even after my therapist explained it to him. So yeah this is my story so far and why I'm here is cus I really wanna start living one day at a time, not let my perfectionist black and white thinking patterns not ruin my potential, stop emotional eating and physically undo the damage I've done in the last 13 years and also really really need advice on dealing with impulsivity. I'm planning to go to a library tomorrow and get sources on all of these topics and more and if you have advice or a source that can help me with this stuff I'd really appreciate it. Some days I feel like I feel every second it passes like tomorrow won't come altho I know it always will unless I die so that's why I wanna start living one day at a time so I don't just lay in my bed and let my mind go all over the places. I really do think life is supposed to mean something not just counting the days till it is over. ",0
"I'm a 20M, still lives with his loving and caring parents, have a nice paying job 100K+, have my dream car, have people that care about me, but unfortunately doesn't have the pleasure of enjoying life...Everything that felt amazing and loved to do has become painful and joyless, making music isn't fun as it used to, doing photography has become soulless and purely uncreative compared to what it was before, talking to people and trying to know new people has become in my eyes useless and annoying.A few years back during covid, I had started a depression that lasted for 3 years, wanted to kill myself constantly, I had some dark thoughts about taking a gun up to my mouth and just pull the trigger, or do it in a peaceful way and take pills before sleeping in hopes of never waking up again.I have always had issues with making female relationships, I've had a few in the past but nothing that lasted more than 2-3 weeks, I have this social pressure from my friend group, every single one of them has a gf,  being asked by my colleagues at work how come at my age I don't have a gf, has severely taken a toll on me. Feels like the only way I start enjoying things in life, is when I put my life at risk, like driving at high speeds but even then sometimes it doesn't feel scary like it used to, playing video games is now unbearable, I play for a few minutes and then turn off my pc, talking and doing activities with my friend group is now unpleasurable.I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like working everyday for nothing, I spend my money like crazy, hoping that the materialistic things in life would make a difference but nothing, feel happy for few hours and then get used to it, feels like an endless cycle of torture and pain for nothing.The dark thoughts are slowly coming back to me, I feel it, as soon something bad happens, my anxiety levels sky rocket, and the thoughts of ending life start as jokes. I keep saying to people as a joke, I would love to jump off a bridge, but sometimes it feels like I actually want to do it.I really don't know what to do, I just wanted to get this off my chest in hopes, it might have a positive impact",0
I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with me lately but I just don‚Äôt feel happy. All I want to do is sleep and be in my bed. I feel very lethargic especially at work. I am just like what is my purpose right now? I am getting my master‚Äôs in mental health counseling and I just feel like what if I don‚Äôt do well at what I am doing? Also. everyone is pressuring me to find a boyfriend and I just don‚Äôt have the energy to do so and don‚Äôt want to waste my energy on it. I don‚Äôt want to bother anyone so I keep everything inside but then it causes me to lash out ,0

I wish I didn't have dreams. i wish i majored in something that would get me a job and not some creative field. I wish i wasn't interoverted to the point i could only make a few friends in my college life. I wish i wasn't so easily jealous to those popular or sucessful. I wish i could be the child my parents are proud of. I am aware I put too much pressure on myself. But I don't know how to control it nor how to be happy with who i am. After college, what am I. How do I move on. I know no one can predict the future, but I am honestly crumbling with the lack of confidence and drive i am have for living.

"I'm currently trying to become a functioning member of society again, after spending the past few months severely depressed, sheltered in my parents house, staring at my phone all day, abusing alcohol and marijuana. Now, somehow, I'm going to the gym almost every day, looking/applying for jobs, and haven't abused substances in over a month. Despite my progress, I feel like I've hit a roadblock and have still been feeling empty, lonely and uninterested. Every day feels the same and even more boring than the last. I still find myself on my phone/laptop for 5+ hours a day and even that is starting to lose its appeal. The one thing I truly want to do is spend time and have meaningful conversations with someone, but there isn't really anyone in my life where I can comfortably do that with. I have a few friends, but they are too far away to see in person. Sure, I have my parents and my therapist, but conversations with them always feel awkward and I'm scared to bring up some things with them. Needless to say, I've been spending a lot of time alone, and I haven't been able to find anything to do by myself that I enjoy or am passionate about that might help me overcome depression. Why do I feel like I need someone else to feel happy? Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can feel more self-fulfilled?",0

"I haven't always been such a mess. For most of my life, I was doing really well, actually. Ranked top in school, attended top university, got a job at Fortune 500, climbed the ladder up fairly quickly, moved in between countries for prestigious jobs, founded a company, grew a team, had lots of friends and acquintances.Until one day (around 15 months ago), after many years of working super hard and burning out, I snapped and fell into a severe depression and anxiety.Since then, things turned different. Good things did come out of it though! I rekindled old precious friendships, took better care of my health. But for the most part, things have been pretty shit. I left the company I founded (with nothing on hand) after an unfortunate series of conflicts and bad blood with my business partner during my depression. I lost some friends and strained some family relationships. After my recovery, I ended up helping the family business for a bit but I've been going through a rought patch due to conflicts with my parents, which essentially stemmed from their low level of trust in me, so I'm likely leaving soon. I've put in a chunk of my money in my previous company so saving is thinning. I've been seeing this woman I really like but might have to put it on hold due to all of the instability that's happening right now. It's like Murphy's law, all crazy shits happening right now. I'm often stressed and sad.I don't know what to do, I feel lost, but I do need to pick myself up and rebuild again soon, moving to another country and starting over sounds quite appealing. I don't know what to do, but I'll have to figure something out soon. I'd appreciate any words of encouragement, I'm feeling very lonely and sad now.",0

"I'm not enjoying life. I have so much time to myself,  more than any person has any right to, but I don't want to use it.I wake up depressed every morning thinking about the same stupid s***. It can take me as much as three hours to finally feel distracted enough that I can do simple chores around the home.But then I'm back in place with nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nobody to talk to, and I wish I could just terminate my existence instantaneously.It's way beyond the point of possibly getting better. I'm in my mid-thirties, but I'm living with the same social and emotional deficit I've had since over *twenty years ago*. My life might as well have never happened.I'm like, decades deep into a situation where I can't make a connection with anyone. It's just too painful for me to socialize even in the most superficial ways imaginable. Every relationship I have or have had is unsalvagable as far as I'm concerned.It's just that now, I know it'll never happen. There will never be a turn around. I knew that ten years ago and it's still the same today. I'm just too damaged from the things that I've been through.Even if I could fix the worst parts of my life, and repair the relationships that have hurt me the most, I still have like, 20 years of depression and resentment to overcome and that's practically impossible - it's just not going to happen.So instead of feeling good about the day and setting myself up for the future, I'd rather just see the ending now and get it over with. If my life is going nowhere as it has been, I'm tired of playing the part.It makes me feel sad to see people much younger than me struggling here in r/depression with difficult situations, and I feel so badly for people who lose their lives without so much as a choice in the matter. Life doesn't owe me anything - I don't even deserve life. I wonder how long it can go on this way. How much worse will it get before I've had enough?",0

"- please I like can‚Äôt wait any longer for my sex drive to fix .

"I (19f) always felt like i was nothing, never really seen or heard, i was never important to anyone.

Not that anyone cares really, Im just a stranger. I don't care about improving on things anymore, I tried and I failed and even if I didn't, I'd still be miserable. Im tired and the only thing I want at this point is death. Just an escape from this cruel world. It's a shame I'll have to do it myself, those who made me feel bad throughout the years could finish the job, have fun one last time, but that would make it too easy for me.  As for my family, I never had a close relationship with them, my mother left me, my father is an emotionally unstable manipulative narcissist, so I don't think they'll care too much.

So, what did I do? I transformed my walk-in closet to a hideaway space. I've filled it with pillows and fluffy blankets. I have a fan in there to keep me cool. My laptop is in there, some of my favorite books, and a reading light. I added some electric candles so as to not kill myself in a fire. Also, they add some pleasant illumination to the place as I don't like harsh lighting. I prefer dim lighting so that my eyes don't hurt.

"Hi, I am 37 years old, and on mid 2023, I took a sick leave from the hospitality industry, due to overwork, insults and threats from the person in charge, hard demands from customers, and I decided to prioritize my well being. It was bad to the point that I hated living, and my self esteem went way down, I was told I had imposter's syndrome. Around December, and by being with family and through counseling, I slowly started to recover.During this sick leave, I decided I wanted to change industries, and despite being scammed by a web development school who told me they would 'help me' change careers and did nothing to help me, my morale didn't go down, and it was an ok test for me. It sucked but it is what it is and it could have been worse. Finally after months of looking for jobs, I got one with a decent schedule and salary and I was put in a big project, and I thought things were picking up again. Boy, I was wrong. I got assigned a trainer, who wanted to rush my traning, and she didn't care that this a new type of work for me, she exagerated saying ""she explained to me 1000 times"", when she explained me one or two times, and she did not like when I asked her for assistance, she ignored me when I asked for help in certain tasks, and lied to the superiors, saying I didn't type down anything, which is the opposite, and I typed down many things. And to be honest, I did an ok job for a starter, and it is normal to make one or two mistakes when beginning, but she doesn't see it that way. Then I found out she was putting me down to other colleagues behind my back, and even when I confronted her, she put on a mask and said that ""she would try to help me more"".I was wrong again, two weeks later I was kicked off the project, but not fired, now I barely have any tasks(which consists of cold calls and checking repeatitive sheets), and I am being told that eventually they will find a new project for me, and to bear with it. All my hard work to gain my self esteem back is now shattered again, I am afraid of being fired due to false information being spread about me(even though I have already spoken with superiors and they told me not to worry),I am not happy in my current role, and I just feel sad basically and doubting everything i do. I would appreciate any feedback on tips of what to do to try to get back on track, please. Thank you!",0

Hard part is that now I‚Äôm really fucking unregulated. I‚Äôm medicated, but those never really seemed to do much, and I‚Äôve been to therapy my whole life, and I even go to a dbt program now. I have going been for a year, and it‚Äôs been fine, but it‚Äôs not really doing anything. Everyone I know swears by it, and I feel like such a failure because it‚Äôs been such a struggle to really dedicate myself to it. My  therapist is great. Despite this, I DREAD my appointments. He always tells me to call him if I‚Äôm struggling, cause that‚Äôs like a thing in dbt, but after our calls I just feel worse. It‚Äôs not even him, either, he‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm at my whit‚Äôs end, and I know that it‚Äôs only my second day sober and I should just keep going, but every minute is torture and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I tried calling my parents, but they just tell me that it‚Äôs okay to be sad. I can‚Äôt get it through my head that maybe they‚Äôre right because it‚Äôs unbearable to keep feeling like this.

"I met him when I was 19 and he was 24 I think, he was my first boyfriend so I was new to the whole relationship thing. second time we hung out he introduced me to his girl best-friend, little did I know this whole time he was manipulating me into being in some kind of three way relationship that I did not want but because I loved him so much I tried to be okay with it and we had threesomes all the time. At some point it wasn‚Äôt fun anymore because I could tell the girl wanted my boyfriend and me out of the picture. My boyfriend did not do anything about it. after that it started being really hard for me to have sex with him because I felt so insecure and unwanted and I had so much anxiety that my body rejected him. It hurt so much while having sex with him I was dry, bleeding, there was cuts and I had recurring yeast infections. Even tho all of that was happening he was still having sex with me which made me bleed even worse (worst pain in my life) I was crying in front of him and he never seemed to notice. I was stupid for not having and boundaries I just wanted him to choose me and love me since I knew sex was so important for him. now they are in a relationship together and it makes me so disgusted and depressed how come I‚Äôm here still suffering from the r** my body doesn‚Äôt work anymore like it used to I feel like at this point I should just kms.

"I have been treating my depression for about 5 years with 30-40 mg of Methylphenidate daily and 1mg of Rexulti. The only thing the Rexulti wouldn‚Äôt solve was the lethargy which the methylphenidate helps with. However, sometimes I wonder if others who have had some success with stimulants to manage their depression have success stories with other stimulants. The cocktail I‚Äôm on was a game changer compared to everything else I‚Äôve tried (the list of anti depressants and stimulants I‚Äôve tried is about 40 items long). But I haven‚Äôt really tried other stimulants. During the valleys, what I‚Äôm on is still not quite enough. During the better periods I feel like I‚Äôm struggling but can manage.

"For context, these people that said these comments are aware I take antidepressants and that I have depression. They know I was homeless for four months and schizophrenic during that time, so they need to not hold me to the same high standards they give themselves. BTW my hygiene is decent. I don‚Äôt ever smell bad. But stuff like nails and hair get dirty because of the nature of my job.It‚Äôs not your responsibility to criticize a mentally ill persons poor hygieneExample 1: I got cornrows a month ago and I took them out two days ago. There were still knots and matting even after I showered. Today I FaceTimed my ex turned friend who lives far away from me and she gave me a verbal lashings because she has curly hair too and knows when the hair is starting to become dreaded and matted. I already knew my hair wasn‚Äôt looking great. I thought I‚Äôd FaceTime her before I shower, but I quickly learned that she won‚Äôt accept me unless I‚Äôm presentable to her. I‚Äôm convinced I can drop the friendship and find someone better who doesn‚Äôt verbally criticize me for 5 straight minutes about how unhygienic I am. It‚Äôs a behaviour that shows the person as completely devoid of empathy, from my perspective of a mentally ill person. The thing is my hair was clean. I just have difficulty LOOKING hygienic. I smell, feel, and am hygienic though. I went out to the nightclub the same day after taking my braids out and I was able to get girls numbers, and have a good time. No one batted an eye about my hair. I take antidepressants for depression as well as antipsychotics. ITS POSSIBLE FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH DEPRESSION TO GO OUT AND FUNCTION NORMALLY BUT STILL STRUGGLE.Example 2: The other week my friend with benefits and I hung out on a Friday night. I slept over at her place. I didn‚Äôt wanna have sex (low libido) but she did. I didn‚Äôt come. We did it twice. I had gotten called in for a shift so I left and she said she wants to hangout right after I finish work. I went to hers and she was traumatized by the state of my nails. I‚Äôm blue collar and my nails aren‚Äôt always cut very short because I frankly don‚Äôt think about it ever. But they‚Äôre still short just not skin level. So there was some dirt. I told her it‚Äôs not as dirty as she is saying. She kept telling me I can‚Äôt finger her or go near her private parts with my nails. Obviously it was a misunderstanding because I didn‚Äôt wanna fuck her. These type of friends can leave my life and it would be perfectly fine with me because they show me they have no capacity to show me grace. I want to be able to be a little bit ugly around my friends. ",0

"Greetings, people of reddit. I have a problem, and I kinda need someone's point of view in this. I have been nothing but a burden to my own family and friends in my 18 years of life.

It has been an endless circle of me trying to do better but fail time and time again.

"Alright, so i‚Äôm a 24 year old man and i‚Äôve been dealing with a breakup from a 10 year long relationship with my ex-fianc√©. We were both high school sweethearts and celebrated our 10 year anniversary earlier this year in feb, where i proposed to her and she had said yes, i was the happiest man alive, knowing i wanted to spend the rest of my life with this woman. What i thought was going to be forever from then on, only turned out to be a short, less than 2 months of being engaged, and she had left me with not much explanation of why. Since then, i‚Äôve fell into a deep depression that i haven‚Äôt been able to get out of. We stayed in contact for a few weeks, maybe a month, but i could already feel she fully let go of me and what we‚Äôd had, almost as if it was so easy and meant nothing to her. I can‚Äôt say that‚Äôs what she felt, but to me that‚Äôs how it felt. Not long after the month of talking, I noticed it was only me trying to initiate and regain what we had, initiate conversations, and then one day i got no reply‚Ä¶ realising that i had been ghosted and forgotten. This realisation broke me fully. I‚Äôm blocked on all social media as well. After a decade, was this all i was worth in the end? not even a respectful message saying that we should stop contact? Idk if i‚Äôm right or wrong to feel this way, but i feel disrespected and almost worthless to the woman i‚Äôd loved with all my heart and spent a decade with, both of us growing through our teenage years and into adulthood, just to be left and forgotten so easily.. We weren‚Äôt perfect, we had ups and downs, but we‚Äôd gotten thru it all thru out the years and had gotten stronger (at least i felt) as we grew together. I just been finding it hard to get through this, i‚Äôve deleted all photos from my phone, conversations, everything, yet she still haunts me in my dreams.i‚Äôve been living in another country the past 2 months as i get thru this breakup, but fr i don‚Äôt know what to do, because rn i have no job, no money and no friends so every day and night has been pretty hard mentally. I don‚Äôt know how long i‚Äôll be able to take this if im being honest.being away from my home country i‚Äôve stopped smoking weed and haven‚Äôt drank for these 2 months and even though im sober, i would love to smoke up at least lol.a whole decade of my life, and it all meant nothing.",0

"It's really just one of them days where you just think about everything and realize that you're not cut out for it. Life is not for me, hah. All of these thoughts just made me realize how sad I am to the point that I can't even describe it. It really is just a sad little life. My future is in my hands and I don't like it. The only solution I'm genuinely considering is killing myself. It was always that ""If I had money, it'd solve all my problems"", but, right now, dying is the only thing that could make it all stop. I mean I wouldn't do it (I'm a pussy) but I should. I really got worst. Since I'm a pussy, instead of thinking of killing myself, I'll put all my energy in waiting for one of my good days. Then I'll be back here in a few after putting myself in this condition again. I don't even know what I'm saying, but whatever. Who cares? We're all going to die. Mine couldn't come a bit sooner. ",0
"Hi. I‚Äôve been depressed most of my life, but things got especially bad the past few years - most days I could barely get out of bed. Moreover, I struggled with binge eating for a long time, which combined with a total lack of physical activity led to a pretty bad case of obesity.  Now I‚Äôm medicated and in therapy, and feel like I finally have enough motivation to start being more productive, but sadly my body just can‚Äôt keep up. Any kind of physical activity, like a few minutes of doing chores or a slow 15 minutes walk with my dog, feel extremely hard and uncomfortable. I start feeling extremely hot, and sweat so much that my clothes get damp. It gets so bad that often I just avoid going outside altogether, as I can‚Äôt do that without feeling extreme discomfort and exhaustion. I keep trying to be more active here and there, but it doesn‚Äôt get any easier, and I feel like I‚Äôm making no progress at all, which is really demotivating.    If any of you have been dealing with something similar, I‚Äôd love to hear what helped you get over the discomfort and keep pushing forward. Feel free to share your personal stories or any tips you might have. ",0
"Hi, 24F, been struggling to find a job for two months. I just used the washroom for the first time today and it‚Äôs 8PM. I can‚Äôt get out of bed, I barely eat, and haven‚Äôt gone outside in 2 days.

I‚Äôm supposed to be going back to college in the fall but paying for it is seeming unlikely. My ADHD, depression, anxiety or whatever is making me not want to live, just crawl into a ball and lie down until I fall asleep again.

I know it isn't healthy. I know I should open up more. But it's very hard for me to. Especially to someone who I care about and don't want to make them worried. I don't know what to do and I'm lost.

"I am a 15y/o male from the UK who suffers from depression and suicidal thoughts. I have been a 'smart' kid since very young in primary school. The reason I am smart is due to my parents overworking me since I could read and write. It started as 30 minutes of maths every day after school, which definately helped me with maths in school, and let me have an actual challenge as I quickly found it very easy to do what my school provided. By year 6 however (around the start of when covid was appearing) it had gotten to 45 minutes of work before school and 1 hour after at a minimum in preparation for my SATs (end of primary school test in the UK). For reference, other students were doing 10-20 minutes a day maximum. Because of covid, I never did my SATs. I got into a good secondary school as a 'genius' and was the top of my class in everything. I was predicted 8s in everything (in the UK we use 1-9 as grades for GCSEs, 1 being bad and 9 being good) as it was school policy not to predict 9s. I am now in my summer holidays after year 10, going into year 11. We did our first round of mocks just before we left for the holiday and I got 5s and 6s in most subjects (I take music, computer science, history and spanish for my GCSEs), apart from maths which I got an 8 and computer science which I got a high 7. The only reason I got higher scores in maths and computer science is due to me liking the subjects and having very good teachers for them. I strongly believe that it is my parents fault that I am getting scores this low on my test due to them making me do so much school work outside of school (around 1-2 hrs now). This has also lead to me having no social life as I am at home so much doing school work. The few friends which I do have are amazing and a large part of why I am still alive today. I feel like my parents are trying to use me as a mini them, doing what they wished they had done when they were my age, as they think that this will help me, however it blatantly doesn't. They both didn't do enough when they were young, and ended up only just getting jobs which get the overall household income to around ¬£80,000 for a family of 4, which is by no means poverty, but is also not anywhere near a good amount of money. I think they believe that making me do tons of work now will mean that I get a good job. I have heard them talking about me, and how they hope that they can retire early and live a rich life when they are old from my money (if I do somehow end up rich, I can tell you for a fact nothing will go to them).The issue is furthered by my mental conditions, and my parents denial of them. I can tell you for a fact that I am a sociopath, and am very sure that I am also autistic. I have talked to both of them about it, and they have laughed it off and said that they don't have it so I can't. We live in England, and have free healthcare under the NHS, all they have to do is apply for a checkup. Literally 10 mins per. Thats it, but they can't even do that for me, yet force me to do hours of school work a day, even in holidays.I also workout, and have for a while, leading to body dismorphia (thinking your muscles are smaller than they are) which has lead to many injuries from me working out more frequently and with more weight then I should have to try and grow them to an impossible standard my brain sets for me.All fo these factors have lead to me not wanting to live, and considering ending it multiple times per day. As I have previously mentioned, my friends are most likely the only reason I am alive. I know they could help me get through it if I tell them, but I can't bring myself to tell them, I don't know why, I know I should but I just can't.I know how I would (probably will) kill myself: I have rope tied under my bed which I have tied into a noose multiple times. I would grab the rope, get a bottle of bleach and a sharp knife, go down my road to a tree which I have tested the branches of and found a suitable one. I would climb to the correct branch, tie the rope into a noose around my neck and attach it to the tree. I would drink the whole thing of bleach, slit both my wrists (lengthwise), slit my throat, stab myself in the heart, and then fall off the tree to strangle myself. I know that it seems over the top, but I know that if I am going to kill myself then I want to do it, so this ensures that it will work.I put this out there so if I do kill myself, and an investigation into it happens, this will hopefuly come out and reveal how bad my parents are.This is a throwaway account by the way,I will look at this account now and then if I can remember the login details and am still alive (assume the latter).",0

"I was learning Japanese and was made fun of and accused of having a secret Japanese bf. I bought so many books and was so deadset on learning.

"I truly, from the bottom of my heart, hate the fact that I am indifferent about everything in my life. I am 30 years old, I have no friends, no hobbies, no job, no skills, no anything. I am effectively an 18 year old high school graduate with a decaying body. Every morning I wake up and try to think of any kind of goal or dream to purse and come up blank. Even if I were given infinite cash and resources to pursue a goal I would still be sitting on my ass wasting away. It pisses me off because WHY me? It feels like every single other person on the planet has something they want out of life except me. Why can't I have ambitions or desires? My desire is to have a desire and that isn't working out too well for me.I feel so much hostility and jealousy towards anyone I see online who has any kind of passion or drive, which is most people, and it heavily impairs my ability to form any kind of connection with anyone. I can't even fake it because I can't force myself to give a shit about anything a potential friend would care about.This goes beyond depression, it is the worst feeling on earth and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.",0

"I just turned 20 a few months ago. I doubt anyone will actually read this, kinda just want to type it out honestly. I really feel like I've failed at every facet of life. I'm very introverted, I held good grades in High School and before. I went to uni and bombed a lot of classes, and made very few friends. I've never been in a relationship before. I'm grappling a lot with my sexuality as well. The only thing I have going for me is that I'm in amazing shape for some reason. It's pretty much the only thing I haven't failed at since it's pretty easy for me. But recently I feel like there really is no tangible point to any action I do. I woke up last week and the realization hit me that I haven't felt happiness in so years. I can't even remember the last time I was happy. I have no hobbies besides playing video games, music, and drawing. I have a very hard time relating to others and forming meaningful connections. I don't really want to die or kill myself, but I don't really feel like existing. I'm tired of living in this world. The last week I've just spent my days staring at a bottle of pills I know could end it. I'm honestly terrified of dying. But I feel like I don't have anything to look forward to. I'm trapped, just floating around waiting for something to happen. I can't see myself in three years now that I think about it. I'm not a bad person, I'm just difficult to care for. I haven't had a meaningful conversation in over a year or two. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone ever feels this. I'm not diagnosed with anything, but I don't feel like this is normal. Does anyone have any advice? I feel like I'm utterly unlovable. I really wish I wasn't born most days. ",0

My therapist has told me that I'm giving my pain too much power and allowing it to take over but I don't know how to stop it. The intrusive thoughts are wicked and come at the most inopportune times. The worst part is that I can't be the mother my kids need me to be bc I feel like a shell of the person I used to be. I haven't tried medication yet but I'm thinking it might be my last resort. I just want to remember what happy feels like. ",0
Alone depressed Anyone What's the point of going on like this Nobody's my real friend ,0
39/F- Idk if I‚Äôm depressed. Medicine and talking doesn‚Äôt help how I feel. I‚Äôm sad most of the time where I can‚Äôt remember being happy. Idk if it‚Äôs just my brain or if my life does suck. I look at social media and I see lots of tragic  stuff and think well my life isn‚Äôt that bad‚Ä¶ and then I have conflict at home with my kids or their father‚Ä¶ and I just get right back thinking I‚Äôm so tired of getting everything wrong. I think think think‚Ä¶ and I still do the wrong things. Is it depression when u think everybody hates u and ur not good enough? I can‚Äôt handle it when i hurt peoples feelings‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt handle when they tell me I did something to hurt their feelings. I feel attacked a lot. When people are distant to me I feel like it‚Äôs my fault somehow. I get easily overwhelmed and I get frustrated with my kids and I feel like I screwed up my first two sons. Now I have a toddler with another father. Who helped me with them but their real dad doesn‚Äôt believe in meds and therapy so we never got the help with their issues. Both dads feel like the kids just needed discipline. The first two kids have adhd. And I‚Äôve always been told I‚Äôm too nice. They‚Äôre doing a lot of reckless things and I fear they will end up dead or in jail. Then I have a toddler‚Ä¶ i decided to plan a pregnancy with my bf at the time. A constant cheater ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I don‚Äôt even remember why I thought this would be a good idea. Because I thought he was a narcissistic abuser. He kept cheating. And I have been miserable with and without him‚Ä¶. I regret making the baby because now the father feels like we have to keep contact. Then said well I think our son needs us both living together in order to have a fighting chance and be diff than ur other kids‚Ä¶ and then recently he was diagnosed with Autism. It was a sad stressful pregnancy‚Ä¶ so idk. Idk if it‚Äôs just my life is full of reasons to be depressed or if I‚Äôm being a cry baby or a snowflake. The dr‚Äôs diagnosed me with depression but I think I have ADHD or maybe I‚Äôm autistic too‚Ä¶. They won‚Äôt evaluate me for ADHD or Autism because I‚Äôm too old. ,0
"It's the only thing that's actually giving me satisfaction, the fact that I have a way out makes me so happy. A way out from this lonely, friendless life I've had. Nobody has actually ever loved me or given a shit about me. Literally NOBODY. I've never had friends in my 28 years of life. I can't stand this life. It's a farce. I can't wait until I pull the trigger. ",0
"Recently, I‚Äôve been doing really good mentally. I talked to the crisis hotline recently over a short episode but besides that my relationships with family and friends have been good. Tonight though, I started feeling‚Ä¶ icky? in a sense? I have somehow started to miss the feeling of being so deep in a spiral that I would just sit in my bed for hours listening to music and just dissociating for hours. I miss the friends and world that I made in my head as a coping mechanism. The problem is that now I have nothing to cope about. I‚Äôm happy and doing well but I hate it. I hate being happy. I hate that I‚Äôm not so mentally ill that friends drop me. I hate that my family isn‚Äôt constantly yelling at me.",0
"I haven‚Äôt showered in over a week just because I don‚Äôt want to look at myself at all, or be naked for a long period of time. Even though I‚Äôm all alone when I shower, it still feels embarrassing to take off my clothes as if someone is watching me do it.Although I can go days without showering because I‚Äôm unemployed, graduated, and hardly leave my house, I know that it will affect me in the future. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to keep living miserably like this, I don‚Äôt want to keep wasting my life focusing so much on who I want to be or look like, but I don‚Äôt know how to stop.I hate everything about myself so deeply. I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll ever be able to accept or love myself. I can‚Äôt even look at other people without feeling jealous of their looks or their voices or their talents or their personalities. I can‚Äôt even enjoy being around my friends because I‚Äôm so embarrassed of who I am.I don‚Äôt just hate my looks or my voice or my body, I hate my personality. I hate who I am naturally and the way that I think. I hate what I‚Äôve become and who I have hurt. I hate the decisions that I have made and the time that I have wasted.I don‚Äôt know really know what I expect from this post. Comfort? Attention? Sympathy? Advice? I guess I just want to feel less alone, or heard or something. Thank you for any advice that you may give. It‚Äôs deeply appreciated.",0
"Hi. This is a pretty open-ended question, but how do you get better? I‚Äôm in therapy, I take medication, I journal, and I actively want to feel better. But, my depression/anxiety always comes back. I can distract myself for a period of time, or I‚Äôll go through a couple of weeks where it isn‚Äôt as consuming. But it never lasts. I understand that mental health will always have highs and lows. But my lows are just too low that it‚Äôs unbearable for me. Will my life always just be this? Having to distract myself from my own mind just to have a semblance of peace from time to time? I don‚Äôt want that. Life isn‚Äôt enjoyable living like this. So, if there are people out there who have found what works for them, please share.",0

All I do is get pissed off at her for it. I DONT WANNA FUCKING GO ANYMORE. personally dont feel it's helping. Sure it's teaching me some life skills. Supposedly. But is it really helping my metal health? No it's not. If anything it feels like it's making it worse.

Every god damn. 3 words she has to put the word RIIIGHT? at the end of everything and it drives me absolutely fucking insane Why can't I just say.

"Hello everyone,I've been struggling with depression lately, and it's been really hard to manage. No matter what I do, I can't shake off this overwhelming sadness. For instance, even when I accomplish something good, I still feel deeply sad, almost as if I want to disappear. It's confusing because some days are objectively good, yet I find myself feeling inexplicably down.Everything seems empty, and I feel like I have to constantly put on a facade, as if nothing can truly make me happy anymore.

"I think my mum has depression or something because she doesnt know how to look after herself and i dont know what to do because im moving out in a month and i dont want to have to give up going to university because of her, but i still want her to be okay so im just really confused.she doesn't ever tell me when she is feeling ill or if somethings wrong either so i might be missing some stuff but she does a lot of stuff that I dont know how to help with and I feel like with me gone and her alone she wont be able to look after herself, like she cant hang clothes properly and she doesnt really do things like leave the house or shower often which i know might be a lot to say but I dont know im just so worried about her and i feel like a failure or something for not being able to help. Ive thought about hiring a carer but even if i get a job when i move out i know that chances are i would barely be able to afford one for her, especially since they would be really expensive but I just need someone who would take her out of the house and help make sure that she gets out of her room and looks after herself. She never goes out of her way to talk to me or my sister either, she only really asks us for money for herself since she smokes a lot and spends a lot of it on that, and I dont know how to get her to stop smoking without sending her to some kind of rehabilitation centre but I dont know how I would do that or afford that in the ukshe lost her car a few weeks ago and hasnt left the house in a really long time either, so I believe she has depression but she doesn't want to go outside and shes really scared of going to the doctors or the GP so im not sure how I am going to get her professional help maybe i can get a therapist to visit her at home? Im sorry im just really lost I still want to go to university in September but im so worried about her and I really want her to be okay when I move out but I dont know what to do or how to help her at all. I'd only be able to visit her once every few months since im not going to have much money after paying my own rent and university bills.

"I got diagnosed with MDD, Anxiety w ocd symptoms and PTSD. I have no friends. All the friends I had were either from highschool and I moved away from my home state anyways which means I haven‚Äôt seen my family in years nor do I have the money to get on a plane to see them. I don‚Äôt have the motivation to pour into my old hobbies nor the money to get into new ones I might enjoy. I hate every job I find myself working at. I have no dream job. I‚Äôm socially awkward to a disgusting degree. I find most social situations to feel like improv. Forced to act right in the moment. I always try to feel out other people‚Äôs personality and adjust to what they‚Äôd like so I‚Äôm always exhausted and anxious and disconnected from social interactions. I‚Äôm off medication because it was messing with my body. I get high everyday because I usually desire the feeling of happiness even if it‚Äôs not authentic. I spent a lot of my free time almost in pain at how mundane life is, how cruel and disgusting it is, how I‚Äôm always so vulnerable in new relationships platonic or otherwise and people can smell it on me. Which is why I have no friends now. I had a best friend who broke the worst boundaries someone can break so there goes years of friendship down the drain. I have a boyfriend but I don‚Äôt always want him to see how much I hate being alive so I‚Äôve stopped talking to him as much about my feelings.

"One of the main sources of my depression since early childhood.  My father left my mother when I was 3 weeks old.  He cheated on her and is now married to the woman he cheated with, which is our stepmom.  As part of the divorce it was arranged that we visit our father every other weekend.  On these weekends, he would wine and dine us with video games, movies, and restaurants...nothing we would ever experience in our mother's home.  It was genuinely a good time and carefree but shortlived and hollow at the same time as he would simply pack us up and drop us off like luggage when the weekend was over.  Upon returning home, my mother, mostly silent would be doing the dishes In mostly dark house and I can remember just sinking into depression thinking about her loneliness and being left with 3 kids to raise on her on.  There was very little fun in my mother's household and I don't know if I can blame her.  I have to believe she did the best she could even though she could be abusive at times.  Being a male often wondered why I wasn't placed with my dad, instead I was in a house of all females (2 older sisters) and always the odd man out.  I had to watch my step brother grow up with the childhood I should've had.  I wanted to play football, not allowed.  I wanted to play an instrument, not allowed.  All these things left me predisposed to depression so when my friend committed suicide I spiraled into a deep depression alongside substance abuse because I didn't want to live anymore either.  I've never brought up my jealousy or resentments to my father and always just stuff it inside.  I'm 45 bow so it really doesn't matter but the depression and I'm wondering what I can do to heal these cycles life has burdened me with.  I have a reason to live but depression threatens all my goals.  Thanks if you've read this far any words of wisdom are appreciated.",0

"Okay so idk how to get over this but I have to quick. I go camping next week for the first time in 12 years. (I'm 22 rn), and I have really bad bathroom anxiety, like I straight cannot pee or shit in the woods. My bladder just won't let me get all of it out, soemtimes a little comes out but usually not even close to all of it til I can get to a decent toilet. Even some portapotties and gas station restrooms I can't pee because I get anxiety. Then I start panicking and won't pee at all. I'm really scared about this for camping. There will be no bathrooms as we're camping in the woods and going for 3 nights. I also can't back out of this trip because it's my boyfriends birthday and he wanted to do a camping trip with friends. It's making me really depressed thinking of even going",0

"Hello everyone,I want to share my situation and get some advice. My main language is Spanish, and I'm about to finish my senior year in the US. I was born and raised in Mexico until I was 8 years old. My family moved to the US mainly because of the poor economy in Tijuana at the time. I learned English and continued my life here, but I always noticed that being an immigrant without papers comes with many limitations.A couple months ago, I talked to my parents about the possibility of returning to Mexico to finish college. I want to become either a doctor or a nurse, and college in the US is too expensive and difficult to get into. In Mexico, not only is it cheaper, but I can also attend a very prestigious medical school.Here's the thing: I'm scared. I'm afraid of ruining my life by returning. I would live with my grandparents in a decent, wealthy part of Tijuana, but I'm not the brightest student. This last junior year was my worst, getting Ds and Cs. I'm not sure about the process or what I need to do. I don't know what to do, and I'm scared of it. I know I don't have much time left, but I want to do something with my life. Leaving the country I've spent more time in feels weird and scary.Please, someone provide an opinion. The school most likely l will be attending if l return is the university of xochicalco Campus tijuana. From what l heard is a very important school in the city.",0

"I‚Äôm so lost and nothing has helpedIm a 21 year old male and I‚Äôve had major depression since I was 7, and recently diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar last year. I have been going to psychiatrists and psychologists and all the others since I was first diagnosed and I just keep getting worse. I have little to no social life, I don‚Äôt really hang out with anyone, no one talks to me. Even if they did I wouldn‚Äôt know what to do because I have such shit social skills. I am a terrible eater and constantly eat stuff that‚Äôs bad for me leading to me gaining quite a lot of weight. I‚Äôve noticed that I‚Äôve stopped enjoying things that I used to like and now all I do is just lie In bed and watch YouTube. I‚Äôm currently at uni studying something that I‚Äôve always wanted to and I am looking forward to what I‚Äôll be doing after but I‚Äôm failing quite badly, I‚Äôve done 21 subjects so far and I have failed 9 of them, I‚Äôm going to get kicked out if I fail any more, I‚Äôve got no motivation to go to any classes and I panic and get stressed when I try to study. I‚Äôm living on college but it feels like I‚Äôm the odd man out in every friend group and event. Every time I go out to bars and stuff I get into my own head that no one wants to talk to me. I‚Äôve been taking antidepressants and all sorts of other medications but I‚Äôve found they lose effectiveness quick. I don‚Äôt enjoy going home during uni breaks even though I love home, I find myself getting very agitated and angry at my parents very quickly and I don‚Äôt know why. I find it extremely hard to talk to my parents about anything especially not how I‚Äôm feeling. I also find it hard to talk to professional help as well. I have never had a girlfriend or any of that and I haven‚Äôt had a job for 3 years. I‚Äôve had many suicidal thoughts pretty common and I‚Äôve even attempted suicide a couple of times. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm at risk of suicide currently but I‚Äôm just so lost and I have no idea what to do",0
"Hi, this is me counting down the days of my life. i probably would be gone soon and I kinda want to tell my story to anyone who had the time to read. This is the summary of my 27 years on earth.At the age of 5, my parents separated - mostly because of me. My father is a deadbeat truck driver who would mostly beat up my mother because there is no more sugar for his coffee. I would often witness him throwing the empty tupperware at my mom when they quarrel. I don't know if they knew though, as they would mostly leave me at the care of my maternal aunts and close our house when this happen. No one said anything. Even I, thought it was normal for them to fight. So when my mother left and went to the capital city to find work (we were living at the province that time and my mom is a teacher), I wasn't surprised. I was used to being left with my maternal aunts and basically had no close relationship with my mom back then. I was even closer to my father. Then, that happened. It might actually be the straw that broke the camel's back when it came to my parents' relationship. I was a mischievous child and I liked going to the water pump with my friends to bathe. It might be my bad timing, or the fact that my mom had just left, or maybe my dad was too drunk, or the fact that I was literally a child, but at that time, my father got mad with me. Like mad angry. He chased me from the water pump with his belt and layed it down on me until we reached our house. I don't remember much after that, but I remember it was a whole debacle. I was bruised all over for asking my dad for a fckin shampoo sachet. I was five.Later, I remember my father apologizing to me. But really, what can a five year old understand from that apology? He told me it was my fault, that I was naughty, and I annoyed him to the point he raised his hands on me. And at this point, I've always been close with my father, so when he ""made me understand"" that it was my fault and ""apologized"", I really accepted that. Maybe I'm at fault. Maybe I was the problem. Maybe I deserved getting beaten because I asked him for a fckin shampoo. I then learned that one of my mom's cousin reported the incident to her, and the next few months were a blur. I moved with my older brother who was 8 years older than me, my mom's cousin (the one who reported the incident), and my mom's younger brother, to the capital with my mother. Then, I had a semblance of somewhat of a normal childhood, but I would still be left alone most of the time.I understood, and I don't really blame my mother for anything. She was already trying her best to provide for us and make ends meet. I know this for a fact, and coupled with the fact that I still blamed myself for my parents' ultimate separation, I seldom asked for anything and kept everything to myself. I would mostly just do my own thing. I was often left in the care of my maternal aunts. And I was wasn't close with my brother - first of all, the age gap, second of all, I felt my brother's hostility to me. I knew he also blamed me for our parents' separation and uprooting our lives. My brother is already in highschool at that time so I don't blame him.Then, I fell in love with writing. I fell in love with books and being able to create a world of your own where everything just falls into place. It became my outlet, my secret garden. And I apparently had a talent for that. I became an active part of the journalism club when I was in elementary and highschool. I even competed and won in writing competitions. I also became editor-in-chief of our school publication. I was smart. I was good with maths and science, and never had a failing grade. I had a talent with words, I was good with my hands, an artist, and even joined the school band as a drummer. Aside from these, I was even part of leadership roles in school and graduated as Vice-president of student council. These achievements carried me to the peak of my school days and also became my downfall.I was labeled as ""that child"". You know the one with good grades and the one every teacher liked. But no one really liked me. I was ostracized for having a speech disability - I was born with cleft lip and palate. Out of jealousy, one of my classmate, and my ""bestfriend"" when I was in elementary scribbled a not-so-nice slur on my test paper. A test I had perfected. It turned out to be a big debacle, and I found out that my classmates never liked me. The ""friends"" I thought I have never truly appreciated and accepted me for who I am.But I was naive. I wanted to be accepted. I started hosting elaborate sleepovers just to hangout with friends. I will often go home late at night because I'm hanging out in someone's house. I even started to force myself to people because I wanted to find somewhere I belonged. It backfired I think, because the more I wanted to be accepted, the more people rejected my company. I had this fiery and stubborn personality and I think this just added to the repulsion. When it finally dawned on me that these people never liked me, and kinda accepted that, it was the end of my highschool. By then, I don't have any friends. I don't have any real connections to anyone. I turned to anime, online games and social media, and actually got accepted to related communities. I actually made friends who actually liked me for who I am, and I was genuinely happy.It was different in the real world though. The more I gained friends online, the more I lost touch with reality. My relationship with my family also worsened. Because I was labeled as ""that child"", I was often compared with my brother and my cousins. Hence, you can understand the hostility. The only ""friends"" I had were the ones which were forced by circumstances. I would often find myself forcing a relationship, but it wouldn't work out in the end, so even now, I still grieve all those wasted effort.Because I was labeled as ""that child"", there were a lot of expectations on me when I entered college. But the thing is, I never wanted to be ""that child"". I wanted to be a normal person, not someone who apparently became ""successful"" by overcoming their disability. I don't want that kind of burden. I never wanted that kind of burden. I was not that child. I'm just me. I only wanted to be accepted somewhere. I only wanted to be accepted by someone. So then, I failed. I failed my classes. I got a failing grade in one of my major subject and almost failed the others. And you know what happened? I was honestly relieved. I was no longer ""that child"". But the reaction of the people around me were different. Some rejoiced and gloated at me, others, like my mom was thoroughly disappointed. And then I realized, ahhh, all this time, I was ""that child"". The irony.All this time I had been escaping that label, and when I finally escaped, I realized that my only purpose is to be ""that child"". So, I felt useless. I felt this kind of despair that every thing I did was useless. I am useless. I'm so useless to the point that I am so powerless in proving my identity. I am not me. I am ""that child"". Because everything has been getting onto me, I brought up the topic of mental health with my mom and told her that I need a break from school because I might have depression. She told me that it's all just in my head, and that I'm just irresponsible for not managing my time and my life correctly. So, it was again my fault. I had to be that child. If not ""that child"" then who am I? So I did. I transferred at a local collage, continued my studies in something I don't like and donned the identity of ""that child"". For another 4 years, I had this mask, and I think it worked. I became ""that child"". I made new relationships and I genuinely thought I finally found somewhere I belonged. Despite for the fact that there's always this hollow feeling in my chest -- It's screaming, this is not me. I'm not ""that child"". Why do I have to do this? But if I am not ""that child"" then who am I? I finally found people who accepted ""that child"", if they knew that I'm not ""that child"", then I'll be left alone again. So, I silenced that voice.And because I pretended to be ""that child"", I passed both civil service exam and my board exam on the same year I graduated. I even graduated with honors and as president of our department. Throughout my years in the leadership position, I also helped my classmates in thesis preparation, helped my underclassmen through math tutorials and actually built myself back up. Even before graduating, I was already on the running to a position at my dream job in the national government. A few days after passing the civil service exam, I got a call from my dream job and signed a contract and started that same day. Things are finally looking up to me because I became ""that child"".Eventually, I got a permanent position and things just went downhill. It's true that the light is the brightest before it goes out. I tried so hard to be ""that child"" even in my job, and what do you know? I did excelled. I excelled so much to the point that expectations just kept piling up, responsibilities kept piling up, everything kept piling up. And I was burned out, I can only go so far with keeping up this fake identity. I dedicated everything to be excellent in what I do, but the jar is broken. No matter how much water I put it, it still leaked. I finally had an opportunity to consult a doctor because I had my own money now. And I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. Because of this the things I built crumbled and eventually my job was affected, my relationships were affected, my health was affected, and now, I'm alone again.I have no job. I had to quit my dream job because everything is just too much. The disdain my director had for me plagues my nights, and I can't even begin with the eyes and whispers of my coworkers. They didn't take too kindly that the usual passionate and hardworking coworker had exhausted her fire.I have no friends. I only had a relationship with people because I was ""that child"". I helped a lot of people, even connected jobs to them but no one reached out. I have no family. My mother wants to disown me because I'm no longer ""that child"". My brother never cared for me and remains hostile because I had always been ""that child"". My family members are hostile to me because I was ""that child"". There are a lot of underlying issues and even now, my mother blames me for not having relationship with any of her family members. They don't believe in depression, they say it's all just in your head.Even if I want to get help with my mental health I don't have any means to support myself. I live alone and even my bills are now piling up. Everytime I open up to someone, they always just say that they had worse and that I just need to go out more, or go to church. They tell me that I am not depressed, it's all in my head. And the thing is, I'm kind of convinced at this point that this all just in my head. I'm just irresponsible, I'm just lazy, I'm just sad. And now, I'm honestly tired. I want to beg God for another chance in life, you know, one of those isekai tropes.At this point, I'm just broken beyond repair. I've already been ""that child"" my whole life and built everything I had in that identity. The thing is, I'm not ""that child"", I never was. It was like a character in this game called life that I made in order to complete quests. And now that it's game over, I realized that this character is flawed. This is the story of ""that child"" who lived for 27 years. I feel like this is my last cry to the universe for help. People around me used to tell me that I only need to say something if I need help and they will help me. The thing is, I did. But no one listened. If there's someone out there who can genuinely help me, please, I'm desperate.I don't have the courage to start again, but I also don't have the courage to take my own life. So, I've been starving myself. I don't harm myself outwardly because people will notice and raise questions, and honestly, I'm too tired for any confrontations. At this rate, I might die before the year ends.I will take my life on the last day of the year, I don't know, I might not actually make it. I plan to take these last few months to prepare myself, like a countdown of sorts. I plan to finish trivial matters in the coming months so that when I eventually leave before the new year countdown, I know I had no lingering matters.Deep down, there's a voice in me that still wanted to live. The same one I silenced a long long time ago. But that voice may just be in my head. I don't know.I guess this is goodbye. I just want for someone to know my story that's why I'm posting here. I pray for you who had read this far, I genuinely thank you for reading my story. See you in the afterlife? Just kidding üòÇ",0

For context I‚Äôm someone who is suffering from severe anxiety and depression and want to take some antidepressants but am worried about its effect on my daydreaming and overall imagination as I can‚Äôt do that much anymore as my daydreams aren‚Äôt vivid anymore and are more just vague pictures In my head rather than full on detailed movies and I‚Äôm worried that if I take any antidepressants that it‚Äôll kill off whatever is left of my daydreaming/imagination abilities overall. Did the antidepressants you guys took kill off your daydreaming completely or did the opposite effect happen to where it made it worse or more vivid than before? ,0

"To start off I'm diagnosed with both severe anxiety and depression since age 9 but i think it has recently gotten a lot worse.

The house is also part of the issue, i stuggle with getting anything done because I'll just walk into a room and see the mess and it sressed out that i just want to cry.  I ghosted all my friends because i cant get myself to talk to them, its like theres a wall in my brain that i cant push through. I hate going outside because other people just irritate me and make me close to a breakdown. Every week i feel like im getting worse and worse, i feel frozen and stuck in a endless cycle that only stops when my entire family is out of the house for a few hours.

Everything has grey fog in my head and I‚Äôm so sad. ,0
"To give some context, I am very shy and have never had a conversation even close to romantic with a woman. For the last few years, I sometimes feel depressed and feel like a failure when I see attractive women. For example, sometimes it ruins my workout at the gym because I just want to leave and get away from everyone.Unlike a lot of people who experience this, I have zero trauma that I know of. I've never been bullied, have great parents, and I am content with my appearance. I think I know why this is happening: I am attributing my self-worth to my success with women, which is causing me to become depressed. But how am I supposed to fix this? No matter what, I just feel incredibly lonely all the time. I've also heard that it's not good to get into a relationship to ""fill a void"" but I'm not sure what else to do. Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",0

"Every thing I do now, I think, you just did that to get attention. I cut myself on my arm, ""you just did that so that people would notice and pay attention to you"" I cut myself on my other arm, ""You just want more attention, you just want people to look at you"", I cut myself on my upper arm, so that it would be hidden by my sleeve, ""You wanted attention though, that's all you wanted, for people to look at you"" When I talked to my brother and dad about my depression, I could only think afterwords, you don't care what they think, you just want to make yourself the victim, I've even came up with a suicide plan and I told my therapist and my dad, and I only thought, ""you would never actually have the balls to pull the trigger, so theres no reason to event tell them, the only reason why you did that is so that they'd give you more attention"". And that is true, unless something truly broke me, I don't think I could ever kill myself, which just makes me think that the thoughts of suicide are just me trying to make myself the victim, since so many others have it so much worse. This is only made worse because 80% of the time I'm completely normal, than for days/weeks at a time I just think, I want to die, please kill me, I want to be shot so badly. in that 80% time I'm the happiest I could be, you couldn't even tell that I've been sad before, than I realize, wow, I hate myself suddenly. Even now making this post, I just think, you just want these people to pity you, to reaffirm your self-pity, to boost your ego. I haven't really seen a post about this, so If anyone else has experienced this, can you tell me please?",0
"A few nights ago I had some really strong rum like 40% it was a little less than half left , before I did that night, at that point I was already drinking 5% Smirnoff for weeks, like at 4/5 each night before bed then some times I‚Äôd just drink all day so by the time as I got this drink I was feeling like it would be nothing because I was feeling tolerant, and whiles drinking it and I drank the rest of the 40% straight from the bottle I was fine and I was even looking for more, by time as I went to bed though I felt like I had poisoning I had all the symptoms threw up every second had the runs barely could‚Äôve breathe like just taking short breathes couldn‚Äôt breathe and really was feeling out of it I felt I could‚Äôve fainted , my body was aching so bad , and just tried to see what I could do if I drank water it made me like so that‚Äôs what I did then I remembered that day I didn‚Äôt eat so on top of the drink I didn‚Äôt eat so I was really gone , the next day I was dealing with the symptoms all day felt like it would not stop, it has been a few days now things are better but my body still aches and my throat aches from the throwing up all that time and violently, I discovered that based on how much you drink and your tolerance alcohol can send you away whiles your unconscious like sleeping, I still feel these side effects and with my life and how it goes , I would be so happy if I can go in my sleep aside from a gun or anything else painless and quick sleep would be the best, I‚Äôm so done with everything I really am I want God to please put me to rest forever please God please , why did I have to live like this why does my mother hate me I want to go , and lay in Gods embrace I feel like it‚Äôs warm like a pillow, every time I think about him and my situation he‚Äôs the only person I can ever trust I know there would be no doubt that he would not want to ruin me , God is all loving, I want to feel his warmth, I know it feels amazing and I know you would feel heard and understood by him there‚Äôs no hope here but I can have hope following him, come for me God please come, I sometimes don‚Äôt understand why he leaves me , why bring me to you God instead.

"I was doing so good. I have my project car, and I replaced a starter, worked with dad replacing the fuel pump, diagnosed electrical. I kayaked, studied grammar, read Faulkner, cleaned my car, talked to my family. I felt on top of the world this weekend. I cut off my ex because I saw she was with another man. I accepted it, accepted she often wasn‚Äôt nice to me, and that I could move on and I was not ugly, or stupid, or less a man. But depression is back after a hiatus, a little climb to normalcy, and a slide back down the emotional ski slope. The regret is hitting me, and the brain fog, and all those nasty thoughts (you can imagine what they are) associated with depression. All back again, in the waves I‚Äôm familiar with. It‚Äôs back again starting tonight for who knows how long. She broke me down so bad four months ago. It‚Äôs broken me as a man. I don‚Äôt have the same drive anymore. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôll survive grad school when I go back. I‚Äôve bombed four interviews, and I‚Äôve just been stuck half-assing at my little cube job. Why is depression in waves? Why does it have to come back every time?I‚Äôm just going to watch YouTube until I can sleep. Back on autopilot at work tomorrow.",0

"I have found that since becoming a parent, I am much more sensitive to overstimulation and absolutely snapping. I have suffered from depression for most of my life but manage my symptoms enough to survive with the help of Wellbutrin. My depression tends to manifest as rage and intense anger.

I almost always end up yelling and it‚Äôs increasingly including swearing which upsets my husband. I feel so sad and ashamed; I know they are kids being kids but the noise and chaos is literally killing me from the inside out. Is there ever light at the end of this seemingly endless tunnel?

"From the highest highs to the lowest lows.

Want her back, don't want her back, hate her, miss her, know it's better for both of us, think it's her that left, realise it was mutual.....All over the show.And now all I want to do is rebuild my life. Alone. And I have such amazing opportunities in front of me. I'm healthy, I have the best job in the world, I have money in the bank, no kids that live with me, an awesome teenage lad that I want to share life with and show him the world, I'm fit and still young enough and good looking enough I think...And yet I have so much I want to do and achieve and I can't make myself do it all. I do the bare minimum.....train, eat ok most of the time and work as much as possible so I stay ahead financially and have options....I'm in such a good position, and yet yesterday I tied a noose and all I had to do was step off the chair and it would all be over.Now today, I'm happier.Man how the fuck do you cope with these emotions and ups and downs.I rotted in bed till 12 today. Got up and did all my training. Felt really good after spa and sauna and thought fuck it I'ma have a drink and some shit food because I feel good now and start being the machine tomorrow.But it's not part of the plan that is me being a fucking machine all the time and becoming my absolute best self....But it's not so bad....I feel at peace with it right now.Random rambly post I know....",0

Its not like i can't talk to girls, i actually can have very good conversation with woman its just that they never see me in that way.

"this is going to be a long post, and i know nobody is going to see this, much less read it for that matter but idc atpim not even supposed to be living right. im an accident, a mistake. i don't even know my own father. all i know about him is that he is/was an illegal mexican immigrant and that's it. i don't know his name, history, nothing. and to be honest, the world constantly reminds me that i serve no purpose at all, that im just some blight to be eradicated. i grew up in a poverty ridden household with a mother who was incapable of caring for me properly. fuck, i can't even remember much of these years, probably due to me repressing these awful days. i can hardly recall anything these days. anyways, because of this, my mental growth was stunted significantly. i came from a curious child to becoming timid and withdrawn. little did i know that this would become one of my critically problematic traits up until this day, but i had way more problems to worry about than that at the time. my old home was a constant battlezone of physical and mental abuse. i suppose i have gotten so used to it that i hardly even reacted to it. i was about 2-5ish at this time. i recall having a cat for one year, until she died of poisoning. i saw her die in front of my eyes. the sight of her dying is still engraved into my mind years later.moving onto me finally going into school. i started preschool when i was about 3-4. every other student excluded me from their activities. i wanted to be friends, i wanted to forge a connection with them, i was so desperate to gain any sort of human contact outside of my family. but i was constantly excluded. i used to play by myself because the other kids didn't like me. and the one main question that still comes up every now and again came up: what's wrong with me? a concept that young me was too complex to grasp, but finally came into understanding much later. one girl, however, treated me with kindness, but im not sure if we have ever been friends at all. fast forward to kindergarten. this same girl came with me to kindergarten, but she made new friends and i was essential forgotten about. another student, however, did actually treat me with kindness, just like the previous girl did. but after thinking about this for some time, i think she only did this because her older brother was friends with my older brother (note: all of my siblings that i mention are my half siblings, we don't share a father). of course, she had people whom she'd prefer over me. this is an important aspect in this story that will continuously show up.come first grade, and a new student arrives to our class. i try and make conversation with her, which, to my surprise, she actually takes interest in me. this would be the first friend that i have made in the 6 years i had been alive at the time. i used to look forward to seeing her everyday. we used to hang out on the playground all the time. she had even took an interest in making mud pies with me, which was my favorite activity to do at recess even though id create a mess on my uniform. this, eventually, comes to an end. me and my siblings abruptly move to my older brother's grandparents house for about six months, cutting off my one and only friendship. i had to quickly adjust to the new life that i was so suddenly thrown to. i went to a new school. frankly, it was better than my old school, it was bigger, had better teachers, i got to take a school bus to school (i lived close to my previous school, which didn't require a bus), and the playground was a vast wonderland for 7 year old me. but there was one issue: i wasn't able to click with any of the students. at all. after 6 months, i move back to my city into a place, that i will simply put, call an absolute living hell that i will stay in for 7 years. i swear, that place probably took years off of my life. not like i had that many years anyway, but i digress. i go back to the old school and reunite with my old friend. we go back to hanging out. meanwhile back at home, i finally meet my stepfather, who i will be referring to as satan in this story. satan made my life, as well as the rest of my siblings life an absolute shitshow. i had a good impression of him at first, but as time went on, i realized how evil this guy was. the place that i had moved to was essentially a shoebox of an apartment. hardly any space at all. this apartment was a basement that constantly flooded and had roaches, mice, flies, you name it. i have seen maggots under appliances in that place. because of the constant flooding, we had mold and mildew infiltrate the air. becaus there was hardly any space in there, my siblings had to sleep in the living room. and you can forget about air conditioning; there were no openable windows in there. satan never went outside to smoke, i used to inhale smoke all of the time when i was trying to sleep, and id wake up with my throat hurting. there was no washing machine, so we had to wash dishes on hand or walk 20 minutes to the nearest laundromat. and because of the flooding most of the clothes would smell like mildew for weeks on end. the place hardly got cleaned, and when it did it was because my mother went into a fit about how me and my siblings were dirty even though the whole house was dirty. it made no sense. she and satan used to argue almost all the time, which put a toll on my already diminishing mental state. again, more physical and mental abuse, just like the first residence i was in. i could never get the end of it. i had nowhere to go.while all of this occurred at home, my friend invited me and another friend of her's to a sleepover. this would be my first and only sleepover to date. but when i arrived, she seemed disappointed that the other friend didn't arrive but i did. i thought nothing of it at the time but came to realize that she preferred the other friend over me. and yes, i did have a fun time, but i didn't want to go home. i really didn't want to go home. i wish i lived with my friend but, obviously, this wasn't possible. while i was gone, my siblings had messed with my stuff, going thru my things and the like. i was obviously upset but nothing was ever done about it. after the end of 2nd grade, my only friend leaves, never to return. once third grade begins is when the real downfall begins.i don't really remember much from 3rd-5th grade other than the fact that i was bullied by basically my whole class. i was even bullied by the teachers. the main reason was for being ugly. i was practically tormented during these years. i tried talking to my parents, teachers, counselor, anybody really, but nobody came. because of this mental anguish, my grades began to take a nosedive. i became more unfocused in class as time went on. grades were the last thing on my mind due to being bullied. satan, however, didn't see this as a choice. he yelled at me, berated me, etc, all for something that i couldn't control. my mother did nothing about this, she constantly ignored me, which i think is even worse than berating. IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT I WAS GETTING BULLIED. but no matter what, my crystal clear cries for help fell on deaf ears, every single time. my environment just caused me to completely shut down and try and seal myself away from the world.middle school is where i got the brunt of the bullying and abuse at home. but, amid all of this bullying, is where i met my second friend. he, too, was a new student. i approached him and we became friends pretty quickly. my feelings of platonic affection for him rapidly blossomed into feelings of romantic love for him. during this time, i realized i was bisexual. but i felt wrong for liking him. i thought he could never like an ugly creature like me. me and him would always pass notes in class. i always used to draw pictures for him. even though i loved him like i never thought i could, i never confessed my feelings for him. he was my first and only crush to date. i wanted to go on so many adventures with him, i wanted him to see my feelings without me saying a word. but that never came to light, all because i was a pussy and never confessed. i always think about what we could've been if i had confessed.then, suddenly, my life took another u-turn. me and my younger siblings were taken away by child services due to my elder brother reporting the treacherous conditions that we were living in at the shoebox. my siblings and i temporarily moved to our great aunts house. during this time, we transferred to a new school. i never got to say goodbye to my friend. i liked this new school, just like the other school that i went to in second grade, it's just that i wasn't able to connect with anybody. and then, covid hit. me and my siblings eventually went back to the shoebox temporarily until we found a new place. i was overjoyed that i could finally leave that terrible place behind. but, because of covid, i couldn't return back to my old school.in 2021, i graduated middle school amidst the pandemic. i wish me and my friend had graduated together, but unfortunately that wasn't possible. this would eventually kick off the empty and most depressing days to date with me going into high school.the new place was pretty cool, though we hardly cleaned it. old habits do tend to die hard. because we hardly cleaned that shoebox hell, we didn't clean this place either. me living at this residence was short lived, and we moved to another place nearby, which is where i currently reside. this place, too, hardly gets cleaned.back to the school subject. i have not gained one friend since stepping into that dreached place. i hate going there. i hate attending there. at my age of 17 you would expect me to be part of a friend group or have a romantic partner, but i don't have any of those. i am basically a ghost around school. nobody pays attention to me, even though i try to make my presence known. i have cried in class multiple times without anybody batting an eye. during freshman year, i finally realized that i am a trans male, though i have never told anyone. i feel like it's too late now that i am a senior next month and the whole school essentially sees me as a girl. i hate it. it makes me want to kill myself, makes me want to erase myself from existence. which brings me to the main topic: why i want to die.that novella that i just wrote is one of the reasons. i hate my past, i don't think i could ever recover from it. there's a ton more stuff but that is just the tip of the iceberg, as well as stuff that i can't think of at the moment.reason #2: my siblings. specifically, my younger siblings. my siblings have destroyed everything that has and had made me happy. i used to have a fish lamp many years ago, and i recently remembered that one of my younger siblings destroyed it. i had gotten gifted a lego minecraft set for christmas one year only for my siblings to destroy that as well. my siblings have also destroyed prizes of mine. my siblings always try and push me to my limits because its ""funny"". it's actually detrimental to my health. the main culprit, however, is my youngest sister. she always finds a reason to make me yell and make me upset. she always gropes me, saying inappropriate things about me, saying my deadname out loud because ""haha funny lol XD"", moans in my ear, goes through my things, etc. i hate her. hate isn't even a strong enough word. and yes, i have told my parents, i have told my school counselor that always says to go tell my parents. there's nothing i can do about this.reason #3: nobody cares about me. like i said earlier, i am simply a blight upon the world. people go out of their way to stay away from me. nobody really shows an interest in me. i have no special attributes. when i talk to my school counselor, she looks disinterested, like im wasting her time. remember when i said that anyone i become friends with prefers someone else? well, my friend from middle school had just recently ghosted me, which makes me friendless again :Dthere goes 5 years down the drainreason #4: im just disgusting. i didn't ask to be born into a female body, especially an ugly female body. i really wish i wasn't born at all. my conception could have easily been avoided. im sick of living as something im not. i haven't come out to my parents out of fear, but at this point idc, i don't have anything to live for anyways, or any reason to live. and yeah my younger sister doesn't know im not a girl, but it still hurts all the same when she calls me that. serves as a constant remember of someone who isn't really me.there is a lot more that can go in this post, but im not gonna write a book about my whole life. i hope someone hits me with their truck tomorrow. and thank you, for whoever cared enough to read through this whole thing, about my stupid worthless life.",0

"Today I was listening to old indie songs I loved in high school and it brought me back to you. I somehow transcended to fall of 2017 - I drew you killing floor 2 zeds - one of the many games we were obsessed with at that time. Many things are still tainted by you. Orange Halloween lights, pumpkin scented candles, Riftten, Kharjo, the smell of wet grass early in the mornings. When skipping class in college I can‚Äôt help but to remember us skipping school to play bloodborne. A game we once easily played over a dozen times is now the most difficult thing in the world. As i enter the hunters dream, suddenly back in time. It‚Äôs all so vivid. I‚Äôve always had detailed imagination, but it‚Äôs been getting more intense recently. Maybe it‚Äôs due to my depression getting worse, maybe it‚Äôs because you haven‚Äôt spoke to me in two years, or maybe it‚Äôs because im finally accepting the fact that you are never coming back and my worst fear came to life - you in love with your new girlfriend, your forever and I was nothing more than an ex you wish never happened. In these rare moments I drift back to you, i drift back to 2017, 2018, and the last few months of 2019. It all feels so real and I wish I could just stay there forever. I know it‚Äôs not real but my god it feels like everything never happened.. like reality was all just a nightmare. ‚Äústay with me forever‚Äù is what you always say to me when this happens. If in some way this is the afterlife then I wish I was dead. In this reality I am pretty much dead to you, but there, you are just as you were years ago..",0

I know it‚Äôs a dumb reason to be truly depressed about or even suicidal but I can‚Äôt control it.

"Today was a more taxing day than usual. Disruption at home compounded woth some realizations from self-help audio books. 1) I was listening to ""Avoidant"" while driving around today. The book has me identified to a T, like, scary-ass today's horiscope has your full name and address level accuracy. Listening to what it is to be an avoidant-dismissive person and how one becomes this way had me relive alot of the crap I went through in my life, ticking the boxes as they were described. Then, how I damage those around me. . . Once again ticking all the boxes. All the while, not feeling all that much save for being drained. As if an hour of listening to this was the equivilant to working 4 hours out in the heat. It just struck me as one of the strangest experiences I have had in awhile.2) Increasing fights at home with my wife. She sAyS she wants my oppinions, thoughts, and feelings.... but just like my father and step mother, they are always wrong. I hate the trap. ""What are you feeling?"" Proceed to painfully tear down walls to see what may or may not be emotions... then when I share them, ""WTF, thats stupid. You can't feel like that. Thats wrong. You are wrong."" At this point, I can't tell if I am being kicked because I AM wrong or if the alexthymia has me rattling off something truely stupid. Like someone learing a foreign language for two weeks before thier vacation.... just to sound like a complete fool to the natives. Then the surprised pikachu or feeling offended when I later turn down discussing anything. I know as a human I am 'supposed' to have emotions, they are not supposed to be easy... but I find I just emulate them now and that angers people more than just being a cold machine. I don't know if I want to be 'fixed' or 'accepted' anymore, but either way, it sapps my energy as well.3) My flirty infatuation with The Reaper has been intensifying over the past year. Going from a bad evening here and there of, ""I'm better off gone"" to 7-10 days straight where my idle (and sometimes intrusively) I would rather be making my exit stage left. There is alot of planning and alot of almost finding peace in knowing I have an exit strategy. It doesn't bother me, but I know it is supposed to be wrong. Like the points above, this is also sapping my energy. So now I am this hisl just fumbling through things. Getting berrated around every corner by everyone, while also getting, ""why do you look so spent? Tired? Sick?"" I dunno, you try driving a car woth holes in the gas tank and see how far you get in the day to day. Anyrate, there is today's rambling as I try and defrag my thoughts on all this. Guess it helpped me kinda breakdown and organize my scattered thoughts somewhat.",0

"I don't really know what to put for this title.I think I get attached to people very easily. I don't know. I don't know how to word this. I've texted the suicide hotline, and I grew attached to the people that texted me, I had a lot of things to say, but they didn't do much. All they did was repeat what I said back at me. They said they cared, but I know they didn't. But then I cried when our conversation ended. I wanted to talk to them more. I wanted to be someone important in their life. I hate it! I've grown attached to other people I don't know, but I don't want to tell anyone, because everything I've said so far is embarrassing enough. Also I am 14. I want a therapist, but I'm scared I'm going to grow too attached to them. I'm going to leave them eventually, too. They're going to forget me. I also have grown to hate therapists, I don't know why. Maybe it's because they charge a lot, and then complain when clients complain about it. Therapists pretend to care, that's literally one of the biggest parts of their job, but...I don't know. I hate them, but I also admire them. I don't think I want a therapist or someone else who only helps me because it's their job and they get paid, I just want someone. I don't know! I noticed a few things, I only get ""attached,"" to people who I don't know much about, work with emotional stuff, I only get attached to women, maybe it's because I don't think a man can get as emotional? Is that sexist? I feel more ok being vulnerable emotionally with a woman more than a man. I don't know, I think I'm just ungrateful. I think I want a mother figure, but I already have a mother. I don't talk with he much, and she annoys me a lot. I hate myself, I'm just an awkward, ungrateful, wierd little brat. I remember making a post on another subreddit saying that I wanted to die and why. I don't want to die now (at least not nearly as much as when I made that post) and I also have grown stronger in my beliefs. I want to do big things, but how can I do that when I'm like this? How can I do that when I'm like a stupid little child that wants to be hugged and held and do the same to the other? I'm so immature, good lord.I might delete this later, because this is embarrassing. I don't know if this was a rant or something, but this has made me wonder what's wrong with me. If you've read this, I hope you have a lovely year, though it looks like this year is turning to shit. ",0
"Im currently having a mental breakdown after reading a crash report which resulted in a total loss and the opposing part car overturned. I am at fault. In the report it self it is completely false from everything that had happened prior to the accident itself. It stated ""i was in the left lane, didnt want to wait in traffic, switched lanes then rearended my car ending up on a hill"" I NEVER SAID THAT because i have complete memory of the events prior to that. This is a 5 lane highway. I was in the 2nd right lane from the shoulder the entire time in this accident. Prior i wanted to switch back into the middle lane (3rd lane) but I saw that traffic was moving too fast so i stayed put. I saw the right lane was empty and wanted to go there to slow down just in case if anything happened but saw the lane was fully stopped so i stayed put. There was a box truck stopped in the 1st lane with no traffic infront of him. Ok odd i thought to myself. Then a moment later the cars in the right laned swerved to the left while stopped into the 2nd lane (my lane) which resulted in the driver in front of me slamming on there brakes so i do as well. I was already giving distance and space and knew i had enough time and space to stop if needed. In a span of a second or so the car in front of me was fully stopped. AND I KNEW THE LANE TO THE RIGHT OF ME WAS CLEAR SO IN A LAST DITCH MOMENT I TRIED TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT. It wasnt enough next thing you know i hit something and im up on a hill. I was fully aware of my surroundings and Was paying full attention to what was in front of me. My story never changed from the start of to the end. I never lied or fabricated the story. Prior to being in the 2nd lane i was in the 4th lane a whiles back. But i saw they were slowing so i switched into the 3rd lane waiting for a moment then switched into the 2nd lane. I was in the 2nd lane for a good amount of time bc I had my brakes and was slowed down significantly prior to being in the 2nd lane. And saw that i was also slowing down so I gave space and saw the box truck stopped to the right in front of me. While i was in the 2nd lane i wanted to switch to the 3rd lane but couldnt becaude the speeds were too fast and i was already slowed down. The thing is whenever im in the left lane and see traffic slowing down I ALWAYS SWITCH TO THE RIGHT LANES because i dont trust people in general. I always wait before switching multiple lanes staying in the lane before switching again. How am i supposed to live with this and fight the 2 tickets unsafe lane change and carelessly driving. The report said they had statements from an off duty officer as a witness. I WAS NEVER IN THE LEFT LANE PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT... And now people are calling me a liar and that theres footage of what i Said. Ik what i said and it wasnt that i never said i was in the left lane and didnt want to wait for traffic. And i never did any unsafe lane change to begin with. The car in front of me was a white jeep cherokee which was the vehicle that overturned. The damage to my car shows that as well. It says that i rear ended but it was the right end of the car which made it flip. If i rear ended then why is the car flipped. I was driving an escalade. Idfk what to do. I judt want to give ypm i am lost. Idk what to do. I want it to end. And better yet my mental state after the accident has been shit. Even when questioned by the officer i was in distress. But i know i didnt say what the report said. I have my therapist to back me up. I NEVER FUCKING LIED OR SAID THAT EVER. Idk what to do i have a lawyer thats helping me with the ticket but with the crash report idk what to do. I dont fucking know what to do. Ik i have shit memory to begin with but when it comes to traumatizing and stressfull evens like this I have perfect memory of what happened. How are they gonna say that I lied and disnt tell the truth. HOW. My lawyer is my uncle. I dont have money to hire a new lawyer. I dont fucking know what to do. I wanna just end this already.

"I recently had a conversation with my gf when we were both drunk.  She told me that she feels her life would have been so much better had she stayed with an ex that cheated on her with 2 to 4 other people.  She's said similar before, but this was the first time I actually thought about how she clearly doesn't care about me.  The same day, I Googled some symptoms I've been having and could rule out 6 of 8.  One of the possibilities is that I have cancer.  I have pets who probably have about 4-6 years left and I'm thinking I should just let it happen.  I don't know if this is a normal reaction of if I should be seeking further help.

Next year is my senior year of high school my parents are making me take 4 AP classes. This year I only took one which I could hardly manage so i don‚Äôt know what im going to do. On top of that my parents want me to get at least a 1400 on the SAT and i might be able to but it‚Äôs just an extra thing that i have to worry about. I‚Äôve never been motivated to study for some reason and depression is going to make it so much worse. Plus I never knew how to make friends and I basically have none so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôll be able to ask my friends for help or something. And I have to apply for college and I have no idea where I want to go or what I want to do anymore. I used to have interests but nothing makes me excited or happy anymore so i just play video games. I literally see no way out except suicide or going to therapy. I already talked about therapy and some of my issues to my mom said she‚Äôll find a therapist but nothing ever happened and I really don‚Äôt want to bring it up anymore because I just feel like im burdening them with my ‚Äúproblems‚Äù while they‚Äôre stressed about their work.I hate posting stuff like this because I know a lot of people on this sub are going through much worse and I don‚Äôt even have it that bad and im still young but I need advice or something please,0
"Damn it. I've been on a pretty good streak for a long time, I hate to feel like I'm sliding downhill again. For a bit of context...almost two years ago I was fired from the worst job I've ever had, that dragged on for 11 agonizing years. It was a blessing in disguise and it led to me finding the job I have now, which I love. The hours are great, my co-workers are awesome, and I finally have weekends off to spend with my wife. I've been riding a high from that ever since I was hired. I feel so grateful for finally finding 'my place' that it feels wrong to be depressed, but here I am.The condensed version is: My wife and I are still living in our 'starter' home. We started out in her apartment, then moved into a duplex, and then after a really rough 4 year search, found our first house. It wasn't without it's hiccups: Of course we had a really limited budget, and then the only type of loan we qualified for that didn't require a down payment stipulated that we couldn't live within a pretty huge area. That being the case, a lot of the basic amenities we hoped for were cut off at the knees, and it seemed like we were always $10K short of being able to buy what we really wanted. We ended up in a pretty small 900 sq ft home in my home town (which I had really hoped to leave behind) in 2009.I can't complain, it's been a great little home, and I'm extremely thankful we have it. At the same time, we had hoped to live in it for 5-10 years and then find our 'forever' home. My mother moved us around a lot when I was a kid. I was constantly being ripped free and transplanted somewhere else. As I became an adult I vowed I wouldn't live my life that way. I wanted to move as few times as possible! So when I say forever home, I literally mean the one I want to be living in when I die. Within the last year or so, we've begun talking about moving, and have looked at a few places. As I'm sure most are aware, the housing market is absolutely nuts right now, and has been for a while. We're in the middle of a severe shortage of affordable housing. When we found out how much we were approved for, we were excited, and thought that all the hard work was finally going to pay off. Then we started looking and found out that, just like our first home buying experience, we're just short of being able to buy something decent. The part that really kills me is, we're not looking to live in a mansion. We're extremely moderate, we'd just like something a little bigger, like 1,100-1,300 square feet. Just enough so we aren't tripping over each other. I really hate to sound entitled, but after kicking, punching, and clawing for everything we've ever had, it'd be nice to have ONE thing go our way.Again, I feel terrible for complaining, since there are a lot of folks that don't have homes, or are struggling to buy their first house. I guess I just thought that by mid life, we might be able to see some of the fruits of our labor. Instead I feel like there's no point in continuing to look. I feel like we're going to be stuck in our cramped little house forever. Thanks for listening. ",0
"It's been months of this and while I'm doing much better now than before as now it happens once every other week it still sucks. Around February- mid April it was multiple times throughout a week where I'd feel like this. Just incredible loneliness and feeling betrayed by those I trusted and having to let go of the woman whom I still have feelings for. The love is Definitely going away but I'm afraid the love will be replaced with hatred. So many times I think of her now and I just remember how she used me to buy her a uniform which was almost $1,000. How she'd say some incredibly selfish and hurtful things to me whenever she was mad because she knew I never raised my voice to her or said things to hurt her. How she'd love bomb me in moments where I would potentially not be in her life anymore to entrap me. The nonstop gaslighting she did whenever I'd tell her how she did or said something wrong and not just when it was towards me but others as well. The inconsistency of her feelings towards me of 1 day saying she loves me and then the next saying she didn't. I could go on and on of all the toxicity of that relationship but in the end it was other people that broke the cables back. It was false stories told by others that made me realize I had to cut her off from my life yet even that hurts because I hate the way I did it. I just told her to go back to thinking I'm dead(it's a long story that someone else caused and I had to fix when I found out it happened) and that was the last thing I said to her in December. Once I'd remember the great times we had like when I took her to watch the 2nd miles morales movie and she wouldn't stop gushing over it for a week. All the laughs we shared like when I called someone whom we both knew a ""potato"" because of how incompetent he is and she loved that joke. Or when she'd feel incredibly sad and just needed me to be there for her so she'd cry on my shoulder or chest. How she lost both her jobs and I got her a new one so she wouldn't have such a sheltered life. The times I'd hear her tell me she hadn't eaten all day not because she's not hungry but because she felt so low she couldn't bring herself to move so I dropped what I was doing and drove to her favorite food stop(taco bell or popeyes) got her her favorite order which I memorized and brought it to her while she was at work. All those moments we shared and just like before I can go on and on of how amazing they were. Yet all I feel now is regret and sadness. I miss you B but for the sake of my own mental health I need help that you can't give by being in my life again. I have to keep you blocked on everything and stay no contact. No matter how much it fucking hurts.",0
"Why cant i at least just fake it and make it seem like im happy. I hate talking about my emotions let alone acknowledging them. But its impossible to hide from them. Even if i try to suppress my emotions and ignore the depressing thoughts, it still finds a way to show on the surface. I hate it. I cant even wake up without feeling somewhat like crying because i just wanna go back to sleep and stay asleep. There‚Äôs so many things i want to do but it all seems like its not possible for me to even try. Why do i have to be here. Everyone says everything happens for a reason, everyone has a purpose in life. Whats my purpose. Coz it seems to me im only here to suffer alone with things that arent even that bad compared to others. And i know i shouldnt compare but its really hard not to. I feel like i shouldnt be complaining or even depressed at all but I am and now im so used to having depression im too scared to not be depressed and anxious and paranoid about everything.",0
"everything has changed so drastically in my life recently. I lost my job, my house, my long term relationship and my will to live. I‚Äôm too much of a coward to do anything painful and anything painless seems too difficult. I miss them so much, we were just about to get engaged and then I lost my job and they left. I‚Äôm stuck in this stupid limbo of deep depression every day. Nothing brings me happiness. I don‚Äôt speak to many people. I wish I had a Time Machine or a hitman.

"I (F22) graduated a semester early from a university in America. This wasn‚Äôt an Ivy League university or the league under it, but it was still a private school with a good reputation. I graduated magna cum laude as a strategic communications major. You can probably guess by the name of the major that it is a liberal arts degree and my brother (M28) has told me this is a stupid and easy degree, and has emphasized it is easy to get a good GPA in this major. I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôve worked hard enough because of that sentiment; I don‚Äôt know how to even respond to that because I loved what I learned and I loved going to this school, even if it was expensive. It has always been my dream to go to law school and I applied to schools just as I was graduating. I got a 164 on my LSATs, had my 3.8 gpa, a good personal statement, internships on my resume and other things I felt were note worthy.I got a full ride from 8 schools and got waitlisted from Georgetown law (ranked 14 or at least it was when I applied)    Despite all this, I can‚Äôt help but feeling like a failure. My brother who is in finance tells me being a lawyer is stupid but this was my dream for so long. Even though I have a full ride for school, I feel stupid going in to debt to pay for my housing during this schooling. Am I even worth it. Am I smart enough to go to law school. My brother also told me the school I chose was a stupid choice. I chose the school because it was small and I liked the community it seemed to offer. However, the school is ranked around 60 nationally. I got into other higher ranked schools but I couldn‚Äôt help but choose this one because it was the best financial offer they gave me. I still feel like a moron, and this barely coherent post isn‚Äôt making me feel any better. I feel like I should just quit while I‚Äôm ahead and not go to school bc I‚Äôm not good enough and cut my losses. I wish I was Ivy League level but I‚Äôm not. I wish I was better looking. I wish I was thinner. I just wish I was better in every way. Everyone keeps telling me I should ignore my brother and that I should be proud of myself but I can‚Äôt help but feel like a failure. No matter what I do, no matter how far I might go in life, I think I‚Äôll always feel like I‚Äôm inferior in one way or another. ",0
"The first thing I will say is that this was never supposed to be a surprise. But it was never ‚Äúif‚Äù this would happen, it was always ‚Äúwhen‚Äù.I know the pain that I am going to cause, and trust me it‚Äôs the last thing I‚Äôll ever think about - the pain I inflicted throughout my life and the pain I will cause by doing this. I can‚Äôt even tell you that I tried, because you all know, deep down, that I didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve never tried hard in my entire life. Not even for the people I love the most. Coming to terms with the fact that even though I‚Äôm going to cause absolute devastation and hurt to people that I adore, it isn‚Äôt enough to stay.Maybe that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most sorry for. That despite how much I love you all, it wasn‚Äôt enough, to push me to try - to live. You didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. You tried so fucking hard and were met with tears and excuses.Molly, you‚Äôve been a second mum since we were kids. You constantly had to remind me to show up and do things that should‚Äôve come naturally to me. I mean, who has to be reminded to buy their own mum a birthday card? I could apologise to you, but you‚Äôd never accept it fully, not now I‚Äôm doing this. If I told you I was at this point, you‚Äôd panic and once again try to fix things, and take responsibility for my actions. This isn‚Äôt on you. Nothing should‚Äôve ever relied on you alone. Yet it always was. You were never supposed to bear such a responsibility - to act for both of us. Yet again, it always was. And I was never thankful. But trust me; I am now.Mum, there‚Äôs nothing you could‚Äôve said n c or done to prevent this. No matter how intense your love and care is, this was always on the cards. I never hugged you enough, or tell you how much comfort I felt sitting in the kitchen with you and Molly, just us and the dogs laughing. It was almost quiet in my head. But like i said - since I was a kid I knew this was how it‚Äôd go. And that‚Äôs not down to you or dad or how I was raised. And never think that for a second.Dad, you know me almost too well, and weren‚Äôt afraid to tell me how my behaviours affected your life, and that‚Äôs the only thing I feel grateful for now. You didn‚Äôt push me over the edge, nor did your words change my outcome. The opposite is true - you have been the sole reason I‚Äôve lived each day for 7 months and 6 days. Everyone in our family will find the irony in my death being the only thing I‚Äôve planned in my life. This was always going to be it for me, and I‚Äôm truly sorry that I caused so much hardship. You have Covid right now as I‚Äôm typing this, and still have to take up the slack with housework and shit. What does that say about me and the person I am? I‚Äôm so faulty that killing myself seems like an easier option than change and it‚Äôs been like that since I can remember and that‚Äôs fucking embarrassing. But I think deep down you knew that. And yet you still tried, which says a lot about the good in you. I‚Äôm sorry to those who I didn‚Äôt mention - if I felt I had the time, I would write essays to all of you. But in my heart, the timer‚Äôs going off. I could write for hours to all of you, to every member of my family and the feelings I have towards you. But there‚Äôs no point. I could rattle on about how sorry I am, and how much pain I‚Äôm in. I could go on and on about how broken I am and that I‚Äôve tried my hardest to live a good life for you all but that‚Äôs a lie. Nothing will ever be enough for me. I guess I‚Äôm too lazy to even want to live. And I‚Äôm too stubborn to admit, that I wanted to die in these last few months. Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve subtly ruined my relationships with everyone, subconsciously trying to make it easier for everyone to deal with. But it‚Äôs not going to help. Nothing I say right now, is going to help. Fuck I don‚Äôt even care that if after all of this is over, that I‚Äôm ‚Äúat peace‚Äù - I don‚Äôt even care about that. You should‚Äôve all been enough for me, for anyone else, the vast amount of love I received from my family could‚Äôve carried someone through a thousand lifetimes, except mine. I am sorry, and I do love you all so much. But I wasn‚Äôt supposed to be here for this long, maybe not even at all. You all deserved a better daughter, a better sister, a better granddaughter, and a better niece. I‚Äôm sorry that I couldn‚Äôt live for you. It‚Äôll be okay somehow, someday, maybe. You were all the last thing on my mind, and your love resonates through me. But this is how it was always meant to go - I finally have the esteem to act. I love you.From Ellie x",0

"Im 34 year old. Depression has always been present in my life. This year however I met someone who made it all go away for the first time in over a decade. As time went on they pulled away more and more. While i still tried to hold on.  They treated me like trash while i tried everything to make them happy. All i ever did was care and want to be around them because life made so much sense again. I havent made a real friend in so long that it was amazing to have again. I brought this person into my circle of friends and now they are around to stay. Always present. I feel like im not allowed to come around anymore because i dont want any drama to unfold. All this to say..its killed me inside. I have no hope or anyone to talk too. I feel like everyday is just one bad moment from being my last day. I have no interest in anything. All i do is sleep. Today I slept 16 hours. Im tired of going to friends and family because i feel as though im crying wolf. They tell me advice i listen but it never gets better. I have done therapy, have medications. Done work shops and see medical professionals.  Nothing makes the pain go away.  Why is it so hard to find a genuine friend. ? Or someone who loves you. What im getting at is..Is there even a point to this daily anguish anymore? What do i have to gain from fighting the thoughts of suicide except one more day of pain.  To repeat the cycle again and again. What's the point in anything if it can't be shared with others.  How do you keep going everyday when you feel so alone.? Im hoping someone kind reads this and has something kind to tell me. There must be something that can help save me. ",0

"I‚Äôm 15 and I can‚Äôt even physically explain how much I want something or someone to kill me so I don‚Äôt have to do it myself. When I‚Äôm around people I‚Äôm awkward, weird, ppl think I‚Äôm jus a person who floats around in the background and doesn‚Äôt care abt anything.

I said this to one of the girls I was closer wit a few months back when I was 14 and she was like ‚Äúno way u don‚Äôt care abt anything‚Äù and jus started talking abt herself.Next up what I hate is the fact I even started doing drugs.

"Depression has a funny way of messing with your mind. I can‚Äôt really tell if it creates easy lies or hard truths. The moment you start behaving differently, it‚Äôs like everyone ceases to be around you. I know ‚Äúnegative energy‚Äù can be a pain I the ass but it makes me think. If I was gone, would I even be missed? Put a dent in someone‚Äôs heart or am I just that expendable? I understand life goes on but a little bit of a pause would be nice. Memorable.

"Ever since I was young, most people at some point tend to hate me. It wasn't as bad when I was a kid, definitely not. Probably started noticing it around middle school. Now I'm 21 and it seems like quite literally a good majority of people I meet end up hating, bullying, or being annoyed by me at some point to the point where it affects my daily life and sometimes my health. Especially now, its so bad...  People on the internet especially but also co workers, I have had four co workers in counting now at my job hate my guts to the point they try to get me fired, boss me around, one even got up in my face and started a screaming match in the yard.. one kept telling me lies about the boss, now one is bossing me around and acting like I don't work when I do everything she asks of me (despite her not being my superior..) most people I've made friends with I fell off with terribly, I have a small group of close friends (4 to be exact) but otherwise most people I've been friendly with I fell off with terribly.  The internet is definitely the worst though..it's seriously like I am being targeted, for example I will leave a comment adding onto another post I agree with, and people who don't agree will immediately start arguing with me instead of the OP. People attack, berade, and threaten me very often. Even when I say nothing offensive, just sharing my opinion and people will make personal threats, bully me for my looks or just straight up telling me to STFU... I try to be nice, I am autistic so I have very poor social skills but I do everything I can to be nice and cooperative (sometimes too much so to where I am used by people) I don't judge people, definitely a people pleaser and I'd do just about anything someone I respect asked of me directly. I do like to give advice when I think it could be helpful which a lot of people seem to take offense to and I have noticed a lot of folks get especially Ped off about.. I hate saying no, I am pretty flaky and terrible at communication but it's due to extreme anxiety I can't really control üòï I tend to mirror people as I have a very poor sense of self, so I always treat others the exact same way they treat me.

"I was an addict and got clean and have been on methadone and anxiety meds for 8 years. I put on 150lbs because I just ate all day. Around Covid I decided to really change my life so I lost over a hundred pounds and started tapering all my meds. I got off the depression meds and tapered slowly halfway off of the methadone and clonazepam. No withdrawal or anything because i was doing it really slow microtaper. Also I workout everyday and felt really good and started planning for a normal life when I finish I woke up one day 7months ago and started having weird anxiety out of nowhere and all kinds of body pain, I went to the hospital dozens of times and got brushed off most the time but kept asking for tests.

"When I was younger I was bullied for basically           my entire school life. It was so bad it traumatized me. When I got into college I thought it will be better for me and I wanted to make some more friends because in school I didn't have many friends.

I often get flashbacks of all the times people bullied me and made fun of me. I tried to make friends with some people the best I could but I wasn't really able to connect with most of them because of my social anxiety and people here are also very extroverted. I was able to make friends with some people but overtime they distanced themselves from me, cut themselves off from me once they realised that I am a shy, socially awkward person. Now those very people whom I used to consider my friends at one point laugh at me and make fun of me when they feel I won't notice. People think of me as a joke hardly anyone understands me. I am so tired of being made fun of, I am so tired of people disrespecting me, I am so tired of being treated like I don't matter I can't take it anymore. I only really have a handful of friends left but none of them are that close. As a result I suffer from loneliness and the anxiety that I will end up alone in the future. My self esteem has been absolutely destroyed because of this I don't really feel happy at all, how do I fix this? Most days I hate myself how do I make myself feel better? ",0
I‚Äôm going through a depressive episode and I feel guilty that I have minimal feelings towards anyone or anything right now. My fianc√© is very loving and supportive but it feels like I can‚Äôt connect. I feel (or don‚Äôt feel) the same way towards our puppy right now. Logically I know I care for them but can‚Äôt feel love towards either of them. Is this ‚Äúnormal‚Äù for depression or am I just falling out of love with my fianc√© and caring less about those around me? I don‚Äôt want to feel this way I want to return to feeling love towards them. ,0
"I‚Äôve had depression most of my life (I‚Äôm now 26) but since being pregnant (23w) it‚Äôs intensified. I‚Äôm crying almost daily. My partner is sick of it because I‚Äôm irritable (We have recently moved in our new home out of his mums place) but it‚Äôs only over small things (e.g not letting his dog out to do his business, or being happy around others but hardly wanting to talk to me) I feel like there must be something wrong with me as he‚Äôs avoiding me even on weekends spending long hours golfing, when we spend time with people he‚Äôs happy go lucky then soon as he‚Äôs alone with me he goes quiet I get upset as I think I‚Äôve done something wrong. His mum barely makes conversation with me and it‚Äôs always been that way even when I was living with her for 2 years!! My fianc√©s brothers girlfriend also lived with us and his mum and her could chat for hours!  Everyone loves her too and yet no one makes that effort with me? (She is a lovely girl, I just can‚Äôt help but feel jealous. They all say ‚Äúlove you!‚Äù &amp; ‚Äúmiss you!‚Äù If she‚Äôs off out somewhere, but never to me. I just get a blunt ‚Äúbye‚Äù I‚Äôve been nothing but polite and when living there I used to do a lot of the housework, the other gf didn‚Äôt do anything. Just makes me wonder what she has that I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶)I barely have any friends to talk to so the only person I speak to is my mum, and she lately has had to listen to me cry on the phone asking ‚Äúwhat is wrong with me for everyone to want next to nothing to do with me?‚Äù I‚Äôm getting married in April so my mind is also guilting me about baby weight, it‚Äôs telling me no one likes me and now not even my husband to be likes meI feel my unborn baby girl will just grow up to hate me too. I just don‚Äôt understand what it is about me that makes people repel from me? Am I that miserable to be around even when I‚Äôm trying to hide it? I have social anxiety as well so small things like going to the shops can be quite daunting but I did manage to do that today, but I can‚Äôt even be proud of myself. I feel like I‚Äôve lost who I was. I‚Äôm no longer laughing or cracking jokes like I was pre pregnancy. I don‚Äôt feel beautiful in this pregnant body. ",0

"One of the memories that have stuck with me all my life was my dad cornering himself after criticizing an event for kids with cerebral palsy and saying ""That's what you get when you have kids later in life"", which prompted me to tell him that at least those parents could not only afford healthcare and wellbeing for their kids (disabled or not) but they also took the time to know themselves and prepare as much as possible to be parents and then after realizing his mistake decided to end the conversation with ""I just wanted to have kids""That was around 20 years ago. I was a teenager with a set mind of a childfree life (given the amount of poverty that surrounded me) and with a lot of signs pointing at my latent homosexuality. Now during all this time, lots have happened. Still running the longest depressive state of my life, realizing I'm autistic, contemplating that sexuality is a spectrum and one can like more than one expression at a time. AND STILL I'm stuck in that fucking moment... Imagine knowing that your child is autistic and doing nothing to prepare him for the world he's about to face. Failing your child because your ignorance and homophobia go better with the society you live in. And finally, having kids just ""because you want to""And I'm here, defeated, desperate, wanting to leave but unable to (won't hurt myself unless I know it's for real).  I've been learning a lot about myself but seriously asking myself if it's worth trying anything here? I'm gonna die one way or another. I've become a social pariah no one wants to talk to or help or (my favorite) unwilling to sell anything to. So why improve or care? why even try? Why won't they just let me go in peace? Fuck, I wanna go out of here so badly",0
I'm young. I'm pretty. I'm talented. I have a boyfriend. I have friends. I still want to kill myself. I still feel like the weird girl that no one wanted to talk to in middle school.

I want my best friend back. I want to be normal.,0

"Hi guys,Since I‚Äòve been very young (roughly 10 years old) I have struggled with the thought that there is no meaning in life, classical nihilism. The realisation of this ‚Äûfact‚Äú led to a what I think is a suicidal episode which did not lead to a suicide, luckily. Since then this thought never left me, but it didn‚Äôt led to suicidal thoughts too often. I‚Äôve read a few philosophical ideas about the meaning of life and nihilism, for example Nietzsches life-affirming nihilism. Sadly I am not able to adopt this way of thinking, the ‚Äûfact‚Äú that there is no (general) meaning irritates me most of the time.  Now here is my question: Why am I even bothered by this thought? I don‚Äôt think it is rational, neither itself - if we think about the human as a mammal who instinctively wants to survive - but not in the consequences too. Even if the premise is right I think it shouldn‚Äôt result in a wish to die, because when life has no meaning death doesn‚Äôt have it too, am I right? Which leads to the question, is this just a philosophical nihilism that I can‚Äôt refute or could it be that it is more like a rationalization of the nonexistence of a will to live? I would appreciate if any of you cold give me an answer to that.Annotation 1: I don‚Äôt know if this is in the right subreddit, if it‚Äôs not please tell me and I will delete this post.Annotation 2: I am not diagnosed with depression, I am currently in the process of getting into therapy to get a diagnosis and hopefully an improvement.Annotation 3: If this post should be written in bad or weird language I want to apologise preventive. English is not my first language / I am not a native speaker. Thank you in advance. ",0
"Idk why I‚Äôm posting this here. Probably because I don‚Äôt want to worry my family but I need this out somewhere. I‚Äôm so fucking depressed, I got off my meds a few months ago because they were giving me really horrible heart burn. I thought I would be okay to just experience life. I‚Äôm not. I spend my whole awake time actively convincing my brain that life isn‚Äôt so bad. I don‚Äôt feel like meds are the answer because they never do anything more than numb me completely. I work a job I hate, pay is shit, cost of living is increasing. I can‚Äôt afford to do anything besides work and go home. I‚Äôm a mother, I love my children, and they are the sole reason I‚Äôm still alive. Idk I‚Äôm just tired and scared of myself. An inpatient stay is not an option for me so I have to just keep pushing. But after almost 20 years of constant mental battle I‚Äôm exhausted. I don‚Äôt even have the energy to try and get better anymore. ",0
"To keep things brief, it‚Äôs been a hell of a year, after several difficult years. 2021 - was unemployed, got long covid, getting into debt. Diagnosed with depression and meds. 2022 - started a new job and working with therapy on the long covid and anxiety. 2023 - Start of year started feeling well enough to try coming off meds, stopped Fluoxetine in April. Then the job started going wrong, my boss went AWOL, I took over. Debt reached bad levels. 2024 - moved in with my partner, house needs so much work. (On the upside, the house sale eradicated the debt). Sold house. Big birthday. Then work has went absolutely insane, 12 hour days, and it just feels like one massive thing after another now both in work and at home. I‚Äôm really struggling with anything that isn‚Äôt sitting down watching trash and falling asleep. I‚Äôm getting so angry so quickly over little things, like I‚Äôve stopped being able to cope with any little thing. This triggers the anxiety that although things are good on paper, I‚Äôm not enjoying life. I achieved a lot, but feel nothing. For the life of me I can‚Äôt think - is this a relapse of depression (or maybe I never was really over it when I came off the meds 18 months ago?) Or is it burnout - instead of considering meds, try to get some time off work to rest and start trying to deal with things closer to home? I know there‚Äôs not lots of detail, but what do you guys think? All perspectives welcome. ",0
"I am new to Reddit, didn't really know who, where or what to get this feeling out to. But I've struggled with depression from a early age, I'm not saying this for pitty or sympathy but a little context about me, I grew up really rough mother was struggling with drug addiction father wasn't around in and out of foster homes the whole 9. So I've always had a shattered psyche. And I've never let my mental health get the better of me ask any family member or friend, I've always had a care free happy go lucky attitude about life it was my way to cope with my depression my logic being if I don't care or think about it it will pass and 8 out of 10 times it's always worked for me. Until lately, I'm 28 now have a wife and 2 beautiful kids, with the added weight of being a father and husband I just find myself disassociating away from my family. I find myself not being able to provide for them properly, I don't know if you have kids or whatever but as a man it takes that much more out of me. I do work a full time job, it doesn't pay much at all. I've tried seeking other better paying employment opportunities to no avail with work places still recovering from COVID and the job market crash, I am in poverty. In constant fear of utilities being cut off or even a eviction. Let me tell you as a father its absolutely devastating. And honestly it is doing so much damage on my mental health and my essence as a man. I am living my biggest fear, putting my kids not exactly how I grew up but damn near close to it situation, I feel defeated exhausted and empty. I haven't had any thoughts of suicide but lately I've been thinking about it, maybe my wife will find a better man to care for her and our children, give them opportunities I can only dream of. I have the weight of the world on my shoulders and my legs can no longer carry me out of this hole. Please God save my soul I'm sorry. I can't be a better man father or husband. I've already called my mother in law and apologized that I can't care for her daughter the way she deserves I am trying my best but I feel it's not good enough.",0

"Hi all,Tough times, guys. I'm 47, two kids (one with autism), beautiful and caring wife. Since the end of December, I'm unemployed. I've been battling clinical depression for more than a decade and, now I have no more fuel to keep on going. I have tried different therapies, a shitload of drugs just to keep my head above the water.For the last 18 years I've been working in game industry and it killed all my love for people and will to live. It ended me.I need to provide for my family, pay for my kid medicine, pay the bills... But I can't. Two months ago I was finally diagnosed with severe case of ADHD and ODD. It was too much for me I guess. Knowing that all my life I was battling the wrong enemy, that I could have have totally different life if I only knew... It broke me - a big, athletic guy, crying like a baby.The worst part of it is to keep the everyday mask on - laughing with my son, playing with my daughter on PC, doing dishes,  trying not to scare everyone with my 'running on fumes' attitude.If I had no family, it would be easier to meet the Great End, but I need to crawl through life for them. Friends don't get it (go for a run or smth, I dunno I hear, or 'see the doctor'). Doctors can't help me, they just cycle the drugs; my therapist said that I'm too stubborn to change. I won't go for another therapy, I have no money since I need to support my younger one with his treatment, and the therapists that my insurance covers are just shitty. Well, I guess that's all I wanted to say to you. ",0

I just kind of brushed over it and told him I prefer listening. He then asked me what I like to do for fun. So I told him. I don't know. It's not a big deal, really. I just get self conscious that he thinks I'm weird, or creepy, like so many other people in the past.",0

"I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I keep a journal and whenever I find myself reminiscing on that past and how much happier I used to be, I read entries from that period and realize I wasn't as happy as I remember.Lately I've enjoyed taking long drives in rural areas. Sometimes I even turn off the music. If I see something interesting or stumble on a park, I'll get out and walk around. On the way back, I'll often start spiraling because I'm returning to real life. I've gone through therapists and tried all sorts of things. The only thing that's worked is just being outside, away from everything. I don't know if I'm just too soft or what, but whenever I start thinking about all the normal life challenges I'll have and that you never really get to relax, I start asking myself what the point even is. It baffles me how all adults constantly have challenges in life and yet they still go on. ",0

So i took it like a champ, worked my ass off like a dog, got a house, a good salary, debt-free and enough to live a very comfortable life, (it didn't take long at all btw). Tried to go for it again only to be told that, someone else came in the meantime.

"It was one hell of a journey. I wish you all the best.Hi everyone. I'm just your average guy. This will probably be nothing but mish-mash. I'll get sidetracked writing this down but you should get the general gist of why I'll be heading out first.Missed a few opportunities before I became an adult; and now the path to something I actually wanted to do is now closed. My ideal career did not match my creators'. I did not fight back, I did not resist. I just tried to trick myself into thinking it was what was ultimately good for me. I accepted it.I honestly am not sure. Sure, doing what you want to do as a job may cause you to lose passion. But looking at those who became very successful in the same path, who started much younger than I did, because when I was their age, I was telling myself my creators were right and I should not pursue what I want... I don't know. Maybe they're right. I could have failed, maybe definitely failed. But now I live with regret. Now that path is shut, steel doors permanently locking away that road for good.I've done nothing but rant over and over again to people I was close with. Ranting and being a negative asshole all the time, and we know that's a no-no. I've lost everyone in my life because of this. Remember, ""I'll always be here for you, in case you want to talk"" is not true. They just want to be polite. I should have respected their boundaries. I should have been less annoying. My friends began to see me as a nuisance, and now nobody talks to me anymore. My outer appearance is absolutely hideous. I can't look in the mirror anymore. I can't look people in the eye. I go outside with a face mask and a hat. I'm objectively disgusting. I hate every single part of me, and no, working out is not going to fix shit. You can't slap a fucking bow tie on a steaming hot pile of boar shit and say it doesn't smell bad anymore. I hate people. I hate everyone so much. Stop looking at me. Stop judging me. Stop telling me what I'm doing wrong. Stop feeling inferior to me, stop feeling anything about me when I didn't do anything to any of you fucking bastard cunts. I wish everyone somehow died simultaneously, maybe by a gigantic meteor striking the Earth, killing everyone. That would be great. I'd down a bottle of Jack Daniel's and watch as the rock gets closer and closer. Suppose my life is not a train wreck. Suppose everything flowed exactly how I wanted it to and now I'm living my dream. Would I be happy? Are you sure? I'm not sure. Maybe it could've gone better. But maybe. Maybe nothing changes. Maybe I still feel like shit. Fuck you all. You all try to validate yourselves; think you're better than one another, think you're cool, think you're going to be on top of everyone you know. Get the fuck out of here. Fuck you and fuck your stupid insecurities. You are the worst of the worst. Jesus Christ. Shut the fuck up.I'm so tired",0

"Hi everyone,I am an MSc psychology student at Goldsmiths, University of London \* , and I‚Äôm conducting a study on the relationship between depressive symptoms, self-blaming emotions (shame and guilt) and belief in free will/scientific determinism. The study consists of 3 questionnaires and will take (in total) about **15 to 20 minutes** to complete. Participants will be able to enter a prize draw to win a ¬£100 Eurostar gift voucher \*\*¬† or a ¬£100 Charity Voucher \*\*\* . You must be above the age of 18 to participate.The study includes 8 questions regarding symptoms of depression (e.g. changes in appetite), where you have to select how frequently you‚Äôve felt the symptom in the last 2 weeks (not at all, several days, more than half the days, nearly everyday). The other two questionnaires in the study concern belief in free will and self-blaming emotions.The study does not ask for any personal information, and your responses will be anonymous. You can withdraw your data at any time based on an identifier you provide at the beginning of the study. Entering the prize draw is optional, and the information required for the prize draw will be processed separately.I believe this study will have implications for the development of treatment of depression and other related mood disorders, as our worldview and emotions are deeply tied to our mental well being.The following is the link to the study, if you wish to participate: [~https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_0vOiKs1Rpp46HNI~](https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0vOiKs1Rpp46HNI)Thank you for your time!\* Identity verified by moderators\*\* to use a Eurostar voucher, you must be in Belgium, France, Netherlands, UK or US.\*\*\* Donation to registered charity in England and Wales or Scotland and Northern Ireland.",0

"Hello everyone. I'm newly an adult and the last few months I've felt myself losing the motivation to do practically anything. I used to be able to write and draw and I used to have a spark for improving myself and what I enjoy but now I just feel ... nothing? That sounds so edgy but it's true. I feel apathetic towards my own life and the relationships I've built. I have to actively stop myself from self-sabotaging my relationship with my partner out of a lack of motivation to continue. I still love them, I just don't feel like I have the drive to continue everything. The only things I can make myself do are the things others hold me to. This is gross, and I know it, but I need to be prompted to shower by family just to get the motivation to take care of myself. It's like I've lost all drive to be a human being and it's tearing me up inside. It feels like every emotion I have just gets dulled a little while after feeling it - like if something devastating happens, I'm upset for a while but then I'm numb again. I think I'm repressing things to the point of having no motivation to change my life at all. I don't work. My college offers will be coming out next month but I barely even want to go to college, I'm only going because my parents want me to. I feel like a leech, and I want to stop leeching off my parents but I just don't have the motivation to do ANYTHING to change my situation. Work would make me so miserable, I desperately don't want to work, but that makes me feel like even more of a leech. I haven't told anyone in my life I've been feeling like this. I'm scared if I tell my partner they won't see me the same, and they're who I go to with everything. The worst part is I'm mostly worried about a breakup because it could cause issues in our friend circle that would make things like DND inconvenient, not because I actually want to uphold the relationship. I feel like such a bad person for it. I love them, but I don't think I can process my own emotions enough to actually feel the love anymore. I want to love them like they deserve to be loved, but I can't even love myself. I worry if I left the relationship, they'd hurt themself. I'm worried I would too. God everything is just so complicated, I'm so scared. Fear and apathy is all I feel when I think about my future. I'm tired of feeling so numb and apathetic. I want to *want* to be alive. I want to have the drive to change myself for the better. Why do I feel so useless? Is there anything I can do to help myself? I want to be a better person. I don't want to feel so numb anymore. Please help me. This is the first time I've ever written this dow. I've never said it out loud. This is terrifying. Please be kind. (I've been to school counsellors, who didn't help, and an out of school counsellor who I just couldn't connect with in any way. I can't afford private therapy. The mental health services in my country are bad if not private, so I don't believe it's an option for me. Any other help would be appreciated. Idk if it helps but I'm autistic, possibly have ADHD and I think I'm depressed. Maybe there's something else going on with me .. idk) ",0

I was never like this before the symptoms started occuring one by one. After trying own medicines (3 months), I visited a doctor, preferable a gastroenterologist because it started with stomach constipation, I told him my symptoms, and also I realised I am panicking, being very nervous, almost losing breathe while talking, voice cracks, the doctor pointed me out ""Why you are looked scared?"" I felt terrible embarassment, and also a bad outcome, I noticed there's something wrong, I can't talk like I could do before.. I couldn't express myself as I used to do, I was very happy person with expressive emotions before this.. Later on later on, I kept visiting the same doctor, but he gave suggestions like ""it's s normal IBS, and you can do dieting, walking, etc."" and proceeded with giving me some medicines, it was maybe to reduce gas and increase digestion, lol. It didn't work, kept trying to visit, same result.. changed doctor, told them problems, no result, kept visiting more doctrs, no good result... At this point, I was very fed up.. I thought I will be cured forever, I will regain my mental and physical ability, I could be ok again, have a good guts.. but no, it increased more and more, I realised my mind is no more under control, it got very bad... Terrible thoughts, bad sleep, insomnia, overthinking, over sleeping, weak, fear of conversation, fear of college, very strange body jerks, sudden cramps etc. I felt more depressed, my mind couldnt let me make decisions, I couldn't think, it was like just blank thoughts.. I couldn't focus on studies, I couldn't think for my future... I couldnt talk to my mom and dad normally, they point out that my voice is becoming depressing, and I also look very sad, shocked, terribly depressed. I want help! If you guys what I've been suffering from, I want to live a good life.. it's terrible to be here, I swear.. I can't even go for a job interview, i get terrible shaking and voice crack even thinking of it.. i tried once and twice and I felt embarassed, I was shaking... Some of the tests I got done by doctors:‚Ä¢Urine test (very normal)‚Ä¢Stool test (very normal, but used to see small eggs in stool at the starting age of these symptoms.. i never got to know what was that)‚Ä¢Ultrasound (little 0.4mm stone in kidney + hydro nephrosis + few gas shadows) ‚Ä¢Colonscopy (mild hemmaroids, proctitis)‚Ä¢Blood test (very very very low vitamin B12, D, some liver infection too, doctor said.. and took so much medicines, injections for it, it might have been normal now, I think.. or maybe not, I didn't visit doctor anymore , believing I wouldn't get cured) Symptoms I currently have, and it's severe:‚Ä¢Restless body, restless legs, feel like I want to continuously stretch every body part, but still it doesn't make change)‚Ä¢mild, but continuous pain at any of the joints in body, might be wrist, thigh, chest, neck, ankle, knees.. it keeps.coming, and going like heartbeating ‚Ä¢Very tired, depressed, lazy, unable to think much, unable to focus, very unconfident, nervous, panicking, bad mental state, poor conversation, can't maintain eye contact, I don't go to market due to this fear, I think so much to go.. it's been 4 years. ‚Ä¢Insomnia, on very periodic phases, as soon as I try to sleep the thoughts always are like ""man, it's been 4 years.. you aren't feeling well, you feeling su√≠ci*I, and you are 24 years old now, you have to grab a job, I can't do anything, I dont want to go anywhere... will I have to live forever like this, I can't even talk to my parents normally, they are sad for me, but I myself can't be happy for any reason, just depressed house, very bad vibes giving environment...) ‚Ä¢Very bad restless legs, i have to keep moving shaking my legs while laying or sitting, I felt numbness, weak thigh muscles and leg muscles, making me keep shaking it to feel good, but that doesn't make change either.‚Ä¢Not severe constipation, but unclear stomach, feeling to poop again, gassy stomach, bad taste of foods, not feeling urge to eat much, stomach mostly upsets and causes pain in stomach, occurs immediately next day I eat some street food..‚Ä¢Fatigue, constant fatigue and nauseous while doing and activity, I left gym because of this.. and I never wanted to quit, and it even makes me more angry and agitated irritated that I can no more do things I liked.. ‚Ä¢Always irritated mood, angry, sad, no interest in any hobby or activities, unable to make eye contact, depressed mood.. ‚Ä¢Life not looking comfortable to live.. I always wake up with the first thought ""one more day, same feeling, uncomfortable, unhappy) I realise I become very normal, happy while I'm in dreams, I felt normal I used to be.. but when I wake up, suddenly body starts feeling shrink, and thought of depressed entered in mind just 3 seconds after waking up. ‚Ä¢Body regular feels like fever, little temperature increase, even my body hairs pain sometimes like u feel in fever.. ‚Ä¢Feel too much cold, can't even bathe without shivering, even though it's summer time here.. -------------------Some medicines I remember different doctors prescribed me ‚Ä¢gabatin, gabapentin (to increase gaba receptors)‚Ä¢rifaximin rifatin (for liver maybe)‚Ä¢escitalopram (for depression)‚Ä¢ciplar la 20mgMaybe some milk of magnesia, some medicines, some pills for stomach gas, bloating.. But no result.I feel hopeless, now i will sit back and cry again,... Tests in my eyes.. bye‚Ä¢clonzepam (for bipolar disorder)",0

hi all i dont want to make this a sob story but heres background i guess. i recently moved to a different state because of arguments in my old house. i decided it would be a good idea to move away from the situation because it was getting scary being there. my plan was to move and do college somewhere else but ever since ive moved ive been struggling horribly. ive never been in this type of predicament ever in my life until now. im struggling daily to get a proper meal my fridge is empty and im also struggling to even buy gas. i have asked people on the help subs for help and they all kind of shun me because im requesting help i just dont understand what to do i cant keep living like this my body hurts from the malnourishment sometimes and it affects my thinking really bad. at this point if this continue for longer i dont see my self making it through this and this is not to scare anyone or even my family but i cant do this anymore i cant keep crying and keep begging for money on here i cant keep going in the same loops daily im tired of it all i feel like ive failed everything idec anymore sorry for ranting ,0

"I am currently living with my parents and I have applied to more jobs than I can count (at least 30+) and I havent been getting even rejection letters. Miraculously i stumbled myself into two interviews which should have made me feel a little better about my situation. then my mom comes into my room and screams about how lazy i am and how i hate being told to do chores, and how much i just LOVE to lay around in my messy room and do NOTHING for her. Its like this every day. verbal abuse because she thinks im lazy and just dont want to be in a clean room. every day i try to not off myself and she has the audacity to come and tell me how im lazy and do nothing for her. as a fellow woman, i understand her frustration. as her daughter, i feel nothing but contempt. there are thousands of other ways she could go about asking me to do something as simple as put some dishes away. i have very bad adhd so when i walk past something, my brain doesnt go ""Oh! Dishes in the sink, and theyre mine! Better clean them up right now!"" it just doesnt work that way but her and my father both scream to their hearts content on ""WHEN YOU SEE THINGS LIKE THIS, PICK THEM UP AND PUT THEM AWAY!!!"" and when i try to tell them ""My brain doesnt do that like yours does"" they dont belive me, just like when i tell them ""I sit around all day because im depressed and cant bring myself to do anything more than rot"" they go ""Well you sure get up when your friends want to hang out!"" and refuse to believe that im more than just lazy. i wish i could tell them that those friends are the reason im still living. my dad even told me that i needed to ""change (my) attitude"", ""(I) cant think like that, (I) have to stop thinking like that"", ""(I) have to stop worrying about things all the time"" when i described how depressed i was. he doesnt understand that depression isnt a state people choose to be in, like being in a bad mood. if i dont get out of this house and into my own place i will not make it out of here alive. every day cant be ""you didnt do enough for the house today, stop being so lazy!"" its like a pit of quicksand. im really begging for these interviews to go well so i can move out in the fall. i have money from my grandpa to cover housing but i need income to buy food, pay bills, ect.

"Long story kinda short: was on a low dose benzodiazepine and LOW dose Zoloft for 22 years. Did fairly well. Was motivated, enjoyed many activities but not all. Had some partial erectile dysfunction a couple of years ago and went off the Zoloft (it was only 20mg/day, over that and my nervousness got out of hand and was 24/7). Felt fine for about 8 months off it (still was on the benzo), then I started to notice a blah feeling, flat, things were not as enjoyable. That slowly worsened in the winter until I had a real depressive episode. Tried tryptophan, it was a mixed bag and gave me some autonomic issues and some insomnia. Then tried to get on the zoloft again, and even a low dose was horrible the 2nd time around. Heart issues, postural tachycardia that was bad in the mornings, insomnia worsened, blood pressure went up significantly. So I quit the zoloft again. I tried some different supplements (a slow tapering off on the benzo to this day), and felt fairly good for a couple of months. Now it seems like every time I try a supplement that ""works"" it helps for a month or two and then I'm back to my same flat, unenjoyable state. I sometimes even get brief thoughts of why is life worth living if I can't enjoy it. It seems like I simply cannot appreciate what I have for some reason. It's all there in front of me but I can't enjoy it or be content with it. The supplements that originally helped were 1000mg/day Niacinamide, then 650mg/day Betaine/Trimetylglycine. Now I'm popping 25mg straight Niacin sometimes, and that boosts mood quickly but it's temporary. I don't want to get a tolerance for it and start taking it like 6 times a day, but maybe I'll have to in order to keep my mood at a certain level. On the flip side, I'm 1/2 done tapering off the benzodiazepine and am doing fairly well with that, better than I thought. So basically I have a low mood without prominent anxiety now (used to be the opposite 25 years ago). Any suggestions for someone who doesn't do well at all with SSRI's. ",0

Feel like I'm not meant to be happy... Lonley,0
"I am a fifteen year old girl and this is my first post after lurking for some time now; I really need help with my binge eating.I've been doing this since November 2023, starting off as wanting to lose a few pounds for a nice event, and fast, so I resorted to completely water fasting for days at a time; and stuck to ED twitter to motivate myself (I suspect that's what caused me to be so intense in the first place.. It romanticized starving heavily.)Long story short, I lost the ten pounds in 3 weeks (mostly water weight), then quickly gained back around fifteen in the weeks after the event. I felt so guilty, and fast forward another few months, I kept going in the binge-restrict cycle, but gaining more than I lost.      I either was fainting from now five-day water fasts, or passing out from week-long bingeing until I nearly threw up. Then eating again when I felt the tiniest pang of 'hunger'.Around Febuary, I reach my highest weight I've been in a while, 141 lbs. (I'm 5'4) I feel miserable, and starting the new semester of 9th, I decide to starve again; and it finally works, bringing me down to 135, then quickly to 129.   By 129, my friend tells me the guy (my age) I had a crush on last semester actually likes me, and him and I start talking, quickly going for a date (walk + music) together.     It was so sweet, and innocent, and I felt happier than I did in a long time; plus this was the first time I had ever had someone interested in me, so I was elated; I really, \*really\* liked him.     We even had opened up about our weight issues, he told me about how he had to deal with intensely counting calories and training for his wrestling, and with how he spoke about it (and how he looked; muscular for a boy our age), I could tell he was very disciplined. I (and I regret this, it was too insecure, even for me) told him about my issues and how I thought I looked really fat/chubby, and he looked at me in shock and said something against it (I don't remember), and said he thought I was very pretty. I still have a hard time believing this, I'm relatively 'thick', I guess it's called, but I am very, very ugly when I'm not wearing makeup. I can't even bear to look at myself in the mirror without it. But thankfully, I look around a five or six with it on.     Meanwhile this boy is a solid ten, and has dated other 'ten' girls in our grade, all of whom were skinnier than me (and extremely skinny, actually) and looked perfect with minimal makeup.A few days later, he dumps me. And on Valentines day. He didn't tell me why, said it was 'for the better', and I suspect it may have been that one insecure comment I made (though I was confident for the rest of our conversations), along with how strict his parents were.     Anyways, without this closure, I got into a depressed state again (it never feels bad enough to be called a 'depression'), and ruined all my progress from 127 lbs, by then, to 141. My new highest weight. It was higher than the one I had even started at back in November, 135, and even in Febuary.     The day I saw that weight, something changed, on March 11. I decided, I would start again. To be healthy. Except I was still practically starving myself, just \*willingly\* eating a four-digit amount of calories, then (1100-1150), instead of doing it on a binge. On top of that, I worked out for two hours a day, every day (even on weekends), and did 10k steps at least, and drank 6L of water a day, at least. And I finally made it! I had gotten to 123 lbs. I hadn't been that light since November, when I had starved myself, and gotten to 120.6 lbs. Everything felt good, surprisingly. I was happy, I had been eating good, healthy foods, I had been doing better in school, I had mended my relationships with my friends, and could even look at myself, all of me, in the mirror (even bare faced, I had lost enough face fat to like how I looked there, too!), and appreciate my body.      Until I got the strongest binge urge, on April 27, and caved in.     Tons of chocolate, fruits, bread, spreads, treats, ice cream; I even mixed a cup of flour with sugar and butter, to make my own 'cookie dough', and had it \*again\*, when it wasn't enough. I was so bloated and pained that I think I had gotten sick, just from that, and stayed home for the next few days. Those days, I kept on bingeing. All day, even while I did my school work. I would have the highest calorie things like pecans with honey, cheese; but the worst was the time I even polished off a Kirkland 1kg (I think) tub of peanut butter. Start to finish. Mixed with jams and honey. I was so miserable, but held up, for the last few months. I tried to convince myself that I \*could\* do it, 'bounce back' as they say, but I only kept growing bigger; getting depressed again from the unhealthy food, and even more depressed and stressed about how the guy I had liked now percieved me. I had bet he thought I was the biggest pig ever, especially after I had told him I was going on a cut, all the way back in Febuary, but now was eating so much and always bloated and puffy.     Fast forward again. It's the end of exams, the last day of school. I see my weight is 145 lbs. An all-time high; even worse than in grade 8, when I was a pretty big girl. Now, I completely lost it, went on a 700 calorie 'diet', re-installed Twitter for the EDtwt content to 'trigger' (motivate me). But, I failed pretty soon, and kept trying again until I got sick of it, though I went down to around 135 lbs. Now, I'm balancing 135-140, depending on the day. I still feel so ugly and horrendous. I look in the mirror and all I see is my fat and acne-covered, scar-covered (I relapsed, after two years, in my SH in May, after my first few binges since 123 lbs.) I hate myself, I hate my life, I can't see any good in my life, and I feel like I will never be loved, because of how thick I am, unless it's for something sexual; as all the other girls my age with my body type are getting attention for. I can't watch the animes I love, because I feel like the characters would judge me, in real life. Same goes with my favorite songs, and movies. I can't even read my favorite books as I used to, because I very often enjoy self-inserting, but I know that the characters I admire would all think I am too chubby. All I can do to cope is go on forums like these and eat, eat, eat until I pass out and can dream about a better life, where I'm skinny and someone loves me how I wanted that guy to love me. Thankfully, I did quit twitter, and still haven't re-joined.     I guess this is all just a rambling vent-ish thing. But I desperately need help. I feel like my one chance to get skinny and better was in March, but I messed it up forever by bingeing in April, and ever since. I need better advice than ""drink water, eat veggies, brush teeth"", IT HAS NEVER WORKED. I have tried it, countless times. We can't afford therapy, and my nutritionist doesn't help at all. Whenever I try to explain to her or my family that this binging makes me miserable, they all are just like ""well, it's good you're eating.""     Nobody cares. They keep buying junk. I'm too young to leave, too busy with school-related stuff to get a job to fund an exit, even. I have no one close enough to talk to about this. I have journalled for hours at a time and it's never helped. I feel hopeless.    I just need help. I am at the end of my wits, or however it's said. I am writing this as I just finished a family-sized box of nuts and raisins, the first time in a bit; just another binge in this stupid fucking summer. I was supposed to be 85 lbs by now. Instead, I'm 137 (I can only guess, I'm on vacation).     I feel like my life is over, these eating habits have been ingrained in me for so long.",0

"I'm a 17 years old boy, born in Japan and raised in Brazil. My family including me are awkwardly super inept, misunderstood or missing timing of things to say, pretty much in the Asian family portraits/stereotype. It has been really tough to deal with myself unawareness and unconsciousness facing convos being socially anxious, totally blanking out, shaking my hands or moving too much my body not being able to fully look at the others eyes. I have been founding myself in deplorable situations through my life. Such as in primary school, other kids really enjoyed tricking me or doing wrong things and blaming me for what they had done, making me the one in the Manager's room. Even if I were not involved in that. Or elementary school, in which I had a lot of ""friends"", thus making me feel more comfortable and free, landing me to take bad decisions. Such as when I was playing with a ball alone, a guy just came and kicked the ball far away to make me run for the ball and I simply decided to kick his ass. Ending up with me receiving his knees in my inner pants parts and being blamed by everyone. The guy that harmed me in the down parts wasn't blamed for anything. And In high school where I'm currently in, I was claimed as racist for saying that prejudicing yellow people is also considered racist, everyone including the teacher called me racist for that reason. Because racism is only applied to black people and xenophobia for yellow people. And I didn't know that, but I also wanted to try convincing or explaining why it's also considered racism. By using historical facts that MIGHT reasonate in some way. Continuing in high school, this time I decided to not make friends and isolating myself. I was in a moment of completely change and decided then so. But changing myself by myself was a completely mistake. Not being auto sufficient to self development and getting fulfill overwhelmed by pressure and stress due the course I'm doing, automation. Started to feel insomnia not getting to fall as sleep properly, sleeping only 1 to 4 hours a day, pretty much making me lose control of myself and awareness. Since I am too tired to think or even read properly, I can be totally compared to a drunk if analyzing my capability to think due the preveusly told things.  I have been always trying to explain everythings, always feeling the necessity to write essays explaining and apologising. Or talking non stop about something bad I have said or done and trying to recovering the lost. Perhaps in hope to be understood by the other. And having my apologies overall accepted by the others that I have a affection to. Because I want to be their friends, but they no longer wants to be friends with me.  I always try to point my own mistakes to other people, and it probably give them the impression I'm victumising myself. My mom victumises herself a lot and I don't want to blame her for something I could just not be, I'm still thinking she perhaps influenced me. Being barely my only reference (my dad left me to my mom and I've never met him). People hates when someone starts to point there own mistakes, overthinking and I feel that so have I. Sometimes depending on my ""mood"" I act completely the opposite of everything said before and just so sudden people starts to like me. But who already know me by the main side, regardless refuses to give me a chance or anything. I don't know if it's a diseases, but probably it isn't (I was thinking it could be bipolarity, since my nickname at elementary school was bipolar). I have been trying to improve a way to approach people being completely honest about barely 50% in 10 about anything (around the 4 in 10 cases being truly honest about something) which haven't been working well... Being honest most of the time isn't very attractive for the people. Or being truly honest only in appropriated moments have been working well, but not essentially. I'm probably not skilled enough to do any good improvement. Although, I can develop convos about barely anything, which is sorta contradictory. If I can talk about barely anything how can I not develop it.  It has been roughly 3 years of pain and falling apart. Not being able to make a self statement or being comprehended by anyone. I think my life had not being so hard since I got into primary school. Being sexually harassed by the school's manager at 10 in front of everyone at school, some teachers got mad at the manager. But nothing happened to him. I don't know if everything what I said can form a understandable statement or a completely falacia.  During the pandemic and high school period certainly was the periods which I started feeling more depressed and emotional (I was 13 at the beginning of the pandemic), due to again my family pressure and general changes that the body naturally develops during that period (adolescence). Sometimes I feel like I wanted to hit my head against something or break everything. I'm losing the interests all my interests I had before and not getting new ones. Everyday that passes through it feels worse. I used to go to therapy but I decided to quit due to not making me feel better and it wasn't the truly me there. I just mess up with barely anything I touch I appreciate so much for reading till the very end. I will be probably claimed as a awkward person to be around, as many people say ""red flag"". ",0
"I'm 25 y/o and a couple of weeks ago I failed my nursing licensure test on my first attempt. Now, I know this happens to many people but this made my depression worse than it already was. When I found out, I cried, isolated myself, didn't do any form of hygiene, and just never left my house. I had dark thoughts as well (I did not act on them). Most or all of my classmates passed on the first attempt and I feel alone in not passing on the first time like them. Recently, I went on vacation and came back last week and it was a nice break from my normal routine. But then I looked at the date and noticed today was the day I was supposed to start my job. I just got sad all over again. My roommate be starting today but I won't. I just feel alone in this. I feel worthless and inadequate. Today just serves as a reminder of that because I couldn't pass the test. I know comparison is the thief of joy but I can't help but compare myself to my roommate, my peers, and my friends who are becoming registered nurses, and I am still stuck at the testing stage. I feel like a failure because my family was rooting for me to pass and I gave them confidence I could pass and then I failed.

"I'm in my 30's and since I was 26-27 I started to feel empty. I have always been accomplished in most things I have done, so a lot of people will say ""oh but there's not reason for you to feel like that"", etc. I had a fairly good childhood, supporting family, never been through any out of the ordinary trauma. Studied an engineering degree, I have been sucessful in my jobs, I have been lucky enough to travel the world as one of my passions, learned languages, created meaningful connections with people, you name it. Last year this emptiness started to become even worse and I think I tried to compensate by having excesses: traveling way too much, going out with friends almost everyday, endulging in wine 3-4 times a week, taking for granted my 7yr relationship with my partner (who I love with all my heart). Although I did put plenty of effort into the relationship as well, all of this took a toll in the relationship itself and ended up in a breakup. And since then all that emptiness I was already feeling became a lot lot worse, combined with the sense of loss and grieving. I was already going to therapy and since the breakup I decided to take the process more seriously, started on meds provided by a psychiatrist, group therapy, talking to people around me I considered might be of help. I have tried to take on old hobbies, find new ones and all the typical advise in this situation. But still, that emptiness still there and now I miss my ex like crazy.  And months into therapy, meds and trying everything I can think of, I'm now feeling tired and some days even passively suicidal. I don't have any desire to leave my room or interact with people, just wishing one of these mornings I don't wake up. I feel utterly miserable. I try to keep telling myself that this is temporary and to hold on to the thought of happy moments that will probably never come back. On the few occasions when those passive-suicidal thoughts turn into more active thoughts, the only thing that keeps me from moving forward with those is avoiding my mom such terrible pain.I don't know how to make this emptiness stop and the emotional pain that comes with it.",0

"I am male, 26 yrs old, and I struggled with depression since I started university and during the first one and a half years, I could still differentiate my episodes (without knowing that it was depression). Since early 2020, I could not differentiate the episodes anymore. I guess, it became chronic. I had some not so nice ""frienships"" during my first terms and most of them just used the relationship to get all of the university material from me and...well, I guess I was just ""the student, who can give you this and that when you need it"". During the first three terms, I had clear episodes with  the typical ""healthy periods"" in between, but I was dropped out of those ""friendships"". I am a very emotional person and I guess, it is not easy as a young man. I thought, I found someone, I could relate to. She also made me come to her so that she could cry her eyes out on my shoulder, she walked beside me with her arm in my arm, but when I tried to explain to her, that she always ""spit at me"" with anger, when something upset her, she could not handle that, she told me, that I am ""too emotional for her"" and that was more or less the last thing, that more or less made the depression chronic. I was excluded from our ""trio"" (two girls and me) more or less immidiatly and it came out  I fell....deep into the dark.  I did not know it was depression, but when I finally visited a doctor, in late 2022, because my weight was dangerously low due to my decreased appetite, I was put on Citalopram. That med worked for two to three weeks on the highest dose, but it stopped working since then and I've tried multiple other options since then (Sertraline Venlafaxine, Bupropion, a combination of Venlafaxine and Bupropion, Citalopram once again and I am about to start Duloxetine now).Therapy did not really help me. I could attend a few lectures during the last two terms, but all while going through that with anxiety. I literally want to get out of the lectures all the time. I had many, many conversations with my mother. She tries to understand and so on, but my father and my sister are not understanding. I try all I can, I really am, but they don't get that I am afraid to form new bonds, because of all those ""fake friends"" I found during my first terms. My father and my sister don't get that it is hard for me to form bonds. I don't want to meet my sister's friends, I just don't. I feel like, I can not connect to anybody. ",0

"Been depressed since I started high school at about 11. A few suiceide attempts here and there,(one this year), a looot of unhealthy decisions and mistakes made along the way and a particualrly long black spell that lasted months(beginning late last year) and I finally caved and saw a psychiatrist, at my mother's behest. For context, I'm an international student studying quite far from from home and I'm in my 3rd year now. If it were me, I'd just grit my teeth and bear with it but I guess I didn't want a repeat of my first breakdown which ended in me dropping out and heading home(this was right before Covid).So yeah, partially the only reason I'm doing this is because my school has free counselling/therapy and I know how expensive that stuff can get from what my graduated friends have told me. I'm also sure that this is the first time I've just openly talked with a stranger face-to-face(sober) and just, i don't know, talked about me? Without any masks or pretenses, it's a bit strange but maybe it's like that at first all the time.Mainly w riting this because it's hard to express how negatively I virw it. I feel exposed, I can't sleep, it feels like I'm in crosshairs.

I did have some friends who liked kpop but they sometimes looked down on me and my country. When I confided in them about the struggles, they said I was being too sensitive. It was kind of obvious since I was the only asian but still.. I became paranoid thinking everyone's a racist and cut ties with everyone i knew, even those from my own country.

I hate myself for even thinking at one point that the whole world against me, when I don't. I hate myself even more that some people don't seem to think that way. I'm too quiet, too passive, can't stand up for myself. I hate myself for keeping bottling my feelings and keeping things to myself. I don't know how to act when being comforted and I don't know what to do when comforting someone. I'm a bad daughter for not providing comfort to my mother who obviously just cried. It hurts me that my brother knows that she had always cried ever since dad died and this is the first time I see it.I'm a bad sister for being sa choosy, lazy and spoiled.I'm a bad friend for thinking the worst about my only friends.

"Ever since I moved in to my current residence 7 years ago my roommate has began to display strange behaviors. The displays seemed at first to be a product of mental disability, depression coupled with a form of autism but I've come to the conclusion that there's an aspect of silent envy to this problem. My roommate has told me he has ptsd and for the first two years I lived here he seems to for the most part mind his own space and business and would watch TV in his living room. But slowly over time has developed this strange behavior where he now stays and lurks in his room all day with his door open in silence right across from my room so he can hear everything I'm doing. At first I thought he was just getting some peace and quiet. But then I realized as it became more apparent when he would literally do it consistently for the entire day and night and react to anything I did, if i left the house, had someone over etc. Then he started doing this weird shit where would somehow know whent I go to bed and he would go to bed at the same exact time as me every single night and wake up the same time in the morning. This made me uncomfortable because its suggesting he literally is such a weirdo that he lurks in his room and just listens to what im doing all day. He'll time things perfectly to act like he's doing something like walk into the kitchen at 2 am right I've turned my light off and got on my bed and lurk and stand next to my door in the dark to the point where I've thrown shit at the door and alled him names like wtf are you doing I can hear you fat moron! I've also caught him several times standing in the dark behind his door late at night waiting for me to come out of my room to go to the bathroom. I've called him out on his retarded behaviour and told him he better learn to stop it or I'm going to wind up in prison in day for taking a router router drill to his eardrums. Which isn't me I don't want to and have never hurt anyone but this person has made my life miserable to the point I'm borderline psychotic.its like their entire existence is out of silently lurking envy of my existence. And they are so depressed and retarded they can't understand themselves to help it so there's nothing I can say or do to change it and I think that fat sloth demon knows that shit! So he continues doing what he does lurking and eavesdropping on my business and life making me feel uncomfortable everyday because that's all he can do.

Having graduated a while back I see others' ambitions and plans for future and I can't do the same because thinking about having to live longer and more makes me want to barf.

In my mom's words, for a girl without any talent the only good thing I had was my brain, which I donot believe works anymore.

Every time i look in the mirror, i agree with them. I hate when i talk. I hate when i walk into a room. I hate it all, and i hate the fact that i have to live with myself.

I don't want to kill myself. But i've told myself for years that it's going to get better and it hasn't yet. How much longer do i have to wait? How long until i stop wanting to rip my brain out and stop on it? Why are these questions unanswered?",0
"I‚Äôve (30f) been struggling with depression since at least middle school. Up until this point it‚Äôs not been so severe that I can‚Äôt manage it. I don‚Äôt understand. I have so much going for me. I have a phenomenal husband, I love my dog, I love my house, I think I‚Äôm smart and hard working.But these last few months my depression has gotten the best of me. I can‚Äôt keep up with household tasks. I can‚Äôt make myself get out of bed in the morning. I just want to keep eating. I‚Äôm afraid if I keep descending into this ominous abyss that I‚Äôm going to fumble my job. I don‚Äôt want my husband carrying the burden of my piss poor mental health. I‚Äôm finally considering taking medication for it (again) despite never responding well to any medications I‚Äôve been on before for it. What do I do? How did you beat depression? How can I get out of this funk? I want to enjoy my life and stop feeling this way. It‚Äôs so dark.",0

"I'm so brutally scared of interacting with people. There's been so many times in my life that people have randomly switched up on me I'm genuinely scared of people. There's been so many people in my life that has randomly switched up on me. I don't want to die but I don't want to live here anymore. I have such a warped view of life I don't even know what to think anymore. I seriously think I'm living in hell all I remember is terrible memories. I've been harassed so many times in my life and every single time I've had to just suck it up. I don't care what anyone says anymore this world is evil. We all live in hell we just pass the suffering around too eachother. I'm a devout Christian but I'm having doubts about god. I don't know if he's genuinely as powerful as he's claimed to be. I don't understand how god could ever allow evil to ever exist in the first place, he's god the creator of literally everything how could he ever give us a conscious and soul to live. Did god allow evil to exist because he's insecure and needs us to suffer just to make sure were being genuine with our love? How could I ever reciprocate love back to god when love has never genuinely been reciprocated to me? I genuinely despise my father for the things he's done to me and my mother did indeed raise me but it was never out of love, I was always just a burden to her. she did it out of not wanting to be called a bad mom infront of her friends and family. All she ever did to me was complain that I wasn't like other kids and then when I tried being like ""other kids"" (aka hanging out the very few friends I had by none other than the short side of a miracle) she would always threaten me and tell me that if I didn't behave she would kick me out and make me live with my drug addicted dad disown me etc. I don't know how to show love to anyone I don't know how to even act like a proper human being I've been so isolated my whole life. And I'm just expected by society to be a completely normal functioning human being because hey I was watered and fed as a kid right? Your life couldn't have been that bad, why arent I a hot charismatic multi millionaire oil rig working hunking stud of a hard working man yet huh?

"hello haha i never imagined myself downloading reddit and even posting something here but here I am. Idk how this works. I don't even know if people would notice my post but here's my story (bare with me bcs hindi ako marunong magkwento)Incoming fourth year college na sana ako, but there's this one prof from last sem which really frustrated the whole class and the other section. He's known sa paghihingi ng money in disguise as a donation daw kapalit ng grades.I was on his good side, ako yung minemessage sa mga classes namin last sem and kung may mga tanong siya. One night, during summer break na 'to around 9pm, he asked for my whereabouts and even called na hindi ko sinagot due to uncomfort kasi nga late na. I politely replied parin and then he told me about a class meeting daw sa isang park malayo sa school. The place and time of the meeting is inconvenient sa commuters kasi wala ng mga dorm dahil nga summer break. I forwarded the message on our class gc and I jokingly labeled him ""gagi, pisti, and kalamri"".Someone snitched me and sent my message to him and he threatened to press charges. I kept on asking apology to him but he insists na magkakaso siya and ipapa-expel ako and there's a possibility daw na makareceive ako ng warrant. I was so anxious that I couldn't eat and sleep. I've been harming myself na rin which was my usual coping mechanism  I met him ulit and handed him my personal apology letter kasama ang ilang classmates but then, sa korte na daw ako magpaliwanag. Before ending that meeting, he told me to meet him alone and I did out of so much fear. On that meeting, he asked me to give him 10,000 which he claimed to be the lawyers fee daw na ibinayad niya, if maibalik ko daw yun, he will ask his lawyer to file a motion to wash the case. He doesn't want me to let my parents know about it and not even my closest friends.I am not really good at handing situations and feeling ko, walang solution sa problem ko. I've been wanting to kill myself dahil hindi ko na rin kinakaya yung thoughts ko and the heavy feeling in my chest. Breathing for me is extremely uncomfortable. Sana hindi nalang ako magising. ",0

"So Friday my ex (whom I've lived with for 1.7 months past pur breakup ( because we have a 1 year old) Anyway he woke up at like 12:30 pm and I had been up with our soon since 6:30. So I was like ""I'm gonna go drink my coffee if you could get him (my son) a few drink . He He got mad and said he never just gets a minute to do anything ( he plays a cellphone game that has some event at that time of day. I got pretty upset, I have BPD and I won't lie... It set me off. I just couldn't understand how he thought he deserved more time before helping with his son when I had don it all morning. Well things escalated and at one point he starts screaming about how he just wants to take a shot and I won't let him ahit. He keeps yelling and so do I, he grabs a knife from his dresser and threatens to s/it his wrist if I don't shut up. Honestly I at first said I didn't care of but then I remembered my therapist said if he ever tried that again to just call th cops. So I did. He lost his mind. He scream ok neverind I'll stop, stabbed his metal dresser a few times and hit it with his head.  I stayed on the phone  and spoke to the operator , but Aaron kept yelling at me and saying how I just wouldn't let him shit and the operator tried to tell me to ignore him... But it was hard and I kept replying, because it wasn't as simple as he was trying to make it sound.  The operator ask if there are weapons in the house and I said knives and I guess they decided that meant my ex was armed because when they showed up they got pretty rough with him. They took him to the hospital and I wouldn't let him come back that night. The last thing he said to me was he was going to pass out so he was going to walk downtown. The next day I wanted talk some things through, wouldn't even answer the phone all day... The next day I called the local shelter and found out he was safe and there.  He now seems to be blame me for everything bad that every happen and I lie to my therapist and am manipulating everyone... Or at least that's what his homeless buddies thought he so kindly told me. Theythink I'm insane. May e I am... I just gave up and said he can come back... We have stipulations...  But I just don't care... I'm just a bad person and I don't even wanna be anymore... I wrote a letter to my son just to see how it would feel. I love him so much, but all I do is cause people burden and pain ...bno matter how many pills I take or therapy sessions I attended... I'll always be broken. ",0

"When I was 14 years old, I attempted to take my own life. I was very young and foolish at the time, and I made a careless mistake that I deeply regret to this day. I was going through a rough time in my life. My mother left me, and my father was never really there for me emotionally. But one day, I confided in my school about this because I had no one else to talk to or help me. I thought they would keep this information private, but they didn't. So they sent me to the hospital where I was admitted for a few days. It wasn't the embarrassment of everyone seeing the ambulance arrive at my school, or the feeling of betrayal by my teachers that bothered me. What drives me crazy to this day is my father's reaction. Instead of comforting me when I was at my worst, he screamed at me, called me every name in the book in front of my teachers, and hit me multiple times. Since that moment, I've struggled with trust issues, social anxiety, depression, and a distant relationship with my father. It's hard for me to communicate with people and make friends. I am 24 years old now, and I still think about that moment. It affects me to this day.",0
"I‚Äôve always had nihilistic and rational beliefs and views on life or world in general. It just seemed more logical to me to believe that nothing has to make sense. It just exists, life is not fair or unfair, it‚Äôs just the mind perceiving it. The good and bad do not exist unless one‚Äôs mind perceives it and judges.However since I‚Äôve swallowed the blackpill it has opened a big hole in my soul that it‚Äôs getting progressively worse. Everything is greyish. I cannot see the beauty in life anymore. I‚Äôve lost all the appetite. Been starving for 3 days now. Sleep is the one time I feel good because my mind is too tired to process anything so it‚Äôs like I stop existing for a short amount of time until I wake up with an extreme feeling of sadness and numbness, wishing it was just a dream. But it‚Äôs reality. I realised that I‚Äôm very emotional even though I try to hide and convince myself that I use logic, what I said above on the nihilistic views aren‚Äôt helping anymore. They‚Äôre making me worse. And I believe that hope is the one thing that keeps one alive.A man with no hope is a man dead. It all makes sense. Hope is the only thing that keeps man content. Hope to start a business one day so you can have financial freedom, hope to pursue a college degree to have a career. Hope to improve yourself to feel fulfilled and more attractive. Hope to find someone and have a family, not die alone.It‚Äôs hope, the only thing that keeps humans not go insane like me or other people going through similar experiences. Unless you are a monk of course or a very small percentage of people. I understand and believe that happiness is a state of mind but unfortunately I am just someone with traumas, anxieties and depression, I cannot become a monk or just press a button and become happy. I will always compare myself to other people and feel inferior. This feeling of inferiority and the massive fear of rejection has caused me to isolate myself and feel miserable.My mother tells me to be grateful because you are physically healthy and there‚Äôs people whose days are counting. Sure this is a solid and wise point to view. I never said I am not grateful for my health, but is it really living if now I see everything black and white?  I‚Äôve always had social anxiety and terrible low self esteem ever since puberty hit me, which I haven‚Äôt done anything to help me but ignore, since my mother isn‚Äôt someone who considers mental health important. The terrible social anxiety I‚Äôve had has caused me to be so lonely and introverted that I never approached anyone or talk to someone, which led me to absolute loneliness. I am someone very humble but very anxious to the point I‚Äôve questioned if I‚Äôm autistic or is it really just social anxiety. We‚Äôre human beings. It‚Äôs in our DNA to want to socialize and have people around.Now that I‚Äôve discovered the so called blackpill theory I‚Äôve gotten devastated and absolutely crushed to the point I see no reason in wanting to improve myself and try to approach people. I‚Äôve never been called as unattractive or ugly, instead I may have gotten compliments here and there. I am someone who is very analytical and introspective. I may be awkward sometimes due to my anxiety but once someone gives me a chance to talk and get comfortable I can talk about anything.TL;DR: I am a male in his early twenties who has always been insecure and socially anxious to talk to anyone or approach people with massive fear of rejection, which has now led to total isolation. Recently I have discovered the blackpill theory which states that looks is the most important factor in how people view you and your confidence. So not only was I insecure and shy before, but now I am absolutely crushed since I have to worry about not being a tall handsome model-looking male to go outside and meet people. I want to be social. I want a group of friends, a relationship too. If I was socially anxious to go out and talk to people or find people before,  now I‚Äôm absolutely hopeless and see no point in anything.Any answer and opinion on how can I improve and change my view on the world is appreciated.",0
I wake up every day wanting to end it. I don‚Äôt eat much and I don‚Äôt sleep very well. I just want to die in my sleep at this point.

"My mother keeps having these massive fights with my sister to the point of her threatening to leave the house and never come back or my sister ends up locking herself in her room and I'm always worried she will k!Il herself. I constantly feel guilty as I'm usually in the middle of it all. It feels like I'm having to console my mother over something even if it is her fault. This time I'm particular my mother and sister had a massive fight which ended with my mother throwing my sisters food away. What sucks is that l'm not close to my sister at all, even plan to go non-contact with her once she leaves home. I don't think I'll ever be able to love her and she's always been somewhat mentally abusive to me and my mother.Though my mother has severe anger issues and even though she is going to therapy it feels like I'm the therapist. I also thought I should to mention I go to therapy but I'm not ready to tell her this yet. I'm honestly scared to live at this point. I don't want to constantly be surrounded by this hell. My sister is dangerous and even though she's been offered therapy she won't take it or anything similar on that matter. Thanks for letting me vent to you Reddit as I don't have anyone else to talk to. It severely affects my mental health to the point where I've restricted myself to only allowing myself to cry in front of them once a year. I've also forbidden myself from crying tr anyone else. I have not cried in-front of some. (not even my best friends) for 7 years and my mental health has never been worse. ",0

"I don't get why stories like Stranger Things or IT are so popular because I really can't relate to those characters. It seems like the whole point of those stories is about how great it is to be a typical kid with a close group of friends and it portrays childhood friendship as something you really need growing up, so it feels like gaslighting. I'm autistic and grew up socially isolated, and never even had the bare minimum of what normal kids have growing up. I don't recall ever going to the mall or movies with friends, never had the summer camp experience that you see in so many movies, and never had a birthday party with a bunch of friends to celebrate with. When I graduated high school it didn't seem to mean much and I just went home afterward. It really makes me hate the kids you see in those stories because they seem too idealized and I never met any real kids who were that nice or accepting. I don't find normal kids that relatable because I didn't have much positive interaction with them, and I don't know what it's like to have a group like that who look out for you, so I don't really get the appeal. I'd probably feel differently if I was still a kid or a teenager and still had hope but I think it's too late now. ",0

"I have always been a sad child. My father hit me as a child brutally- Wooden rulers, metal rods, belts.. you name it. I was also sexually abused as a child by multiple people. I was fat-shamed and went to a catholic school where teachers constantly slut-shamed me.Then my parents sent me off to a boarding school and apart from harbouring feelings for a super straight girl, time there was nice. So, about this girl, she would constantly pull me close and push me away. Times when she would be with me the entire day and then disappear without explanation. I would cry and cry and cry and feel helpless.Then I went to university, and started feeling deeply inadequate about everything- my looks, my skills, my personality- everything. The first semester went by like this. Then, the pandemic happened and something In me clicked. I bought a foodscale, a weighing machine and started working out like 5 hours a day. Eating like 500 calories a day. Obviously, I lost weight, but I'd developed an eating disorder by then. All I thought about was my body and I couldn't stand to look in the mirror. Whatever I saw was so distorted, I had zero sense of my own flesh. Now the pandemic was over and I was back to university. Then started a long pattern of people- romantic interests, mostly- abandoning me. They would have sex with me and just.. leave. All of them. My bestfriend was the best human being in my life. He died by suicide. I was the one who found him. I screamed, shouted but no one came to help. Months later, a friend of mine and I just started having feelings for each other. We got into a relationship. I thought finally.. some happiness. But slowly, in the trenches of the relationship, I started feeling very anxious in the relationship. Feelings of deep abandonement. Fear of abandonement. The relationship started to suffer because my ex was also mentally ill, and I guess I was a lot to take in general. After a year of dating, they broke up with me. Thrice. And since then, things just unraveled. I became absolutely dysfunctional. I would drink the whole day and when I couldn't afford, I would have cough syrup. Or anything to keep me drunk/high. I was so anxious going outside my apartment. I saw ex everyday in college. I just couldn't stop going to college because I wouldn't pass without a 75% attendance. But that happened anyway. I left my exams. My degree (2-year Masters degree in clinical psychology) ended in April. I still have to give two exams I skipped, to complete my degree.In between this, I was on heavy Psychiatric drugs. As much as 15 in a day. Pretty sure I was abusing them as well. I am back home now, and no matter how hard I try I am persistently sad. I have been persistently sad all my life. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder.

"13f happens every fucking night i always lay on my couch next to my body pillow and all of a sudden i think about someone that hates me so much to the point they stab me everywhere until i look like someone who was impaled by a million spikes. other times i think about hanging myself while no one gaf about my death thinking it's a joke. there's a lot more intrusive thoughts i think of like burning, getting crushed, drowning, but i mainly think of those 2 i just mentioned. these thoughts are basically the reason i don't sleep. i watch too much yandere simulator gameplays and listen to depressing music which is another reason i don't sleep and although this has nothing 2 do with intrusive thoughts i still added it anyway bc I'm too depressed.

"first off, i know im a bad person. i just need to tell the truth for once, so i can feel like a man.okay so, me and my ex had been dating for 2 years. we both had our flaws, we were young, and eachothers first love. she did things, i did things, but what i did was way worse. in september of 2023 i commited my greatest mistake and sin.she was a special girl, at first she stayed with me and i swore to her i wouldn't do it again. but since then, she got further and further away from me. and i don't blame her for it. we were off and on but on the night of july 25th, she told me she was with someone else. i took it very badly because i still loved her (ironic, i know.) trust me, i know that i deserved for her to do that.i do regret it very much. i apologized to her a million different times, and i would do anything to make it up to her. i would do anything to warn myself, to change the past. i was a really bad boyfriend, but it only took something as tragic to realize that i was a bad boyfriend. i wish i could tell myself to be a better man so i wouldn't lose her.  i feel extremely guilty and depressed. i cry almost every day all day, even though i should not be the one crying. and i cannot take care of myself. when i look in the mirror, i see a boy who could not control himself. i lost the love of my life because i was so fucking stupid. since that night, i have been hung up on alcohol and weed. i also struggle to keep meals down and usually throw up alot. i also cut myself alot, because i feel as though someone as bad as me deserves to feel that pain.on top of it, im very jealous. i wish she was with me, and not him. but i know i shouldn't think that. i wish i didn't feel like this because i know im a bad person for doing this.what im basically asking is, how do i make it up to her? should i wait for her? she said she forgived me, and that she knows that i really would do anything to make up for her, but i feel like shes only saying that so i dont hate myself. the truth is that i do hate myself, and i can hardly look in the mirror.im not sure on how to be a better man. i know that i need to change, for her or for everybody. but im not sure how. i feel as though i will never be better than that boy in september who could not control his own body.i guess this post is open ended. if you want to comment bad things about me, that is fine. if you want to give me advice, that is fine. i need to know how to forgive myself, because i can hardly look in the mirror. i carry a great shame, and i just wish i had a time machine so i can tell myself to be better sooner. how do i make sure she knows that i would do anything to fix us? do i even have a chance of being with her again after what i did?she was my first love, and i still have very strong feelings to her. i know this is all ironic but i really just want to make it up to her one day. im struggling to move on because of my mistake. it feels like i will feel like this forever. im not sure if i could trust myself to date anyone else.thank you for reading this post if you did read all of it. i know im a bad person, but in making this, i hope i can become a better man for her.",0
"(please forgive any mess. I'm doing this on my phone and it's hard to type and fix anything)I'm over 50. Been suicidal since I was 14. Maybe even younger. I have dealt with severe migraines since I can remember. They made me quite crazy. Anyways. I'm currently stuck in a not great situation. But also. Even when I'm not, I can't seem to stay afloat. I have never had it somewhat easy. Life's always been extremely difficult. I just started having lots of health issues that are preventing me from trying to enjoy any semblance of normalcy.  Walks and doing anything that involve being on my feet are a thing of the past. Not that I have the energy to do anything. I haven't slept a decent night in years. I can't work. I can't do anything, and all I want to do is die. The wishing for death so badly has crippled me from getting anything done I feel like I can't move. I have zero will to live. I hate this life and everything in it. I've been in therapy since age 14. I'm currently on my 3rd round of dialectical behavioral therapy courses that are a year each. They have tought me skills to manage the depression supposedly. I can barely tell. I know the skills but I have no will to use them. I get pissed off when I see someone that has no hope and people just say. "" Get help"" What about the people that have had help their whole life. Help doesnt help. It almost makes it worse for a lot of people. I get it tho. Seems the go-to statement for anyone struggling is. ""get therapy"" I wouldn't know what else to say either. As I don't know what helps me feel better when I'm venting.no one can say the right thing so I basically hold it all in so I don't blow a gasket on someone. I've been more suicidal since ive been in 2 sessions of therapy a week. I feel like it takes all my time and energy. The days I have therapy are usually fucked afterwards. The emotional lifting I do in therapy is ridiculous. Anyways. I just don't know where else to turn for help. As nothing seems to. I wish I had the guts and the know how to just fucking end it. But I don't. ",0
"I feel so hopeless all the time and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I constantly feel homesick and a deep painful longing for something or someplace that I can‚Äôt define. I feel like everyone is constantly thinking about how much of a stupid, ugly, antisocial, ungrateful, overdramatic loser I am and I have no idea how to change myself so that I no longer feel that way and even if I did know I wouldn‚Äôt have the mental or emotional capacity to actually do it. I want to better myself so bad but I need to be better first in order to bring myself to actually take steps to do that. I feel like the world is simply horrible and there is some sort of psychological evolutionarily conditioning that has happened to our species over time that makes a majority of us able to not only cope with that, but actually go through life believing the opposite is true, that overall the world is a good place to be. I feel like no one can claim that and be right. Any being with logic would look at our world and wonder why people aren‚Äôt begging to be taken out of their misery. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense. It‚Äôs a horrific hellscape. I genuinely believe that they created the idea of hell so that people could go through life focusing on some terrible hypothetical fate instead of being able to register that there is no need for hypothetical threats like that. Hell is where we are now. The best part about all this is that is I actually have a great life. Compared to all others, my job is simple, my parents still help me financially. And, I don‚Äôt take care of myself or maintain a social life or do anything at all with myself that would register as a blip of activity/effort in life. I literally just sit on my ass. I am still depressed despite having nothing to complain about and the fact that the world is literally on fire and people are suffering some of the most terrible things a person can suffer through and I am still here feeling bad for myself makes me sick and drives me insane and the only logical solution to all of this that I can think of is to just remove myself from the situation. No one needs me sitting around moping and I don‚Äôt need to lead a life that consists of sitting around moping and dwelling on all the reasons why being alive is so depressing. I am quite literally a waste of space but I would be more than happy to give that space up. Everything is so dark and my heart physically hurts all the time like I‚Äôm in mourning or going through some sort of visceral reaction all the time. I‚Äôm trapped",0

"I've had three major episodes in my life, and those are only times I've had romantic feelings for anyone. I always end up falling deeply in love with them. However, when I'm feeling normal, I don't feel any romantic attraction towards anyone. That's weird, right? Shouldn't it be the other way around, where you feel too numb to experience romantic attraction at all during an episode? How the hell does depression even work?!",0
"I‚Äôm not really sure why I think it matters, or what normal is‚Ä¶but I guess I want a sounding board as to how common it is to feel like I do after loss or whether I truly have depression.In March, my grandmother died. She was 103, all I could really do was salute such an achievement because my mother had gone from sharp as tack to severe dementia within 3 months. Three incredibly painful months for her and for our family. My mother died in march, i sat and held her hand while her breaths became less frequent until one was finally her last.I have a six month old baby, and had to do most of the funeral planning as my Dad has just fallen apart (they were together for 56 years) so i coasted through all that in a haze of activity and responsibility.But now, a few months later I feel like I‚Äôve heard people describe depression, and recognise it from my youth when I had no idea what it was.I cannot really sleep, but I cannot get up. I have no interest in anything other than seeing that my Son‚Äôs needs are met. There are tears in my eyes or just behind them at all times. I cannot think straight.I think its a dumb question, but I don‚Äôt know if this is just how grief is? There is a person who was infinitely kind and always believed in me and she‚Äôs gone.

"I‚Äôve never been in a romantic relationship with anyone before and never really had many friends.

I feel as if nobody really even cares for me and with each passing day I become more and more lonely and insecure with myself. I used to be a very happy person, finding joy in a lot of things. Soon after I had graduated from high school, everything just seemed to fall apart. Little to no interest in things I used to be interested in. I don‚Äôt even have much motivation to play games I like or watch shows I enjoy. I‚Äôve tried explaining to my parents about how I‚Äôve been feeling lately and they just laugh and mock me and it genuinely hurts and pisses me off. Whenever I‚Äôm surrounded by people, I fake my emotions and pretend to be happy but nobody truly knows how I feel. I do nothing exciting in my life. All I do is go to work, come home and waste the rest of my day. I want to cry myself to sleep but I can‚Äôt even form tears in my eyes and instead just stare at the wall while I lay in bed and feel completely numb.

The last time I can remember feeling truly happy was probably a freshman in high school. Ever since then, I always have a blank expression, no emotion, no motivation whatsoever. I‚Äôve lost all of my friends due to this. I do, however, have a wonderful fianc√© that I just got engaged to. I also have parents, I work out when I can, I eat relatively healthy, and overall a well adjusted life. But despite all of that, I just can‚Äôt feel happy.

"Since last time that I posted here, I've had some good months. It's been almost a year of therapy now. Sometimes it really puts my life into perspective but other times I feel like I fail to describe just how miserable I feel from time to time. I want to explain to my bf and other close people exactly how I feel when I start feeling hopeless. My depressive episodes have certainly reduced. Yet somedays even the tiniest incident would send me back to my spiral of negative and hopeless thoughts. I feel exhausted, I feel like skipping work. I skip any activity I can. During these times I fear if there will ever come a time when I have the strength to actually stop doing everything and lie in bed all day. It's not ideal but I feel that way a lot. I want to stop feeling stressed about dealing with my loneliness and melancholia. Because it's more difficult to live a normal life, to go to work to earn a living, to get up so that my loved ones aren't as worried. I don't want to be a burden and that makes me suffer even more. Sometimes I feel like my body likes to give up on me and all of this comes from a person with sufficient privilege. ",0

I hate feeling like a burden to my parents, I know they would hate me saying this, but I can't help but feel this way. I do help out a lot watching my sister when they are both at work. So I guess that helps me feel a bit better. I would just like to be able to provide for myself and not have to rely on them both.

"I don‚Äôt want advice about work. Just some reassurance that this depressive episode will pass.Just for context, I was doing really well this last couple of weeks and making some improvements at work that my depression had prevented me from making. My bosses have been understanding. A colleague who means well has a very very harsh style of feedback that triggers what I feel is rejection sensitive disorder in me. Whilst she says she‚Äôs doing what‚Äôs best for me by being blunt with all this might not be, it just makes me feel like shit when she tries to help. I think the reason why others give me feedback in a different way is because that‚Äôs how you should give it instead of being so negative.I am doing therapy and I was trying a new antidepressant which I felt was working until that moment.All that was just for context, but I hope you can see me now why my depressive mood popped up again and triggered feelings of uselessness, worthlessness, and anxiety.

No loving wife, no kids, just an empty life caring for others and working until I drop dead, to be forgotten. I didn't think I what I wanted was unreasonable, SO many of my ancestors had it. But I am invisible to women, and just getting older every year. I never cared about the money, I just wanted to love, and be loved in return. But every single partner I had threw my love in the dirt and walked away. I wanted to build a life, and it turns out, they just wanted to have fun, and keep having fun. I am so very tired. Tired of this nightmare, of all of societies lies, just everything. I yearn for the grave.I spend more and more time now either sleeping in my free time or in a fantasy world with my dream girl, where I am at least loved and cared for.

"Did I screw myself by refusing to take an antidepressant that actually worked? It really did work, but unfortunately I allowed myself to listen to paranoid people who hate antidepressants and quit taking it because of that. I was on Cymbalta and I quit because of ""scary"" potential side effects. I mean it did work but I had one complaint, I had to take it at night because it totally knocked me out (good) but it also made me wake up every single hour throughout the night (bad) but for the first time in my life it was actually easy to wake up early and get out of bed with zero struggle (good) before that I didn't even know that it was possible to have an easy time getting out of bed. Cymbalta worked for me because it gave me a more positive attitude, but I didn't like waking up every single hour at night.The reason why I told my doctor that I didn't want to take it anymore was because I said that it stopped working, and it did, but at this point I can no longer remember what exactly I meant by that. Did the positive attitude go away? Was it hard to get out of bed again? I really don't remember. At one point I tried taking Pristiq but I didn't take it long enough to give it a chance to work. Sometimes I think I want to try Pristiq again, or maybe I should take Cymbalta again, I don't know what I should do.",0

Second time was hard since we had plans to go on a date together, just for her to call it off two days prior..We pretty much have similar interests. And even now i feel chemistry between us that I can only hope will lead to something more someday. Despite her having her heart set on an ex-boyfriend of hers currently. Its just a depressing time for me. Since we hang out a lot. It also didnt help when she got drunk one night and became flirty and playful towards me I dont know..my biggest fear is her getting back together with her ex. Its just a depressing situation all around. I can only be glad that this doesnt prompt me to drink",0

I go into this state of agonizing hopelessness, because I don't know if im going to make it. If something goes wrong later in life, im worried that I won't have the strength to keep going.

Back then, I felt overwhelmed with life sometimes, having to learn to make friends and essentially becoming a person made me so incredibly depressed sometimes. It didn't last for long but goddamn it hit like a freight train. Thoughts of hurting/killing myself or drinking excessively just came and stayed until I shook them off. Maybe that's just life in your 20s, until you build out enough stability to feel better.

"first off, i know im a bad person. i just need to tell the truth for once, so i can feel like a man.okay so, me and my ex had been dating for 2 years. we both had our flaws, we were young, and eachothers first love. she did things, i did things, but what i did was way worse. in september of 2023 i commited my greatest mistake and sin.she was a special girl, at first she stayed with me and i swore to her i wouldn't do it again. but since then, she got further and further away from me. and i don't blame her for it. we were off and on but on the night of july 25th, she told me she was with someone else. i took it very badly because i still loved her (ironic, i know.) trust me, i know that i deserved for her to do that.i do regret it very much. i apologized to her a million different times, and i would do anything to make it up to her. i would do anything to warn myself, to change the past. i was a really bad boyfriend, but it only took something as tragic to realize that i was a bad boyfriend. i wish i could tell myself to be a better man so i wouldn't lose her.i feel extremely guilty and depressed. i cry almost every day all day, even though i should not be the one crying. and i cannot take care of myself. when i look in the mirror, i see a boy who could not control himself. i lost the love of my life because i was so fucking stupid. since that night, i have been hung up on alcohol and weed. i also struggle to keep meals down and usually throw up alot. i also cut myself alot, because i feel as though someone as bad as me deserves to feel that pain.on top of it, im very jealous. i wish she was with me, and not him. but i know i shouldn't think that. i wish i didn't feel like this because i know im a bad person for doing this.what im basically asking is, how do i make it up to her? should i wait for her? she said she forgived me, and that she knows that i really would do anything to make up for her, but i feel like shes only saying that so i dont hate myself. the truth is that i do hate myself, and i can hardly look in the mirror.im not sure on how to be a better man. i know that i need to change, for her or for everybody. but im not sure how. i feel as though i will never be better than that boy in september who could not control his own body.i guess this post is open ended. if you want to comment bad things about me, that is fine. if you want to give me advice, that is fine. i need to know how to forgive myself, because i can hardly look in the mirror. i carry a great shame, and i just wish i had a time machine so i can tell myself to be better sooner. how do i make sure she knows that i would do anything to fix us? do i even have a chance of being with her again after what i did?she was my first love, and i still have very strong feelings to her. i know this is all ironic but i really just want to make it up to her one day. im struggling to move on because of my mistake. it feels like i will feel like this forever. im not sure if i could trust myself to date anyone else.thank you for reading this post if you did read all of it. i know im a bad person, but in making this, i hope i can become a better man for her.edit: i know that people like me who have done terrible things are reasons why you wonderful people are on this sub reddit. i am sorry. i just dont know what to do. i am really lost",0

"31M uni student (B.sc biology major) currently work nights 32hrs/week at a supermarket. Living with my ex and our 2 year old son. We split up after 13 years because we were/are both unhappy, neither can afford to rent on a single income, because it would be over half either of our wages just to live in a small unit.Even if we could find separate places, she wont agree to a week on week off arrangement with our son. And then even if she agreed to that, she's anti-vax and where we live vaccinations required for daycare.     I work nights and she works days, which means I am the daycare during the day until I go to work at night. This leaves very little room to study.I've nearly finished my degree, but we still live in our home town, and it has very few career paths to pursue in my field of study. The plan was to move to a bigger city and get a job, but then everything fell apart.I feel extremely trapped.    I can't date, because I'm a 31 year old single dad living with his ex.  I can't pursue the career I wanted.  I can't live anywhere I want to.As much as I love my son, I ruined my life by having him. My hopes of achieving what I want in life are all gone, I didn't ever want kids, but she convinced me in the end.

"Do you guys wonder how different your lives would be if you were born neurotypical? I wonder all the time. It's always been a struggle, depression at 13 and a ""better late than never"" autism diagnosis at 30. 17 years of this, at least i know why i was always misunderstood. I hate the feeling of being misunderstood, I hate unfairness in general. Don't get me wrong, even as I lament the life I could've lived and mourn for the person I could be but am not, I still realize I'm only 30 and having doctors and diagnoses and meds is better than not. I just want the green light to rest.Not ""eternal slumber"" rest, just the green light to let off my shoulders the years of being misunderstood, the weight that injustices of decades past that still (see prior neurovirgency details for explanation) haunts and clings to me.I know that pain is a teacher. The child touches the hot stove once, if he's smart. I have a problem where I often cannot tell when the pain has stopped being useful to me, so I hang on to it far too long as if there's a final lesson to be learned still. Maybe the last lesson is to take that leap of faith and say ""I've ruminated over this for 3 months, screw it"" and try to convince myself that doing so will not cause the world to implode and my family (who are all extremely loving and supportive) to shun me like some ancient tribe.It's the time that I worry about with mental illness. It takes time out of every day to be mentally ill. I need a longer notice than 1 day usually for a social meeting just to psych myself up. If I have something bad happen that really hurts me emotionally, it could set me back for months. Months that the people who hurt me are out living and moving forward, while I have to remember how to trust people again.I'd like to hear your perspectives, and words of encouragement would be nice if you have them.

"My whole life I've chosen poorly. For the past few years ive been having a long distance text only relationship knowing full well it probably wouldnt materialize into anything real. I ended it recently. I was honest. I don't feel like I will ever financially even be able to visit short term to meet this person. I need something physical. Also for the last few weeks I reconnected with someone I always truly loved. Its been an extreme conflict in my mind. I thought if I ended the long distance relationship I could rekindle this one. We've had serious talks lately and spent alot of time together. As of the last 4 days iI have not heard from them. On top of many other struggles in my life like a shitty work environment and barely being able to pay my bills and defaulting on credit card debt I feel completely useless. I have tried to sell belongings to get ahead of bills to no avail. I've tried looking for a better or equal paying job with no success. I can't afford to take a pay cut. Mathematically it's not possible. Im already struggling. I just want to die. In 2017 I tried but my ex took the gun before i pulled the trigger. Before that I tried other ways but always unsuccessfully. I feel like I have no place in this world and i will always struggle and be alone. And with the world getting worse I dont see a point. I just want to die. I have no one, I am no one and i have nothing of value to add to this world. Other than helping my roommates pay rent i have no purpose for existing. I just want out. Overall this is how i have felt for at least 25 years. I just want out. I dont want to try anymore.",0

"Idk, it just seems like challenging things I have to decide, choose, or address in my life keep happening whenever I'm in my worst mental, health, and physical conditions. Like right now I'm severely sleep deprived. But whenever I'm not severely sleep deprived for a long streak nothing happens. But it's always right after I become sleep deprived or depressed or anxious these big things I need to address and deal with occur. They don't cause me to go into those conditions, I already had them and then the new challenging life thing appears at the worst point. It never seems to happen when I'm in a good condition overall and in a position to handle such challenges.It's just really frustrating and then adds on top of the already difficult condition I'm dealing with. So it's like why? Why the fuck can't these things happen when I'm equipped to handle them, to address them, to approach them in a good and positive way. It fucking sucks, and it's infuriating me, making me want to go absolutely mad. Idk what to do. Maybe just trying to find a way to increase the frequency of when I'm in a good overall condition?

"I don't know what the purpose of life is. Well yeah my parents tell me to get a degree and go to work like any other man should, but I've been thinking of what would I even do with the money?

This summer I got a few friends to hang out with and we've been drinking and ""having fun"". Still in the backround I just think to myself, what for am I doing any of this? I'm poor now because I bought alcohol and sometimes drove my car with friends for long periods of time during the night. That's also one thing that makes me depressed, I'm poor but also don't really want to work for money. I would either drink it all or make dumb decisions with the money. I have been thinking about suicide a lot recently but I'm scared as hell if I don't succeed in the attempt. It's built in human body to fight against the urges of suicide in a way.

"I've been struggling with depression for quite some time now. I'm a man, aged 32. It was especially bad in coronavirus times, when I lost my job and girlfriend. But I somehow got through it, because I had a lot of other things on my mind. But right now, I have a cushy office job. From the outside you'd think everything was ok in my life. I got an ok job, an ok apartment, 2 cars... But it's just the face I put on. I leave the house and I'm in ""automatic"" mode. I do what's required of me and when I'm back home - I unwind. Usually with a glass of whiskey in my hand.Anyway... Today I felt particularly full of negativity. I didn't want to talk to anybody today. I didn't want to see anything outside my house. Even when I talked to my parents... in the back of my mind was a feeling of ""When is this talk going to be over"", but I continued talking with them as if nothing was wrong. Now, I love my parents and I like talking to them.  After we finished talking, I felt intense hatred and anger in me. Really intense, almost like never before. I smashed my fists together as hard as I could, got up and punched the wall until I noticed blood on my right hand. I washed my hands and cleaned the wall and then I cried for about 2 minutes. Not from the pain of hitting the wall, but a sense of being overwhelmed by it all. I don't know.Anyway... this happened about half an hour ago and the feeling of intense anger is gone. I don't feel as sad. I feel neutral and a lot more social. I also served in the military if that matters... Guess I was taught to get a grip and carry on and maybe that helps.  The problem is still there. But it's not as severe at the moment. It's like my little episode was like a relief valve on a high pressure system.I tried getting help twice. First time the lady doctor didn't even hear me out and went on about the typical bullshit, how I wasn't hugged enough as a kid and that's why I was having issues. No! I had a good childhood and my parents were and continue to be supportive and love me.   So I tried a second time. Got an appointment for a psychiatrist. Guy listened to me go on for 20 minutes about my problems and then said I was fine and that's it. I wasn't prescribed any meds, I didn't get any more appointments for therapy. It's like the doctor didn't want to deal with me.  I never tried reaching out for help again. Still soldiering on. Still functioning as an adult. Still trying to fix my mental health. Anyone else had a blitz-mental health crisis that came and went... Please, share your thoughts.",0

"Hey,Sorry,dass ich euch hier zutexte,aber ich muss mir das mal von der Seele schreiben,um einigerma√üen (hoffentlich) mal wieder ein Auge zuzubekommen.Manchmal frage ich mich,sitzen da oben irgendwelche geisteskranken zusammen und denken sich sowas aus? Mein Leben ist wie ein Horrorfilm. Mit 11 Jahren hatte ich eine beste Freundin, Sabrina. Wir waren immer irgendwie zusammen,selbst nach ihrer OP war ich bei ihr. Ja,dann war sie tot. Mit 9!! Das begleitet mich bis heute. Meine Mum ist ein Mensch,der mich noch nie in den Arm genommen hat,geschweige denn gesagt hat,dass sie mich liebt. Wenn ich mal als Kind krank war,war sie mir b√∂se. Und das zeigte sie immer,indem sie mich ignorierte.Einmal 7 Monate am St√ºck kein Wort mit mir geredet. Nicht beachtet. Eiskalt. Und auf Nachfrage nur gesagt: Ist Nix. Dann wieder Schweigen. Meine Mum hatte eine beste Freundin, die an Krebs verstarb. Sie hinterlie√ü eine Tochter, die 7 Jahre j√ºnger als ich ist und bat meine Mutter,sich um die Tochter zu k√ºmmern. Dieses M√§dchen wurde praktisch von meiner Mum adoptiert und siehe da,meine Mutter kann lieben! Nur halt nicht mich. Immerhin bin ich mit 21 Jahren mit meinem ersten Freund zusammengekommen. Die Liebe meines Lebens. Ich zog mit ihm zusammen und wurde Grundschullehrerin,ein langes Studium und hartes Ref. Mit Mobbing. Aber egal,es war geschafft. Wir hatten H√∂hen und Tiefen aber er war mein bester Freund, meine Familie. Ich war mit ihm zusammen aufgewachsen,kannte ihn praktisch mein Leben lang. Wollten heiraten. Dann starb ganz pl√∂tzlich mein Dad. Allein. In seiner Wohnung,in die er gezogen war,nachdem sich meine Eltern getrennt hatten. Anstatt dass die Familie zusammenr√ºckt, machte mich meine Tante (Dads Schwester) f√ºr seinen Tod verantwortlich und pr√ºgelte mich. Sie nahm Oma zu sich und verweigerte mir den Kontakt zu ihr, aus Rache oder so.Ich wollte nichts B√∂ses,nur meine Oma sehen, die auch schon nach mir fragte und mich vermisste. Eines Tages,als ich Blumen zu Dads Grab brachte,entdeckte ich das Grab meiner Oma. Richtig krank. Meine Tante hatte es niemandem gesagt,dass sie gestorben ist. Ich konnte nicht mal zur Beerdigung.Es geht weiter.Gerade in dem Moment,als ich dachte,ich will jetzt meine eigene Familie gr√ºnden, kam es. Ich dachte,ich brech weg. Mein Verlobter machte Schluss. Nach 12 Jahren.Wegen einer anderen Frau.Ich dachte,ich √ºberlebe das hier nicht,wog 42 Kilo. Totaler Tiefpunkt meines Lebens. Alles,aber wirklich alles weg.Bis auf eines: Die Tanzschule.Ging dort dann wieder regelm√§√üiger hin, musste ja irgendwie wieder bei Null anfangen und war dort eigentlich schon seit 2017 Mitglied. Ich lernte dort jemanden kennen und verliebte mich. H√§tte nie gedacht,dass ich das nochmal k√∂nnte.  Ein Jahr lang hielt er mich hin. Spielte hei√ü/kalt. Sagte, er brauche noch Zeit aber will unbedingt eine Beziehung mit mir.Ich erwischte ihn beim Sex mit einer anderen. Ich brach den Kontakt ab und was ist passiert? Genau, er ist jetzt mit einer anderen aus der Tanzschule zusammen. Pl√∂tzlich ist seine Bindungsangst weg! Ich kann euch nicht sagen,wie sehr mir das wehtut, so derma√üen fertig bin ich.Ich werde also gehen m√ºssen,denn angucken kann und will ich mir das nicht.Meine beste Freundin hat mich heute f√ºr ihn und seine Neue versetzt,spielt also jetzt in seinem Team. Ichbin seit 7 verfickten Jahren Mitglied in dieser Tanzschule und werde mich abmelden m√ºssen und wieder da anfangen,wo ich mich bestens auskenne: bei Null und im tiefsten Loch.Achso und zum Thema neuen Mann kennenlernen und Familie gr√ºnden. Ich bin 35 und ein Test beim Gyn hat gezeigt (welch Wunder) dass ich nicht schwanger werden kann.Mein gesamtes Leben ist gepr√§gt von unerwiderter Liebe, pl√∂tzlichem Verlassenwerden und Verlusten.Ich war immer das Aschenputtel, mehr nicht. Ich hasse mein Leben,trotz Therapie und Antidepressiva komme ich mit dem Verarbeiten nicht nach.Ich hasse mein Leben.Danke f√ºrs Zuh√∂ren",0

(29M) after almost 20 years of therapy ive finally come to the conclusion that I'm just not built for this world. Theres no place that wants me or that I feel welcome in. All I do work and sleep for 6 days a week. I've lost all my friends and family due to my work schedule. I thought that after enough time something would change in my life to give me a reason to keep living. Sadly thats just not the case.

I didnt wanna kill myself, but i completely lost my energy to live and i just wanted to not exist, never having to worry about anything anymoreDoes that count as ""suicidal""?

I'm staying at a close relatives place for August, my birthdays in September, I'm going to go to a concert with my friends, something I've been looking forward to for a while is releasing, and school will start again.

"I've been best friends with a girl for a while now. We met as my last relationship came to an end, and while she was dealing with an on and off toxic relationship. We got close very quickly, spending much of our time together, and becoming the person each other could depend on and go to for anything. But I caught feelings because to me she was just everything that I wanted in a partner. She didn't like me in that way, and on top of that she's still dealing with the ex and other guys. I know she loves me, she's shown she does many times, just not romantically. And it didn't help that I had all these people surrounding us telling me 'oh she'll like you eventually, she's just traumatized from all her past relationships and still in love with her ex.' But now, she basically told me she has no interest in me like that whatsoever and that my feelings are making it hard to be friends with me because it makes her feel guilty every time she's with me that she's hurting someone she cares deeply for. I don't want to give up our friendship, I absolutely adore the girl and want her in my life no matter what, but I can't lie and act like I'm not spiraling downward over the idea that I feel like I wasn't good enough.

"TLDR: I need advice on how to tell someone that I want to die, that I feel empty and life is a haze with each day slipping into the next ad nauseum ad mortem. You don't need to read the rest, it's just why I struggle with figuring it out on my ownI have been sitting here, looking at the post screen, my half removed tooth still keeps agonisingly thumping on and on and on, and you know what? I think I like that, I think I feel alive because of that, my head hurts and I feel disorientated from it, but I feel alive. One could argue that this is some weird representation of myself, I am suffering in my head and I won't tell anyone I know, because I fear help. As I write this it is no surprise to me, I have basically convinced myself that suffering is making me alive, I want to die so dearly, to just stop being, the lack of any embrace, if I drank I'd say it was intoxicating like beer or whatever. I just want to spend my life in bed without anyone knowing I was there, I can't sleep because I never felt awake in the first place, I'm going through life like a haze, yer again reminding me of how hard it is to think straight with the rotting nerve endings of my tooth screaming at my like my own thoughts do. Much like the tooth I don't know how much longer I may endure it, I fear I may yank it out instead of talking it out. I have tried to endure for years, I don't know when it began because it felt like it was always there; I never knew a day without it. I am terrified of getting help, I tried therapy before, I basically lied through my unbrushed teeth because I was younger then, my mother was in the room with the therapist so I did not dare say what I truly thought. I remember distinctly when she saw my self harm scars, she threatened to show my younger siblings and my father, shaming me for it. I have contacted suicide and crisis hotlines before, each time they explained how to help, each time I didn't do what they said because it always would end up with someone else finding out, which scared me to no end. Well now I wish to change that, I want to find a way to get help. ",0

So idk why i am at this place but fate put me in a position where i am left feeling bad because my friend's girlfriend did all the bullshit and im the one paying for it by losing my relationship. My girlfriend did nothing wrobg because my friend's gf was the one who started a rukus and screamed at somebody my girlfriend considers as family. What do people expect in return? A soft reply? No.There are more details to that but i feel like i lost my relationship for nothing. I am suffering for somebody else's drama. I feel like killing myself but i also know that its a cowardly act. I just dont know what to do! My brain is articulating so many things and making me think of extremely negative thoughts. Please help.,0

Okay so long story short my husband has been depressed. He has dealt with depression his whole life but it‚Äôs gotten really bad recently. For context we recently moved to Alabama from Utah. His family lives in California. We are currently staying with my parents while our house is being built. We have one more month until it is done. He gets along super well with my family. He works as an accountant and does super well at his job and is up for promotion next year when someone is retiring. We play video games together and it‚Äôs our number one hobby. He said nothing outside of personal relationships are making him happy. He comes home from work and nothing he does makes him happy. I try to get him to play games or watch movies and try to help anyway I can to suggest things we can do outside the house too but he is a natural homebody anyways so doesn‚Äôt want to go out. He said he feels like he‚Äôs not doing enough not making enough money not taking care of himself ect‚Ä¶ he just makes these lists of things that he feels he needs to do better. I try to listen and tell him that no one else thinks this and he is putting this pressure on himself. He really is amazing and I‚Äôm trying to help him see that. He keeps insisting that he isn‚Äôt putting pressure on himself and he is just depressed. Normally when he gets in a funk the next day after some food and sleep he feels better. But this has been going on for weeks. I try to keep reassuring him he is doing enough and I truly love him and think he is the best man. I‚Äôm just not sure what to do or what can help. Any advice is welcomed and appreciated ,0

"I have been feeling very depressed. I feel a lot of guilt, fatigue and overall very blank. I don't feel like I want to do anything.For context, I stay in a hostel, thousands of kilometres from home. I was diagnosed with severe depression 2.5 yrs back. Since then it has been a downhill. I get physical symptoms too, GERD and random fevers and body aches. I have tried medications for very close to 2 yrs. I was into therapy for close to 1.5 yrs. The thing which bothers me is the guilt. I get guilty in telling my parents that I'm not well. I get guilty in talking to professionals despite knowing this is literally their job. This is the reason why I left therapy too. I feel guilty in telling anybody here in hostel that I won't be able to help them in doing a particular task or going to college on certain days. I feel guilty just for existing. I even feel like I would be better off dead because everything I do brings with it a daunting amount of guilt. I hate it but it has been stuck to me with a permanent glue I guess. Whom do I talk to?

"I‚Äôve been dealing with depression and anxiety for most of my life (25 m) and I don‚Äôt know how being happy or satisfied for any real length of time feels.

I wish I was someone else so bad, at one point in time I thought I might be okay with who I am but I had the inevitable realization that I just dont fucking like myself.

" I think I have never been truly happy because of my parents, they have never treated me well (the only memories I have with them is when mom called me an animal because my brother got hurt &amp; dad tells me every time how dumb I am and that ‚ÄúI should respect my brother‚Äù but respect what exactly?

I tried everything I could, being a top student, being respectful, pleasing them but nothing. That little pice of shit is still their favourite.

"Hi, I'm a female(18) who lives with her parent in India. For context :[https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/8NndBDukXw](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/8NndBDukXw)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/vLYpfuAy5I](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/vLYpfuAy5I)I'm sorry, but you won't be able to understand much of this post without the context. So this happened two days ago/a day after my last post.I woke up at 11 am and my parents were talking about how my aunt had called my mom in the morning asking about my bank account details( implying that she'd help finance my career).  I thought it was weird how last night my aunt/uncles/cousins had seriously stated how much this offer should not be known by my parents so that they don't influence my decision and today my aunt just offered it to my mom. My parents were initially against the Idea and didn't wanna accept help but then I tried to convince them how it would actually be beneficial for me for now and they could just pay my relatives back when they received their money. They agreed after a long conversation. My mom then called my aunt to accept the offer but only for one semester so that they could pay my relatives as soon as they could and my aunt was okay with that. I got a group call from my cousins at night and they asked why I couldn't do the only thing that they had asked of me which was to not tell my parents about the offer. I told them that I only discussed this topic with my parents because my aunt had already told my mom about it. My cousins then asked my aunt while still on call and she fully denied ever mentioning financial support to my mom. My cousins then just lectured me the entire call about how I lied to the people who were willing to help my career. I kept denying it but I don't think they believed me. I cried and then pretended like nothing happened to my parents as I don't think they would've appreciated me telling my parents about anything related to the offer.Apparently, after the call about my mom accepting the offer by my relatives with my aunt, my aunt told my cousins and uncles that I had told them everything about the conversation that they had with me, which is why my cousins had called me at night.  I then woke up the next morning to my mom showing me a message that my aunt sent to her just now. It said that I should pursue a completely different career path as it could pay more( implying that they revoked the financial support offer). I opened my phone and she wrote the same thing to me. I just went to the bathroom and had a breakdown like always and came back.  I texted my cousin about it in the calmest way and he just said that my aunt/uncles/cousins just aren't sure they can help anymore as there is a risk that something like this could happen in the future as well and my relatives also have limited finances with their own families. I said that I could never give them the guarantee that something like this won't happen in the future as I don't control the finances, my parents do, and can only make sure to remind them. I also asked if they still thought that I had lied and he said that He didn't. I said it was okay and I'm tired of talking about my career for today at the end.  I just have one question, shouldn't my cousins/aunts/relatives at least be sure that they can or cannot finance me before offering me this serious opportunity? I was ready to lie to my parents for the sake of my career for these two days but still got accused of lying and had that opportunity revoked.  I feel like it was a prank at the most wrong time lol. I haven't picked up any of the calls from my friends in that college because I don't have a good update nor am i gonna be able to talk to normal when my life is declining. They must think that I've become an asshole now.   I had such a big headache that day from all the crying that I had to take a paracetamol and I just didn't wanna talk about my future for the day. At night, my mom started to talk to my aunt initially for work-related purposes which shifted to them talking about how it's annoying that I won't tell them about my conversations with my aunt/cousins/uncles. I couldn't keep it in anymore so I walked out crying to the bathroom. My mom kept talking to my aunt even after I ran. I came back after an hour and they kept pressing me about the conversations that I had to confess and my parents felt sorry for me.It's already SO hard receiving messages from all the club/college messages where My friends discuss what they're gonna do tomorrow. Posts of everyone enjoying college on social media. I wanna break my phone. It feels like everyone is moving forward and everything in my life is moving back except my age. I'll turn 19 this year.  Rewatching old shows is the only way of detaching myself from reality so I won't cry every second. It gets even worse lol because my mom keeps talking about my relatives in a bad way but I just don't wanna hear their names anymore, sorry. So now my mom thinks I'm rude, my friends think I'm an asshole and my relatives think I'm a liar.  Life feels like a tragic tale that no one will remember. That's why I'm writing this. Maybe one day someone will discover my phone and look at this (delulu). I think it deserves a cry :)Is there Anything I can do?",0
It‚Äôs just a cycle round and round. I have failed again ,0
"My life fucking sucks, and it has for the past two years now. During the final week of 2021, I left an emotionally abusive relationship and ended up with Covid. During that time, I developed painful open diabetic ulcers atop both of my feet, which took 10 months to clear. November 2022, I moved out of a volatile household situation (alcoholic roommate), and moved in with a nearby co-worker/friend. Two weeks later, I was rushed to the ER and had to have emergency surgery due to a kidney &amp; bladder infection. Between 12/2022 and 7/2023, this resulted in 10 additional hospitalizations - during which, I had 5 additional surgeries. I lost my job July 2023, after 16+ years of loyal service. The kidney/bladder infections cleared, though I am left with a catheter sticking through my gut.I had to fight for Unemployment, which went to a hearing that I ultimately won. My landlord decided not to renew my lease so they could sell the house. In October 2023, I was forced to move in with my emotionally abusive mother, which is where I have been stuck since. I've put countless time &amp; energy into searching for work, but can't seem to land a single interview despite being told I have an incredible resume. I am stuck, and nothing I do brings me any closer toward improving my life. I've had to go on Medicaid, EBT and general assistance (through my township) - and I HATE it! I'm used to being there for others, helping them and making their lives easier - now I'm in a position where I can't do a damn thing, and I'm just being shit on by everyone around me.I'm not suicidal, and I cannot deny the presence of the loved ones who are in my life. All I need is a job and my life can start improving again, but the rejection of people thinking I'm not good enough is disturbing.",0

"So on January I have opened a business, and I have decided to partner with my best friend as we complete each other in terms of business. We were driving a motorcycle, and we crashed. This night, I was traumatized as he almost lost his life,his  teeth has fell off, nose is severed, lips is splitted, and skull fractures. I have resumed the business on my own, and I fixed the bike as we shared it. Few months later he is better, and he started going to the gym and hangong out with his friends, and I am handling the business trying to make it reach the takeoff stage. But I failed doing it on my own. So I told him, now you‚Äôre better, you should be in charge because there is so much that I don‚Äôt understand, he said I willing to close it.

Sacrificing my social life so I can take it somewhere else. All the money I have lost, and All what I saw in terms of stress and anxiety. It turned into depression. I don‚Äôt know from where to start and where to end it. But I lost money, business, friends, and a relationship as I broke up with my GF when the accident happened as my life turned chaotic in one night. I am still collecting the pieces, and I hope for an upcoming trend. But I feel nothing but confusion and a void. I don‚Äôt know why I am ranting here, but maybe someone has an intresting pov and perspective, that might aid. ",0
"I'm gonna be brutally honest here, so please don't be mean. Everyday is the same for me, I wake up and I listen to music while having my morning smoke session of meth (which doesn't even help anymore but I'm afraid of the withdrawal because it has fentanyl in it) and then I proceed to listen to music all day long as some kind of form of escapism. I've been doing this whole music escapism thing for a very long time, it feels like I'll never do anything else. And I'm extremely socially isolated, I've pretty much given up on finding friends as an adult and those I did know either never lasted very long or they left me in the end and never came back. And my mind feels SO empty, well except for the ruminating thoughts that my life is over for some reason which enables me to write this. But any other thoughts? It doesn't even happen because I feel so hopeless. My mind actually becomes so blank that I have trouble with conversations for the most part. And I don't feel like I feel anything either. I do have schizophrenia along with depression, and I wonder how much that plays a part. My therapist isn't even helpful, so I'm not sure how far I'll get figuring any of this out. And neither have the therapists before him been helpful. I feel so stuck, I hate this. And apparently I'm not allowed to take SSRIs because of my schizophrenia! So, I guess I'm screwed in a sense. I don't know. ",0

"it‚Äôs not that no one loves me or wants me but everyone around me doesn‚Äôt take me seriously.  i‚Äôm a 17 year old who has autism and i am actually just comedic relief for everyone, my entire life. i feel like i‚Äôm a failing actor and every time i mess up my lines and don‚Äôt behave ""normally"" everyone just looks at me in disgust. i feel like i‚Äôm wearing a skin suit of a human]. if i express any sort of sad emotion no one takes me seriously. i feel like a self aware dog in my house. i‚Äôm constantly babied and not taken seriously and my symptoms are getting so much worse that even the one time in my life i mentioned of s*icide to my mom she told me to stop being dramatic. maybe when my frontal lobe is done i‚Äôll be able to handle it but no one in my house or in my life really knows how i truly have felt about living. i stopped expressing it because it was met with laughter even as a child. hey yk they always say it gets better, i do believe that but no one ever tells me how to be patient until then. please help i want to have a future but my present is already so painful",0

Back then I wanted to ask for help when my mental health goes downhill bcs they support mental health matters but now? I just don't want to tell anyone or even show that I'm not ok because someone told me in the past that they've got so drained with someone who have depression and anxiety around them.Like I get it they have problems of their own so why would I even bother the people I love if they'll feel like I'm just another burden for them.The sad part is if they need someone to talk I'm always on ears and I do my best to make time for them bcs I don't want anyone to feel the same way I feel when I need someone and I can't even ask them for company.I don't want to bother anyone anymore and the last thing I ever want is for them to be exhausted thinking of me because I'm struggling to keep myself away from dying.,0
My parents still believe in me but I don‚Äôt think they know how bad it is for me. They still invite me to things and try to motivate and encourage me to go outside but I can see the toll it‚Äôs taken especially on my mom. When I‚Äôm away at college she has to deal with me complaining about my roommates and being miserable 24/7 and then when I come back to live with her she has to deal with my irritable lazy ass nonstop. We just talked and I literally started crying when she brought up the topic of me getting a job. It also doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm 23 and this is the age when I should be looking to live on my own and becoming more independent from my parents. Instead they‚Äôre my only friends and they have to deal with a daughter who has no motivation or aspiration to even get out of bed in the morning ,0
"I feel like I'm slowly start to be tired of myself again, and with school coming soon it's probably going to be worse. I hate living not just because I get to be alone but I just feel like burden. I'm 16 and never found love yet, feel disconnected from my friends and parents, and just sits on my ass all day. I do take walks, workout,do chores for a dopamine boost but I'm afraid it ain't gonna cut it like it usually does. I had gone through depression before. Feel worthless and a disgusting corpse that is a waste of everyone's time to talk to. I've gone to. Mental hospital beforehand but I don't wanna go again because of the bill alone. And I don't wanna burden someone with my emotions. It feels selfish overall, I don't want to commit but everyday feels like drag. And I have to put on a mask every time. Any advice?",0
"I'm just tired. I can make giant strides in improving, I can go almost a week without making my thighs look like an aspen tree, and then shit (usually relating to extremely close friends nearly killing themselves) fucks me up and throws me back down at rock bottom. The more this happens, the more I just want to give up, because it always ends the same way, and destroys me over and over and over and over and over and fucking over again. Just numb at this point, and genuinely scared as to who'll get fucked up next. I'd be dead if not for my friends, but two of my closest are also two of the most suicidal friends I have. One of them nearly killed themselves just yesterday, which is the most recent back-to-the-bottom part of the cycle.I can't fucking do this shit, man. Just can't. Nothing in my life is in my control anymore and I just give up trying to reign it in--every time I do, life always reminds me that I can't get out of this fucking hell-hole, no matter how hard I try.Not helped that I'm a trans, neurodivergent, and depressed lad in Utah. I think I'm overdue for my death via suicide by a long-shot. Hell, I nearly convinced myself to kick the bucket last night, and I've been generally numb since then (not helped by the fact I doubtless scarred myself last night too, lost at least 3x more blood from s/h that day than I had in a literal month or two. I don't cut deep enough to make those leaf-shaped scars--I wish I did, though, honestly--so don't worry about me in that regard. Preferrably don't worry about me whatsoever).I ain't worried I'll kill myself soon, I want to see autumn, but I also don't want to put more weight on my friends' already crushed shoulders, so I don't *think* I'll die soon (unless one of them dies). Don't worry about me in that regard, either.Apologies to the mods if this is a Certified Bad Post, I can edit a few things if ye need me to.",0
"thought I was over the phase‚Ä¶ just like counting the years of sobriety, had this mechanism where I count the years of timeline that I was away from seeing a therapist, dropping deep into the rabbit hole of depression or even cutting. this week haven‚Äôt been my best. some comments at work made me wonder the workability or how long I‚Äôll have the job, not that it actually matters but yeah. Then comes family issues, which has driven me to the edge. With that took the decision to spend time at a family friend‚Äôs place, which is like my safe space. Had good time until I messed up somehow. Tbh I don‚Äôt know where I messed up, and it had driven my thoughts to think to the worst case scenario. I‚Äôm afraid of burning bridges‚Ä¶ these fam they are the main reason that kept me grounded and away from any collapse. And now I fucked up‚Ä¶ Open up to a close friend, I feel like my existence is just burdening everyone. I would rather be there and support them than me burdening them.

"So im 25, live with my mother currently, have basically no friends that i talk with daily, the friends i do have i have not talked to in years. I have no job, even though i finished university 6 months ago and got a degree in marketing. I cant find a job for whatever reason no matter how hard i try. I got no girlfriend either, and i have the biggest anxiety for everything, but i have not been to a doctor to get anxiety meds prescribed.

So this girl commented to my post where I was asking for advice about self harm and she told me she wont help anyone to hurt themselves and that felt really nice. So I teksted her... later i found out she was over ten years older than me and it crushed me... cus I thought i finally found the one I could be with. She was perfect but she is to old. So I just said sorry and tried to leave cus i dint want to make her to look like a pedo ( im underage ) even though she didn't do anything wrong she might have felt so. when I was saying sorry she was asking why I'm saying that and I just kept saying sorry and eventually she let me leave the conversation. i feel bad and I feel like I have done wrong.i won't tell her name/account cus I respect her privacy ,0

"I'm going to be 25 tomorrow, and right now I can't find any meaning in my life. Nor do I see any future ahead of me.I'm gay, but I've never been in a relationship. Nobody knows ‚Äúofficially‚Äù, except my parents, who pressure and manipulate me to hide the situation.I went bald when I was 21/22 and it completely destroyed my self-esteem. I'm afraid to expose myself socially. It makes me nervous to go out in the street. When I look in the mirror, I explode with anger and sadness and start crying.In general, I'm small, short, pale and unattractive. I had a failed hair transplant, which makes me look rather odd. When I see boys my age, on the street, social networks, etc., so much more attractive than me, with such ‚Äúnormal‚Äù looks and hair, it makes me so sad that I'm not like that... I feel like I'll never find anyone. And even if I do, I live in a very homophobic environment, and all my (very few) friends are also homophobic.I feel so sad and alone. And I don't see how my life can change in the future. I'll never have a family or children. I deeply hate my job,  which takes up all my time and all my life. I hate all the moments that have passed from my life. I feel like I've completely wasted it, to little fault of mine.Nothing gives me pleasure. No hobbies, nothing. I know I've been depressed for years. But I don't see any reason to see a professional. They're not going to change my appearance or change anything that ails me.

"TW: Self-h*rm, su*cidal thoughts, su*cide attempt‚ÄºÔ∏èLong read but please bare with me, the storytelling is messy sorry I'm writing this while trying to hold my tears‚ÄºÔ∏èI don't think I can handle this anymore. In my 18 years of living, I can handle any more torture and pain. I am f*cking done living. I f*cking hate my family, especially my dad. I hate my mom for tolerating what my dad does because ""discipline"" and because of ""religion."" I hate my younger brother for being a toxic male like my dad. And I especially hate my dad because of all the physical, mental, emotional, religious trauma, and baggage that he gave me. I don't think I'll last until my next birthday. I've been having su*cide thoughts again and recently I've been drinking 2-3 pills of whatever medication I can find. I f*cking hate living.It all started before I was born, my father is the carrier of the poison that is now flowing in my veins. He was almost 30, my mom is 21 and just graduated college. She got pregnant when she was 21 so based on that info, I think my dad was pursuing my mom since she was 19 or 20. When my mom got pregnant, her whole world broke and she isolated herself until her birth. She had abortion thoughts and I wish she did abort me, maybe then she would be happy and living her dream. I broke her dreams, I am the cause of it all. Thankfully her family accepted her and my dad showed up at my mom's house when I was around 2. I wish he didn't, maybe my life would've been completely different. Him and my mom got married and the rest was history. History of abuse that is. My earliest memory of being physically abused was when I was around 3 or 4. Haha ain't it funny, the very first memory I am conscious about is abuse. I vividly remember me crying near the doorway outside and my mom packing our things. Idk what happened then because I wasn't conscious enough. Then from then I'd get beat up whenever I make a mistake. Whether small or big, I was smacked with what my father can grab and he would hit me where the weapon would land. I can't even remember the rest of my childhood haha. Idk man. The physical abuse got worse as I grow up. I get compared to kids that are smarter than me, he's the one to do so yet he graduated with low grades. The peak of physical abuse was around 10-14. I can't remember much haha, sorry. He only stopped when I was 16 but he moved to mental and emotional abuse, no wait he didn't move he just amplified it a ton. Honestly I think this is the age I started to be reserved and more quiet, I also space out a lot and my memory went sh*t. I oversex*alize myself and I hate it. He didn't s*xually abuse me tho, I think it's because I think I deserve to be punished, to be beaten, even to be f*ckin killed. I had my very first s*icide attempt when I was around 14. I tried hanging myself, the rope snapped. I tried it 2 more times and the last time, I think it almost worked but one of our neighbor who is around my age saw me and got me down. From then on I think I got addicted of taking meds. I would take any meds I find and pop a pill or two(sometimes 3) haha. And now I'm 18, I'm starting to feel the effect. I swear something is wrong with me idk what tho haha but it's fine there are way bigger problems in the world than what am feeling. I guess this is also one of the reason why I am a big empath despite not feeling emotion other than constantly hating myself and my dad. I am feeling even more pressure now that I am gonna go in a university that the tuition is super not cheap and I need to maintain my scholarship to study there. I am not smart, never have been. It doesn't help too that my univ is just across where my whole family is living so I'll be living with them and attending the ""religion"" that also destroyed my mental health. Idk what to do man. I just wanna live my life. I'm thinking of ending it all before school starts. Idk anymore. It's either i die or my dad dies. Idk If I can plan a m*rder on him so I'll probably just kms. Hahaha sorry for being pathetic and acting like a pick me. Idk wjat to do. Everyday I hate myself and I drown myself with games, videos, p*rn, or anything just anything to feel something. I don't c*t myself because I feel like it's super messy and it'll be obvious I'm harming myself. I wanna f*cking die man, idk what to do anymore. I'm drowning and I'm too afraid to ask my friends for help because like an anchor, I might bring them down too and be a burden to them. Haha idk anymore If you're still reading, thank you. I'll delete this post in a few days or so. And I'll deact my reddit. Idk what to do anymore, probably overd*se myself hahaha ",0

"I always tried and I always kept failing. I had dreams, and i tried to make them come true but no matter what i did it didn't had any affect or it only made things worse. I've come to the realisation that i'll never be completely normal. I first thought about killing myself and went to a mental hospital when i was 10. My mom abuses me mentally, i'm not saying she is a bad person, i trully love her, but she've got her problems. My older sister is autistic and she scratches me whenever i upset her (she scratched me because i fell asleep while listening to music on my laptop, and she told me that the light from my laptop anoyed her. She was getting mad when i was clicking my laptop mouse while playing games or smth so i'm not doing that anymore) so now i have scars on my face. My parents are divorced, and she unfortunetly lives with my dad so i have to live with her, since i'd rather live with her than with my mom. I also have issues with food, and its the same thing. I've tried everything and i just can't anymore. Maybe i didn't tried hard enough. Maybe i should've pushed myself harder. Idk. I'm really tired. If anyone's interested i wrote more about this in my recent posts, especially my first. I really need some help. i've got a therapist and she's great, but every time i have an appointment with her (which is once in two weeks) i just can't speak. I'ts like i'm scared of trying to get better. I'm scared of trying to get better because i know that if i fail (and i most likely will) it wil hurt really bad. But i'm willing to give my life one last chance. I really need help. I don't want to kill myself, I'm 14, i know i'm young and i still can get better. Maybe i didn't tried hard enough last time or i gave up too soon. Probably both of those things. I don't know how i will conquer binge eating but i will try. I heard that as long as you're breathing  there is a way or smth like that. If that's true i'm willing to try, but please help me. I really don't want to lose another time, but i know that if I try i might succeed. I just need some support and advice. How do i find strenght and willpower to do this all? I'm super weak, and I honestly just can't believe that it will work. I try to believe in that but i never suceed so why should i succeed now? I'm really scared. Some part of me is saying that i should give up. I should give up and just kill myself, that would be easier. I just hope i'm not making a mistake by trying.",0

"I'm 36. I have never been in a LTR and haven't been on a date in almost seven years. I have no friends and never have. I was alone in high school. I was alone in college. I was alone in grad school. I've been alone since then too. Basically no one other than my parents ever talks to me or asks about me.I have no professional successes to speak of. I work a shitty job that I'll be out of in a few months as the place I work is closing. I've never made more than $50K/yr in my life. I don't own a house. I haven't saved a lot for retirement because I've never been able to afford to. I'm currently living with my parents and going to sleep at night in the same room I did when I was a toddler. I wake up every morning hating myself and go to bed every night hating myself.I have no hobbies that I'm good at or passionate about. I've felt self-conscious about my appearance all my life and while when you're in middle school or high school, you can hold out hope that you'll come out the other side of puberty looking better or that you can go to the gym and get a great body, I'm now at that point in my life where I'm getting gray hairs and lines on my forehead. Not only do I have no hope of my appearance improving, it is just going to get worse from here.My parents are getting old. Everyone else my age is married and has kids and good jobs and houses and has moved on. I missed out on all the fun parts of life and have nothing left but taking care of my parents in their old age, burying them when they die, and then growing old alone and having nobody to do those things for me. Is anyone reading this who *wouldn't* be depressed in my situation? It would be irrational *not* to be depressed. My life has been an empty, miserable hell. So what is the point of trying? Why am I taking so many medications and spending so much time and money on therapists? Just so I can numb myself to how awful my life is? So I can try to keep that numbness up until I die of natural causes?",0
"There‚Äôs literally nothing stopping me from killing myself, except for my fear of the pain. I could never do it, no matter in what state I am in that moment.

I‚Äôm not religious, I‚Äôm an atheist, I don‚Äôt believe in an afterlife. If there were an afterlife, I wouldn‚Äôt even fucking want that and would try to end myself again in the afterlife LMAO.

I just want to sleep and be awake at appropriate times. ,0
I suffer from a panic disorder anxiety and depression and I just don't like think I can take this world anymore. Today I've noticed how much hatred is in this planet and how much my family actually does not wamt me around and I can't even go in public without someone I use to be friends with making things up about me all because I finally left and ignored everyone. But you can only go so far. From being threated by my own family to getting my tires slashed over something as small as me blocking everyone and trying to stay away from the toxic people. And to top it off I've been dealing with panic and thinking everyday is going to be my last. There's so much that's been happening to me and I can't take one more second of it. I think it would be better if I just went off and starved to death in the woods or something so no one can find me and I can rot away. I simply can't stand being here any longer. I'm sorry. ,0

I approached a good friend of mine who I knows been there heavily and I vented about how I feel and talked about how somehow for some reason I‚Äôm here. He said it‚Äôs honestly a gateway drug that starts with chicken scratches and ends up with bear knives and ur blood hitting the ceiling.

"I have to admit, shamefully, that l used to be a bully.I could say that I hung out with the wrong people, which is true, but the bullying started with me. I said terrible and disgusting things, especially to a person I'll call Jerry. He didn't have it easy. His father had cancer, and his family was deeply in debt, and yes, that's exactly what I made fun of (I could punch myself in the face). At first, it was only behind his back, but as the group got bigger, the cooler I wanted to appear, and I said something horrible to his face, and he wasn't impressed. I never had any problems with teachers or his family because of it, which I deserved, but luckily I didn't, but l'll get to that later. His father died, and he had to repeat a year because he missed so much school, even before his father started chemotherapy, and so on. I also had to repeat a year because of a grade. I was separated from my friends and put into a class with Jerry. We ended up just ignoring each other. He's introverted with people anyway, except for me now, and I didn't make any friends in a class where nobody knew me. When I started bullying, it stayed that way for a while, but I found a friend in the class whom I now call Sam. Sam was also friends with Jerry, which I didn't know. For two days, we went on a school trip and were allowed to visit the zoo in groups of four. So, it was me, Jerry, Sam, and someone irrelevant to the story. We formed a group.By then, I had changed so much that I wanted to talk to Jerry, and we did, discovering we had a lot of shared interests. The topic came up, and I tried to downplay it, but it almost made him angry, so l let it go and sincerely apologized for everything I had done. He accepted the apology and said, ""I know you mean it and that you will do better in the future.I forgive you."" I was speechless that someone I had treated so badly would say something like that to me. Today, we are both 22 and 21 and are best friends, but I haven't forgiven myself. Sometimes, when I am alone, I think about these things, start to cry, and wonder if I even deserve his friendship.",0

"This is gonna be a long story. So tldr at the end. Wanted to type this all out. I grew up in a very religious and conservative environment. I was indoctrinated into this religion from a very young age. Not to mention that the entire society and culture was structured to be very conservative as well. This included very little to no interaction between the boys and girls. From a very young age, our schools were segregated as well. It was in this all boys school/environment where I started to develop my understanding of sex. It was not a good environment to do that. Things were super toxic. Sex and porn were constant topics in the classroom. The school was so bad at handling all of this that almost our entire classroom was watching pornography in the IT lab. Even with the professor being there sometimes. There were kids who would jerk off in the class sometimes or show their penises to each other. Something that I partook in as well. I remember our library lesson was also mostly about this subject. We would get the biology textbook and go to the chapters about reproduction. But it was not just reading, other students had drawn profane images on the book. So we would look at them and perhaps make our own contribution. This was also the time when pornography became a thing in my personal life. It's difficult to remember how much was there but there was plenty of it. Being from a conservative environment, conversations about sex was a taboo. So my introduction and understanding of sex was solely developed through pornography and my school environment. My parents never talked about it. Many years later, my dad only briefly mentioned something about wet dreams but that's about it. This early part of my life I vehemently hate. Most people find their childhood innocence something that they cherish. But I didn't have that I suppose. I hate this part of my life so much that if I can go back in that, I'd kill that part of me.Sometime after, I moved out of this school to a co-ed school. Things got better. My outlook improved. I struggled to make female friends though. And there was a lot of shame and guilt associated with even trying because of my religious upbringing. I remember one time, our school had an event and one of my female classmates tagged me in a post on Facebook. I did not have any privacy on my account so my dad saw it. And he got very angry at me, even though I never asked her to share it and the picture wasn't even with me and her, it was of the entire class. My dad forced me to block that female classmates on Facebook. This school was in a more progressive city. So kids were in relationships. And I remember being very intrigued by that idea. Intellectually I always thought that dating and relationships were a good way to know your partner and if they fit. But I thought that God knew better and I should stop thinking these stupid thoughts. But I knew to stay away from it. However, this was the place where I developed my first really bad crush. I liked her so much. But the purity values of my religion always made me feel bad about even thinking about holding her hand, let alone anything else. I used to take pride that my thoughts about her were pure. That when I'd day dream about her I would never think about holding her hand or kissing her, even after marriage (in my head). I felt awful about watching pornography because of the same reasons so I started trying to avoid it. And I did. I would not watch porn or jerk off for six months. This also became my first experience with rejection but that's a separate story. Eventually I entered university which was one of the most liberal universities in my country. I had heard stories about people being in relationships and having sex and I had heard about my parents concerns about that with me. So I decided to avoid having relationships. I did want to have female friendships, to improve myself and my confidence with talking to girls. Also, to further improve my view on women and topics like gender roles. Due to growing up in a religious family, I had a very patriarchal view on these subjects. Nevertheless, I felt lonely and I craved romantic love and affection. This was also the time when pornography re-entered in my life. But I hated myself for watching it. I was ashamed of being someone who interacted with pornography, especially on somewhat regular basis now. Which for me meant once a week. University was also the place where I started getting suicidal. I never tried to kill myself but I started self harming, and the methods for worse and more extreme. When I graduated from University, I left with all these feelings with me. The suicidal ideation, the self harm, the shame and guilt, and the loneliness. All these feelings got worse. Eventually, through some reflection and realizations. I left the religion behind. And I felt betrayed. I thought It always made sense to me that relationships (even ones that involved pre-marital sex) were not bad. But I never allowed myself to think that. But also, I realized that a religion that focused on purity had none itself due to our various injunctions. At this point, I grow a desire to explore this side of me and thought to turn towards paying for it. But I stopped myself. The most I did at that point was buy lube for the first time to know what that feels like. However, I wanted to try my luck at relationships and I did. Even in cases where I knew pre-marital sex was not possible (due to their beliefs), I thought if they accept me as a irreligious person, I don't mind. At this point, my parents also were pushing to get me married. My family has a lot of marriages done to improve business ties with other families. So now that we were of age my dad wanted to do that too. However, I declined...many times. I declined often enough that at one point my dad insulted me by saying that ""are you gay?"" (For context, being from a very religious culture and country, people here very strongly hate LGBTQ people... Including my family). Regardless, I tried the to enter into a relationship for two years. While I tried to make sure the intention was to be in a relationship and not to have sex (I would give myself extra time to reflect on this). Near the tail end of this time period, things started to feel muddled. I felt like I wanted to know what that felt like and I felt bad for being a virgin at 25. I felt even worse for consuming pornography and that being the only sexual outlet I had ever had. This went on for a while. Recently, these feelings become heightened. And I wanted to experience what it was like and I wanted to get this feeling out of my system. So I had sex with a prostitute. And I hate myself even more now. I hate that I did it. I feel like I've ruined myself. Despite intellectually not having any problem with sex work or sex workers in general and not judging others who I know have done the same. I can't help but feel awful about myself. Since it happened, I can't help but feel constantly anxious and depressed. And if I was suicidal before, I can't help but feel that after this, I have to go through with it. I have to. And I feel like it's about time that I wipe my wretched self off this planet. I have been thinking about this ever since it happened. I feel so done with life. I already wrote my suicide note and goodbyes a while ago. It would be kinda funny to write an update. So I feel like all I need to do now is pull the trigger. Thank you to everyone who made it till the end. I appreciate you reading my ramblings. Tldr: I always had a weird and unhealthy relationship with my sex life and sexuality. I recently had sex with a prostitute and I hate myself for it. I have been suicidal before but I feel like at this point I'm done with my life. I already wrote my suicide note and goodbyes a while ago and I feel like I just to need to plan my death and get this over with. ",1

"It's been a rough week. 1 year ago my 1 year old kitten, was hit by a car and died. I found out days later when her body was brought to me, and while crying I burried her in my garden.

I feel like I want to end it now. What's the point? I have no family, no friends, I have no one. Not exaggerating, I actually don't have anyone.I can't do this. What's the point? I going to be in so much pain. I want to die.There has been so much shit in my life. Abused, mother who hit me and was on drugs, she was p\*do and liked wo touch me and force me to watch p\*rn with her when I was 6-12. I was attempting suicide at 10 years old, doctors, mental institutions, abuse...My father killed himself last year by using a **chainsaw** on a barrel with oil inside. It blew up. He had no face. He died. He abused me as much as my mother did. But the way he chose to die.. it's disgusting.Sorry for ranting.. hugs &lt;3",1
My arm is opened it's bleeding like a lot I'm in my room alone its soo deep that i can see my flesh ,1
"When people tell me that ""others will be hurt"" if I was to die, is a very invalid arguement to the depressed in my view. First off, if I'm super depressed, do you really think I'm gonna care about what other people will think/feel? No. And second, I find it unfair to continue living my life in depression for the sake of ""making others happy"" when said people rarely even reach out to me or reach back if I initiate. So like, remind me again how my absense would make ""that big of an impact on others"". Simply just on less empty seat at dinner, like Ive always been my life. Just a lonely empty seat.",1
I just don't know what to do at this point. I've been so proactive in seeking out mental health treatment but it's done absolutely nothing. Really just want to die so the pain goes away,1
"Recently I‚Äôve realized that I won‚Äôt ever be a normal, functioning adult. I‚Äôm literally struggling with the most basic tasks in the world like brushing my teeth or doing laundry. Big cities are terrifying af and I hate crowds. I am super sensitive to sunlight and either always feel too hot or too cold, never at the right temperature. I cannot sit at a desk or on a chair like a normal person because my entire spine will hurt. Sitting in a car is a nightmare. Can‚Äôt enjoy most types of food or alcohol because my stomach is so sensitive lol. Feels like I was intelligent once but my brain broke a while ago and now i am dumb. Can‚Äôt even have proper conversations anymore. For years i had extreme anxiety but i think i finally wrecked my brain and now i‚Äôm emotionally dead, stopped caring about basically everything. If it weren‚Äôt for the fact that other people take care of most things for me i‚Äôd have kms years ago. I literally can‚Äôt do the most basic things ever and don‚Äôt think i‚Äôll ever be able to. I was just not made for this world. I‚Äôm tired of pretending that i want to do any of this, just to die at some point anyway. Nothing successfully distracts me anymore. I want the void and the void wants me. My sleep schedule is complete garbage. Doesn‚Äôt matter if i have to wake up at 5am for weeks, the second i can ruin my sleep schedule again that‚Äôs exactly what happens, going to bed at 3 or 4am. My body wants at least 9hrs, tho it easily happens that i sleep 10-11 hrs. Sleeping is soooo good. Losing consciousness is literally the best feeling. That feeling of completely fading away before sleep, surgery, or passing out is the only good feeling in the world. I hate being trapped in a body, given that i‚Äôm almost always uncomfortable, in pain or exhausted, and i hate having thoughts. I really only crave nothingness now. How is someone like that supposed to live in this world? I‚Äôm just so tired of having to exist. Tbh, i‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs a genetic thing. So many family members with mental illness. And it only gets worse with age. Might as well end it now before i make even more terrible memories and become even more of a burden. If anyone actually read all of this, thanks. ",1
"I have faults. SA‚Äôd for several years between 6~12, foster care for a couple years, abusive father ran out on us at 10, mom never around and rather have not had us as kids so she shut herself out of her life until we became adults. I made mistakes. I hurt people. My siblings being some of them. I kept people at a distance throughout school. I thought I came out on top. Made some friends, got engaged and married - went back to school. I patched up my relationship with my siblings. Had a daughter. I came out as trans in 2011~2013, and it all fell apart starting 2018. They said they were cool with it.. they weren‚Äôt. Everyone left me. I think some of the reason is because I‚Äôm fundamentally broken as a person. Idk. Disowned by spouses family, mother said I disgusted her. Dropped out of college. Spouse asked for divorce and announced a new partner in 5 minutes. I was angry sometimes throughout my marriage. Never abusive I just shut down and got quiet. I got depressed. They left me at that point.  Ex refuses to let me see my child. Suicidal ideation in 2019 landed them primary custody. I want my daughter. I want a family. I want friends.My name is Megan. I‚Äôm 36 years old. I have memories, and emotions. I have my own history. I am a person. I was a person.

"I have posted on here before, and no one ever responded to it, so I'm doubting anyone will even read this anyways. I don't even know why I am posting this as I don't want attention or to make people feel bad for me or anything.Each time I have tried to kill myself by pills, nothing came of it. I just vomited everything up, and then got told off by my mum, accusing me of being pregnant and having morning sickness. But I have now learned and decided that overdosing never works for me so I must try a different method.In less than an hour, I am going to hang myself in my closet. I won't be found until around 6pm the next day when my mum comes in to my room for some odd reason like needing the mirror or something. No one will find me until I'm too gone and too blue to resuscitate. I will finally be released from the torment of that is my own life.

"He sits in solace, the night is cold,Thoughts of ending it, the stories told.Pull the trigger, ease the pain,The devils whispers in dark refrain.Hold on tight, there's more to seeAn angel cries with it's hopeful plea.End it now, it's all too muchA devil's voice, a deadly touch.In the night, a choice is made,To face the dawn or to be afraid.A flicker of hope, or the shadows call,Will he break free, or proceed to fall?",1

"To be clear this is a rant, for no other purpose but to rant about my life. I've been having some chronic conditions for years now which have only been getting worse of course, especially since nobody gave a shit. Not only cognitive declining but was also very recently diagnosed with scoliosis which somehow is really advanced but not enough for it to be operated, just the right amount for it to be a liability and that's it. On top of that I've had trouble breathing for a long time now, feels like I'm a 40+ years smoker when in reality I'm still young and haven't tried a cigarette in my life, sometimes it gets to a point where I'm spitting and tasting blood for a few days but also couldn't call it a huge problem since I don't do shit thus don't need to catch my breath a lot. In a similar note I've had a mole for some time now which looks like every example of sarcoma ever, more than 5mm wide, has different colours and irregular borders, it itches and I think it has grown a bit with time, and I've also noticed a few other new moles appearing where there was nothing before. Just hoping that something takes me already whatever it is but it's taking way too long, even if I feel like total shit every single day I cannot be sure what's causing it and I don't even remember feeling right, so who's to say that I won't have to stop being a coward and do the job myself. I don't deserve a merciful end, I do know that for sure. All that I can hope for in this moment, is that this gets automatically removed cause I don't seem to learn my lesson and shut my mouth when talking to people has only made matters worse through my life at best, something tells me that posting here yet again won't change that outcome.Can't even remember how many times I've posted in here with this one just to later delete it, my stupidity is incompatible with life at this point.Hope you can have a nice day, if you read this, it's not very uplifting lurking around here.",1
"I'm over it all. I've been alive and dead at the same time for 35 years. I've never felt alive. I've never enjoyed life. My whole life I've felt used and mistreated and none of the friends I've made have stuck around. They've moved on. Have their own friends and families. I haven't had a vacation in years. I'm so overworked and physically and mentally beaten, and I don't see it ever getting better. I'm trapped and the only way to free myself from this is to put an end to it all once and for all.I opened up about this recently and was told it's a cowardly way to go, but fuck anyone who thinks that. I'm taking the power back that's been stolen from me. I'm finally taking the matter into my own hands, because it's either this or I go out burning everything down around me.I'm choosing the peaceful path.I've already donated or trashed all of my belongings, except for this phone, and quit my job. It feels nice to own nothing and be free from working, but I know that this feeling can't last for long.I've already deleted all of my social media accounts except for this one, but after I hit post I'm deleting this account as well and destroying this phone and shortly thereafter ending this miserable life that's barely belonged to me.",1

I have no one to blame but myself. I don‚Äôt want to return to work but I think the bigger problem is that I feel like I have nothing to live for. No purpose. Not close with family. No friends. Even if I can get the money back somehow eventually but what for? I am just chasing a number and in the end I have no real purpose. Wish I can end it all but I am not sure I am capable of doing it.Sorry for the rant. ,1
"I‚Äôm posting here because the detrans sub is already fucked enough as is.I want to just fucking die already. I think about killing myself every day and it‚Äôs basically a constant loop. For context I was a ‚Äú‚Äùtrans kid‚Äù‚Äù and transitioned 15-19, ftmtf and HRT and a mastectomy. I fucking hate the trans community and the medical industry for encouraging minors to transition. I never got the help I needed and was basically brainwashed into thinking that I‚Äôd commit suicide without transition.I was suicidal back then and now I‚Äôm exponentially more suicidal. I fucking hate being alive and always have. Transition was just medically assisted self harm and I realize now a huge part of my gender dysphoria was discomfort or trauma or whatever the fuck with being sexualized from a young age and internalizing that my body was a sex object for being female. I also fucking hate men and being around them. I especially hate my male surgeon, who operates on minors and is a Fucking freak. Literally the closest thing I can compare my mastectomy to is rape. That‚Äôs what it feels like. A middle aged man literally butchered me as a teenager and had his hands inside my body, and the sick thing is that he probably gets off to this shit. I don‚Äôt know what else to call it. These surgeons are complete sadists and snake oil salesmen. Literally fucking disgusting anyone does this shit to mentally ill teenagers.I am basically nonfunctional at this point and I see no point in continuing to live. I would rather die than live like this for 50+ years. My only concern is my parents but I‚Äôm pissed at them too for being so stupid as to believe any of this trans shit. I don‚Äôt care if I‚Äôm perceived as transphobic. Trans people who encourage this mutilation for minors are fucking disgusting to me and I have nothing but complete contempt for them. I just want to die so I don‚Äôt have to suffer anymore. I can literally never have my old body back and it‚Äôs not like this is normal trauma. It‚Äôs some hellish abomination of medical experimentation/sexual exploitation/child abuse. The mental trauma of this experience is arguably worse than the physical trauma. It is literally impossible to deal with and I‚Äôm giving up.",1

"Please read my story. No one else did.My name doesn't matter. My experiences only mattered to me. I'm a realist. I need to know that I finally had the courage to write my story.If things look perfect on the outside, no one cares to see if it is true. Is it fear? Is that what stops everyone? I grew up nowhere. Six states. I lived in 6 states by the time I was 18. My family is great because of the money they make, right? I have four siblings. We must get along, right? You weren't abused. It's all in your head. Don't say anything. CPS? LIE. Don't you dare say a single word. Shhhhh. It gets better, right?Mom and Dad do not love you. You are not enough. You have to be perfect. Remember when you got a B in geometry in 7th grade? Screaming and so much fear. I wonder why.College was supposed to make it better, right? No, it's a cycle. You are the only thing in common. It's not the professor harassing you. You are just sensitive. And crazy.Here's a psychward stay. It doesn't matter that this is the one time you didn't even feel suicidal. This is what happens when you ask for help. Here it is! But, where's my prescription? Oh, they didn't give me one. What was the point?All you do is remember. You remember your first job? Second? Third? What about your internships? I bet you remember the one where you vomited out of fear every single day. No one could help you. Your boyfriend had your parents come up. Great idea, right?You have been a ghost for months. Can't eat, can't sleep. When was the last time you looked in the mirror? You don't even want to shower. You don't want to get out of bed.Holes in your teeth. Pain in your back every single second. Locked jaw. Is it enough yet? No one can protect you. No one did.You are alone now. Everyone who promised to stay? They didn't. Your biggest fear was being alone. Now, you are. It never mattered how hard you tried.Do you remember your first significant other? The girl who resulted in your parents disowning you? Love isn't worth it. She wanted one thing and she got it. It felt good, right? Gay people go to Hell.21. You were never supposed to live that long. At 16, you wanted to end it. You should have listened. 5 years of pain. You don't have to listen to the people telling you that you are wrong. You are tired of hearing it. They say you don't deserve death. So yet again, you aren't enough.You are ugly and fat. Your skin is bloody and scarred. You can't move without pain. Your voice doesn't even sound right. You have no clothes that are newer than 2 years ago. You have nothing to prove you are worth anything. I think you are. I think you deserve peace. It's inhumane to keep you alive. I don't love you, but I know you. You can't trust people. You can't speak. You are incapable of learning. You don't have to carry guilt. You're stuck in a dead end job with horrible pay. You made more at 17. If someone could tell me how, I would appreciate it. I've failed everything. I can't fail this. I won't get justice. If I'm dead, no one can pretend nothing bad happened. Please.",1
"My job at a DIY hardware store is making me suicidal.There's so much toxicity, lack of effort from management and toxic management that it's making me suicidal.Between the lack of understanding with my disability(orthostatic hypotension with vasovagal syncope) and them blowing payroll so much that I'm the only cashier all day for 9 hours....to guests cussing me out about said issue as if it's my fault.I can't take much more...The thing is...the money is good.

" I just want you to know that I really tried, but I can‚Äôt enjoy life. my mental health is getting to a point that is torturing me there are some things that I used to love like my job, or painting and being with my dog ;Sometimes I get distracted and I feel that I am happy and that I am part of something and that my life has meaning and I connect with people, but when I get distracted I become careless and I cannot control my impulses and my addictive personality; and I get in trouble, and I get others in trouble I have this disturbed side of me that is getting worse with the years.  therapy and medicines do not help me a lot , I have tried many things, spiritual, terrenal, all on my possibilities , I have moved all over the place , I had pray , I had ask for help,  groups etc ... I don't know if it's me or the source, if I'm not doing it right, if I'm not trying hard enough. But each time I feel worse, I have read every article about what I have but I just find layers and layers of patterns that I don‚Äôt know how to heal  . Is like having cancer in my personality. And is always spreading and mutating into something else and it affects every aspect of my life , my relationships, my work, my mood, my sleep, the way I perceive the world , the way I perceive myself I don‚Äôt even know who I am . or what I‚Äôm doing here . it all started way before I was born , my dad wanted to have a family for all the wrong reasons. He is a narcissist psychopath He is a doctor but one that doesn‚Äôt believe in mental health. Of course he had never attended therapy and his diagnosis is based on the therapist of everyone else From the outside we looked like a good family but inside he terrorized me, and kept my mom around with manipulations and pregnancies. He had this big plans and expectations for me. That when I started develop my own personality he did make sure to crash it. He abused me and every way , he used to molest me since I can remember up to when I was 12 . He build a wall between me and my older sisters . Every day he didn‚Äôt miss the opportunity to remember that I wasn‚Äôt the son he wanted. I didn‚Äôt knew what was happening I just remember the fear and how uncomfortable was to be around him . At the age of 8 I began to have insomnia and fantasies about dying as a teenager became more accentuated and the nights terrified me because my mind was spinning in all directions; my mother tried to help me and took me to a therapist but I don't know what happened that I began to fall into a spiral of more abuse, addictions, suicidal thoughts, codependency, failed relationships, self-sabotage, low self-esteem, and now I am here at 36 acting like a teenager. I don't know if I lacked time to fully understand and be able to evolve. But now I feel like I have no way out and the negative consequences of my stupid decisions have caught up with me. I put myself over the edge so I had no other option but to jump. Because other times I regretted it or failed in the attempt, or I found the way out this time is different it feels very real. the constant use and abuse  that my father put me through definitely marked me, I guess is I‚Äôm my genetics , and the environment I grew up was perfect for me to develop this ‚Ä¶ I had blamed him I hated him. but it doesn't matter anymore, I am at peace with it. And I forgive him. now I know that at least my mother loved me after all. I don't want to carry resentments. I know that I was wrong many times and I ended up hurting people. And that is also why I made this difficult decision, I am afraid of causing serious or irreparable damage with my actions. Until now I was just a toxic person, I regret tormenting my mother and exposing my family with things that no one was prepared for, cheating on my partners and stealing things from stores. Telling lies , using people , I definitely had some narcissistic traits. And the guilty and shame is genuine. I am a coward for not facing the justice of man but I simply cannot conceive what it would be to go to jail, with the disorders that I have . I feel a fraud because everything I stole and that in the rush of adrenaline made me feel good, I don't want to damage the reputation of the program , I don‚Äôt feel like I should be around this kids anymore; I failed them, I failed everyone.I feel like ending my life is the right thing to do. I've been planning and postponing it for years, I also did good things in life and I hope those things are enough for me to rest in peace I hope people remember me for those things for. My food, my jokes when I was in a good mood. My empathy for people with some difficulty. I want to take with me the good memories and the good deeds. It breaks my heart to know that I am going to hurt you and other people, because at the end of my days I realized that there were people who appreciated me and who saw me . And saw that I really tried ‚Ä¶. ",1

My mother died January 8, 2024, and I‚Äôm not only numb to it, I‚Äôm angry, upset, sad, and it took so much, and so much joy from my life. I already wasn‚Äôt experiencing much joy because of my own problems and issues, but that destroyed me. I now have to deal with my dad talking to a girl half his age, and 3 years younger than me(I‚Äôm 31). There was an incident last week where he called me around 7am asking if I could come over to be a witness as she was yelling acting crazy on the phone with him. Mind you, wtf is stopping this girl from lying saying my dad and me hit her. He asked me to come over because he thought she was bringing her cousin, and another woman, and he didn‚Äôt want it to be 3 against 1. I told him and had to check him on that cause my heart hasn‚Äôt pounded like that since the day my mom died. My car was in the shop, and the house my parents are living in is a few blocks over. Had to wake my brother up, to use his car because mines was in the shop. We zoom over there, and I hopped out the car fast to see what was going on as she just pulled up in my dad‚Äôs car. Oh he‚Äôs been letting her drive his cars now. I told him yesterday I felt a way about him letting her drive moms little Honda, I‚Äôm really sick of this shit, and want to move away. I‚Äôm trying to get my life together. I‚Äôm sick and tired of my feelings being fucked with. I‚Äôm on edge and want to be done with everything. No woman wants a big guy, it is what it is, and quite frankly I‚Äôm fucking tired of thinking about women. From all I‚Äôve seen they just bring headache to lives, I rarely see a woman be a calm factor to a man, just my perspective and what I‚Äôve see . My mom was the epitome of a headache. I went on a road trip yesterday and I kept thinking about my mom, and started to cry while driving but stopped myself quick, a few tears formed.

No one needs to keep caring for the burden that is me.I was at the river, then went back inside‚Ä¶ but nothing is really stopping me from going out again.What is wrong with me",1

"I‚Äôve had these thoughts before. Since i was about 22 or so. Im currently 27. Not really done anything serious or an attempt before. But its been on my mind on and off. 2023 was a great honestly. But in January 2024 my bf broke up with me. This broke me, i thought i was going to get married with him. we had already talked about moving in this year. Things were serious. I got into therapy and started to work on myself. And for a moment it was working. I spent a lot in credit cards but then where i was working i had to quit. So i have a bunch of debt that i thought i could pay off fast.. I got my dream job after that but they let me go just in two months. Because of money cuts etc etc and they didn‚Äôt pay that well so im still with the debt. i tried dating someone new and i put up my walls because i was scared but i said okay. This new guy is way different and he seems like he‚Äôs really into me. But then he also left me. Im adopted and my adoption family treated me like shit so i don‚Äôt speak with them. My biological mother and i sometimes see each other but she moved on. Has a family with 2 daughters and basically gave them the perfect life. So i don‚Äôt really have a family. I dont have any close friends. I  don‚Äôt even have a college degree. And a whole lot of other trauma that i have when i was five and SA. So basically therapy was working but this last month my dream job fired me, the guy i was dating left me, im up to my ear with debt, cant find a job, no one really to help me out. So im just considering death. Im not really looking for help anymore. I don‚Äôt think my life will get better or i will do something meaningful. So im just done. Any tips for a 100% suicide not anything where i might survive or have brain damage. Just fast and not as painful. Something also that i can do soon. I thought about buying a nitrogen tank but its kinda expensive and they don‚Äôt t sell you enough to die. Maybe overdose.. ive never done drugs so any tips would help. I thought as well drowning. And it could seem as accident and not suicide. Like i said i dont want help anymore. I tried working on myself and it just didn‚Äôt work. ",1
"I'm writing this in case I need it.I think I'm getting close to the end of everything that needs to be done. I still go about, playing out my life, as if everything could be fine after all. I do it for those I love primarily. I cry still, but it mostly doesn't hurt. 'I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best, though it never felt right' - is a quote from Sufjan Stevens, from the song I'm listening to right now. It sums up what I feel pretty well. I've wanted to love, and be loved back, for so long. It's a simple thing, one which always comes for free, and yet I couldn't have it. 'The most expensive things in life come free'. That's another quote. I sometimes wished I'd had the courage to end everything earlier on, and other times I tried my best to keep going. For some reason. I was really proud of myself at times. But at last, there was nothing in my life but emptiness. I saw my boy, and his eyes were the most beautiful, the most perplexing thing ever. And then I spent my time doing nothing, watching the clock, waiting for everything to be over. 'To sleep.' he said, when I asked what he thought happened after death. 'You'll fall asleep.' I've spent many nights wishing I never woke up in the morning, being disappointed when Nothing ended. Perhaps when I forget myself at all, it will be a kind of peace. Perhaps not. Perhaps I see dreams in my forever sleep. I'm not sure I even want to make any arrangements for what is left behind of my existence. I told myself about a year ago, that I could die, of course, any time I wanted, but first I needed to finish up everything and anything I wanted or needed to do. It kept me going until now, which is impressive. But now I feel like it's finally coming to a finale. Perhaps I should talk to a priest and ask him to pray for my soul, so that God can welcome me with open arms when I pass. Perhaps I should tell my mother everything beforehand. I'm not exactly sure how to round this off, so this is it.",1

"Earlier today, I consumed 1,320 mgs of Duloxetine and 200 mgs of Lexapro. I intended to kill myself, but as I was crying and swallowing pills, my dog started to whine and she licked my face. I'm not sure if I want to die or not in this moment. I am kind of content with the thought that if I die, then I die, but I will not try for it further rn. And I doubt I will die since I know that overdosing on medication is one of the least effective methods of suicide.. i took the pills about eight hours ago. my symtoms so far are rapid heartrate, dry mouth, and my head feels woozy. i occassional get stabs of digestive pain but it passes quickly i'm also feeling very sleepy. how should i expect mt symptoms to continue to progress? is my lifr in danger or did i not take enough?i don't want to go to the hospital. that would be a very expensive medical bill",1

It's ironic. The only thing keeping me from getting the things I need to end myself the way I want is my depression. It's so bad I can't even move right now.,1
"is there genuinely anyone who doesn't care about tpeople appearance , the way they dress, the way they speak or look like and just look for human connection whenever i can. I see beauty and interesting things in anyone but myself. I feel completely embarrassed about my own existence and looks which makes it hard to connect to people while deep in my heart loving the world and genuinely everyone whos nice to me.  I have 0 friends because i genuinely hate everything about myself and refuse to even go outside.

"For the past too weeks I was really struggling with suicidal thoughts and I use S/H to combat it, I know its not the way to do it but it was working.  I just couldn't shake off the low feeling, even when I was around people I still looked rough and couldn't bring my mood up, so I resorted to my coping method but it just didn't help and I ended up OD'ing.I almost ended up being sectioned again but managed to be let go. All I wanted when I got back was for my friend to stay the night, I didn't want to talk about anything I just didn't want to be alone. I hate being alone and I'm always alone, I just needed this moment to have someone and feel like I was cared about.  It really feels like and looks like no one will love me the same way I love them or treat them. I'm always there to talk, to clean their room, clean them up, anything they need when they are low, why cant I have one night.  It just makes me feel so unlovable and replaceable, everyone has something going on for them, they have people who love them and would do anything for them and love them. I've got nothing, no family, barely any friends, no one who will be there for me when I need them, I just don't see the point anymore. I'm tired of being alone and being so depressed. My cptsd just makes life unliveable, constantly one after the other I'm being triggered by something and the flashbacks are so intense they leave me emotionally drained for days.  I don't regret attempting but now I'm just left feeling like its only a matter of time till it happens again.I'm just so alone, no one would miss me they'd just miss what I was able to do for them",1
"I always had moderate mood swings but give me a day or two and a shoulder to cry on and I would be fine. The problem was usualy bottling it up, but right now it is a bit different.This year will mark the end of my first year of college and probably what was the longest time that I felt like hell.I managed to get into a fairly good university in my country but once the classes started I immediately lost practically all motivation for everything. The studying for things that interested me before started to feel like Sisyphean work, I couldn't sit and pay attention in the class and I couldn't study at home. Only thing that helped me get through the first semester were a few friends that attended the same college, but as they improved and started to talk more about college, as most of the student's life starts revolving around it, I started to distance myself because I felt jelaous and bitter. Second semester went by not much better and for the most part of it I stayed in my room not having the will to go outside. Now it is summer I have one more chance to retake a few exams but I am unsure if there is even a point to it. I am not sure if I can even finish college or even if I do what will happen after it. I feel like my parents are disgusted by me even if they don't tell it to my face, they probably think I was a mistake or a waste of money. Especially my father since his favourite description of me is that I am smart enough to do anything, but too lazy to actually do it. I feel like they just wanted me to be more like my brother who is intelligent, very social, and very hard working and always picks himself back up no matter what.To sum up, since I entered college I have been feeling like dissapearing. The last few nights I jad trouble sleeping and for the last thirty minutes I have been fantasizing about getting a good knife.Maybe I am just too soft, too spoiled, or truly too lazy. I don't know anymore, I just want too feel like there is a point to what I am feeling, to have some kind of forseeable future of interests or something, because else what is even the point of all the time feeling like shit.Sorry for everything and thank you if you read this far.",1

"‚ö†Ô∏è((CW: Mentions of my experience suffering s‚Ç¨√óual and general abuse as a child/Parental Death))I can't believe I drive to the wrong location for a my job interview today. The market is so tight and it's hard to get interviews in my area already when the local Walmart requires a Bachelor's degree for something like online order filling. The job would've been absolutely perfect. I have PTSD due to child abuse/major depression/social anxiety and have a lot of issues with concentration/derealization/disassociation. I'm finally on meds but everythings just so slow. I'm tired. I know my psychiatrist will up my dosage tomorrow since he believes with all my symptoms that 50mg sertraline will most definitely not be enough.My mother died on the 12th of this month and after all the cries for help... nobody came. When I tried to reach out, help looked me dead in the face and said fuck you and walked away. My mother was an abuse victim who abused others and so much more and I had to function as her caretaker and she would give me a portion of her disability to distribute to the bills that needed to be payed plus my car insurance. Now that she's gone I have no income. We were living in my whellas old house together and I'm still here. I'm my whellas power of attorney for both finances/property and medical decision. I don't know where the paperwork is. If I had the paperwork, there may have been a possibility that I could've got the house under my name and sold it. I can't find it. I checked to see if any government agencies could provide a copy but they can't. The only way to get one is via the lawyer who set it up or to redo the papers altogether. I'm so done. So freaking done. What's the point? I can't be myself (LGBT+ stuff) because I can't I afford the healthcare. I'm poor as shit and will probably end up homeless. I don't have a desire to do anything but die and a shitty state mental health facility can't even help because their all packed to the nines. Innocent people are dying left and right and the people in power who can make a change don't give a shit/are in for the money and their evil desires only. I didn't ask to be born to a child molester rapist sperm donor ass shat child abusing peice of shit and a narcissistic schizophrenic bipolar entitled mother. I didn't CONSENT TO BE BORN. The fuck......why..?? Also, might be autistic/adhd but no one does adult diagnosiss in my area for free with insurance that I've been able to find. I'll have to ask my psychiatrist or therapist if they know any places... If it weren't for the poor elderly pupper I'm caring for, I'd take all of my mom's old meds then set myself on fire. Or drive off the super highway that leads to the major city near me. Or even just jump of the top of a neat by parkimg garage. So done. So ready to leave. Gotta get the dog in with my Uncle and Aunt so I can kick it. I haven't even been able to tell my sibling our mother had passed because they committed suicide like a week and half prior to her death (survived) and I have no clue what to do...The hell. End me. Cancer. Seizure. ANYTHING. FUCKING HELL. make it stop. Would it be bad if I just blew of 20 bucks of delta(legal in my state) to get baked as long as I stayed home and made sure my elder doggos needs were met??...im considering. I'm gonna make some lasagna or taquitos. Thanks for reading my vent ig. ",1

"I'm Living My Dream Life But I'm SuicidalSA and suicide Trigger warning ‚ö†Ô∏è I'm 22 and I'm living in America. I don't want to put my gender so I can get a neutral perspective. So for context I grew up in a very abusive environment. I was raped, beaten, and emotionally and mentally abused as a young kid by my mom's (now ex)boyfriend, and later on I was emotionally, physically, and mentally abused by my grandmother after till my senior year of highschool when my family got her an apartment to live in so we could all move away from her. She Is still in my life, but very minimally since my mom thinks family is very important. Every since I was a kid. Maybe 6 or 10 I don't remember my dream was to be happy most days. Later on it turned into I want to be happy most days, get help by a mental health professional, have kids and make sure I raise them in a healthy way, and be financially stable. I have that life now, minus the kids since there is no way in hell I'd be able to afford them and I also don't think that I've done enough healing to be able to a healthy parent. But I've gone above and beyond what I would have ever expected. I didn't think I would live past 16, but here I am, 22 and I think the happiest I've every been. I fixed the relationship with my parents as a adult, and they even realized what they did wrong and apologized to me. MY DAD IS EVEN IN THERAPY RN, and my mom and dad have improved themselves to be more emotionally healthy. My grandma even has slowly gotten better, according to my family i am very skeptical, but i can she that she is trying to improve our relationship and make right what she did to me. I even noticed that I dont despise being around her as much as i did before. I have a amazing and supportive partner that loves me. I am in the healthiest relationship i have ever been in. I literally cry sometimes because of just have grateful, privlaged, and happy i am. But, that changed when three days ago I made the realization that I am not living for myself but for others. That's how I stayed alive for so long, I've wanted to die so much but I told myself I can't because I know how it feels to lose someone close to you by suicide. I later told myself I can't die because my future kids need to be raised, and I need to break the generational cycle that my family has created. But after this realization I feel like I'm spiraling. Suicidal thoughts keep flooding my head, I'm using my therapy skills, and they mostly work, I tell myself that these are just intrusive thoughts and try to ignore them but they are just getting louder and louder. I've completed my life's dream and now what? I have no other dreams besides the one I have. I don't know if I even want kids because because of how America is rn, and just how much of a responsibility they are. I don't really see any upsides to being a parent anyways. Most parents I ask say don't have kids it's horrible. With my realization, I realized that I've been depressed for years now. Like yea, I have PTSD and stuff, but besides that I think deep down I've still wanted to die even at my happiest moments. I remember saying and think that I'm not scared of death. If it happens it happens, and that I would choose someone else's life over mine any day. But I think that I just feel stuck where I am I can't die but I don't want to live, and the only way put is if something happens to me. I can't commit suicide. I still really don't want to die but it's not out of fear, but other people. I've also hinted at this before with my therapist that I don't really feel like I have a life's purpose, and I feel like she kinda didn't know what to do. I'm also doing amazing in therapy rn, and I'm healing a lot, and I am no longer burdened by the shakles of my trauma Yea i might have a flashback every now and again, but i can work through them quickly and they dont really bother me. I have the emotional intelligence and skills to get me through most is not all of my stress, but this realization has hut me in a way that i dont know how to deal with. I didn't tell my therapist about this in our last session (yesterday), because of just how entitled and guilty i feel about how i have been feeling. She had helped me through all of my trauma prossesing. She has been there every step of the way and the has told me several times how proud she is of me for how far ive come. I dont want to disappoint her. Also I'm not religious. I was raised without it and I'm not going to start now, so please don't suggest that I find God or something. I don't hate religion i just dont think its for me. How do I create the will to live? How do find purpose in life after I have already completed my life's dream? Thank you all so much for your help, and any suggestions you may have. ",1
"I(24m) have been so unmotivated to live my life for the past 7 years. And that feeling has began getting worse since 2 years ago, I have become so withdrawn and tired of living. I never worked and dropped out of college out of guilt for my failing grades. And no, my mom isn't pressuring me to be good at school or anything. And that made me feel guiltier than before. The fact that I pursued something that I can't achieve. The fact that I have been too selfish, and I am not doing anything, and can't do anything to repay my mom for her sacrifices. Ever since then I've been too hard on myself. I keep punishing myself for not achieving the goals I had in my life. I couldn't forgive myself for being such a failure in life. I can't find a way out, to go back to living a normal, happy life as I had back then. I forgot to mention that I was already having suicidal thoughts back in high school because of my father. I wont talk about my family problems so as to not confirm to any relatives that might come across this post and realize that I posted here, hence why Im also posting on a throwaway account, but it all stems from my father.  Anyway, for the past 2 years, I have become too reclused and dying seems to be the only answer I have. I just want it to end. To disappear and be done with it all. But Im a coward. Im just waiting for something, someone to end it all for me. Add to that the guilt of not doing anything to better myself or my life, it's making my suicidal thoughts worse. Im just here in my room, slowly rotting and wasting away. I feel powerless against this feeling, and what's worse is I brought this all to myself. I only have myself to blame for being a failure. I dont even know why I am writing this all down here. Is this a call for help? My final words in case I do end myself sooner than I anticipated? I can't tell anymore. I can't do this any further, I have wasted away so much time not doing anything meaningful in my life and I have punished myself repeatedly and now, I'm just, done. I don't want to live anymore. ",1

"I hate myself. I am up to my shoulders in student debt. I can only blame myself because I never tried to have get a job since the last 3 years, it will show on my resume and none would want to employ me. I've started to gather debt from friends and family too. Saying that I would do my best to gather a portfolio of programming projects. I did nothing. My friends wonder why I never did anything with piano which people thought I was talented at. I've spread myself too thin, too many interests going nowhere. Why don't I study enough. I thought I lost weight but then I saw pictures of my self recently and I look like a pig. I lost a sentimental water bottle, a speaker and my glasses within one week. Broke my phone and fixed it for 200 e and then broke it again the next day. People at a student organization hate me because im tardy and dont come over on time.Some of them look down when they walk past ne but then up when I'm past them in the uni hallway. When I'm by myself, and think about when I've hurt people or made an ass out of my self, I say out loud that I should kill myself. I've done that for a few years and I haven't been able to stop it. Held my leg over the railing today, and then walked by a lake thinking that I should drown myself. I cannot tell anyone about this because I dont want them to worry. But then I think about how they could get over it If I passed. They wouldn't have to take care of me. ",1

"What is it called when you know you don‚Äôt actually want to die, you just need a break. A just break. And all the ways you can think to get said break result in it sounding like you just don‚Äôt want to live??Life confuses me. I was handed a weird one and I know it‚Äôs all I get and that‚Äôs frustrating. Just like anyone else I had a mom who had so many of her own issues, I was invisible. And I made myself stay that way. My brothers keep my parents on their toes enough for the bulk of us.So I was alone a lot. Which seemed to fit me fine. I could spend hours in my own head.Turns out not only do I got trauma induced brain, it seems to also contain a little of the autism and the adhd ‚ÄîThen I get into an abusive relationship at 17, get stuck with him at 23 when I got pregnant. I now have the most wonderful 13 year old who legit saves my life every day just by existing.But 10 years of abuse in all the ways- finally was able to leave once I came to terms with the fact ‚Ä¶ OH SHIT, I‚Äôm gay!!So then started my life over at 27. It‚Äôs been 10 years since that happened and how is it I‚Äôm just now kinda getting a hang of life??I started therapy last year and it just seems like the more I get to know who I really am- the more people go away. The more I get into arguments with my gf over my needs. My teeth have taken all the years the worst, and are slowly decaying out of my mouth. And it‚Äôs all just‚Ä¶ idk.Nothing seems real. I feel like a video game character living in the twilight zone.Each day I wake up thinking or hoping or trying to make the day mine. To be motivated and do the things and ‚Ä¶ then I cry and get overwhelmed about something and then the day gets away from me- and then you try again.And again.And it‚Äôs always the same.No matter what.So what the actual fuck is the point? To go in the merry go round of shit? To just constantly be struggling just to exist because that‚Äôs all the energy we have?Worry about money, food, life, love, trauma, why am I the way I am‚Ä¶. Every day until we randomly die? We get no say or instructions.Like am I finally going to get it together and then get cancer and die before enjoying it like my grandma did?Am I just going to be fighting to feel some sort of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù like I see everyone else feeling? It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm constantly just chasing this non existent feeling of belonging. Of feeling content. Happy even. Idk. It all just seems so silly. What‚Äôs the point? Look at this world. Unless you have beautiful skin and features and then access to power and money‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre fucked. Anyways, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.I start talking like this with anyone else and they start looking at me like they need to take me for a grippy sock vaca again. But then no one actually talks about any of this and we all just pretend it‚Äôs just what it is and life keeps moving so stop thinking so much about it.",1
"Life can be so strange,I feel I'm in a privileged space,I have the most wonderful girlfriend I could ever have dreamt of, I have a very good job considering my low education . Yet I feel like I'm always in this anguish state. Every thing stresses me so much to a point of making me sick. I'm doing so much better now after a good decade of stalling and depression. Yet at time especially during more stressful time, I feel like I'm being envelopped in this darkness.Sorry for thoughts in all directions , plus English isn't my first language",1
"I‚Äôm 30 years old and I hate everything about me, I‚Äôm obese unattractive and have a tiny dick. I just bought my first home about 2-3 years ago and regret it so much, I‚Äôm a loser who can‚Äôt keep a job, I‚Äôve had at least 6 jobs in the last 5 years and I keep not going to work because I‚Äôm a fucking lazy pathetic piece of shit. Everything that‚Äôs wrong in my life is because of me, I can‚Äôt stay at one place because I keep thinking I can do better but I just keep making it worse. This last month and a half didn‚Äôt go to work just because I didn‚Äôt feel like it and I‚Äôve been unemployed with no calls about work. I ended up telling my mom about it and she was disappointed with me again and gave me 3 grand to help with my loan that I took out from the bank to help pay for my bills. I haven‚Äôt deposited it yet and I keep just lied to her about the new job I just got on Monday and didn‚Äôt go today. I lied to her and said I didn‚Äôt work today. I‚Äôm just a pussy who‚Äôs keeps telling my self I can fix it but I just keep messing up. This isn‚Äôt even all the money or things she or my dad have done for me throughout the years to help me because I can‚Äôt keep a job, all the thousands of dollars I‚Äôve cost them, the guilt keeps piling up. I‚Äôm a pathetic excuse for a son, she doesn‚Äôt deserve all the trouble I cash for her. I can‚Äôt even give her a grandson that she keeps saying that she wants from her sons. My brother who is the middle child is losing weight, just finished college and has been the manager of a food shop for a few years now and is everything I wish I was but I‚Äôm to weak to do what he does. My youngest brother thought about suicide a few months back, and I told him a whole bunch of shit that anyone would say to stop him from doing or thinking about it, like the loss and effect it would have on our family. What a fucking hypocrite I am. I don‚Äôt know who to talk to about this, I have no friends, the closest thing to a friend I have is my youngest brother, how pathetic for a 30 year old to only have his 20 year old brother be his only friend. I keep sitting here in my room looking at my gun think it would be so easy and so quick, I cold stop being a burden and a leach to my parents and just end it. The thought keeps popping up and I feel like it‚Äôs the right choice. I feel stupid for even typing this here, I‚Äôve seen some of the post on here and think that I have no right to post this while some people have real problems. Real attempts and self harm are going on and I‚Äôm just a fucking bum, idk if it‚Äôs attention or pity as to why I‚Äôm here. I keep telling my self I‚Äôm not here for that but idk what to do.",1
"I've never been happy with my life, Ive never been able to say that I love anything about myself. For as long as I can remember I've always hated myself so dearly. I grew up alone, excluded from the world, Ive been a loser for as long as I could remember. For most of my preteen years I was groomed and taken advantage of by people way older then me. Every relationship in my life has been transactional. Before I started highschool, I almost killed myself, After escaping a really long and toxic relationship with my groomer, I had nothing left to live for. I never once knew what it meant to really have a human connection with someone that was on the same level. The only times I felt like I did, it was because of a stupid dream I had or when I'd close my eyes and think of a life where I did have someone like that, a life where my parents cared about me, a life where I wouldn't hate myself. I was immensely bullied too, I thought that if I didn't like to live why live at all. So before highschool started, I made it a plan that two months after I graduate, I was going to kill myself.I had nothing left I wanted to do, and I don't want to keep on living with the guilt of everything that was ever done to me. I wanted to be the last person to ever hurt me. If I was going to die either way, I wanted to be the one to do it.The day is a year away, and so much has happened in my life that I don't want to die as much as I used to- but I still want to. I don't want to change, I don't want to think, I don't want to do or be anything and anywhere. I still hate myself, and I don't think that's ever going to change.",1

"I was borned in a poor town called ""Richville."" The house has holes that let in small animals, my parents yelled at each other and divorced when I was four years old. The government basically took the little money my parents had in legal fees. My father was very unstable and I had to be dragged around from house to house because he wanted company even though they hated him. I sat in trash that he horded in the car. On top of this, my family was religious and refused to directly help because my mother was a foreigner. Life got better for my mother but I always felt broken. I remember bringing a snowglobe to class and the kids broke it, it was all I had and felt like my world broke. The teachers and classmates made fun of me for being ""abnormal."" I felt like trash and still feel like trash. My vision is so messed up that I see sparks and I have scars on my body, subconsciously my mind and body wanted to die. I just feel like my body is just breaking, and that I don't have long to live anyway. I try to go to therapy and take meds but it does not work. My birth was a mistake that was due to desperate people getting together. I hate this world, I really tried but I can't stand living in this world.",1

I'm worried that there will be no job for me as a historian.    I'm so sick of the co-workers there. Only thing they want to talk about is football, and maybe so new Hollywood action movies, like this ""Deadpool vs Wolverine"". I got no problem with them being interested in this, but I can't be stuck in this environment. I got passion for history, politics and philosophy, and I want to discuss those things.    If I get kicked out from parent's house and I'm forced to rent, which is a poverty trap, and I can't get any other job than blue collar, I'd rather die than being stuck in that shit.",1

Maybe Ill mail the box of things that reminded me of you. Maybe they'll reach you, maybe they'll get returned to sender.   I wanted to explore more of me, and you, us.Emotionally, physically, sexually, intellectually.

"I am so... so very tired. My dog, who used to be perfect, got a spinal stroke about two months ago. Now he can't walk right, his behavior changed and he doesn't pee in his designated spots anymore, and now because he can't scratch his ears, he has ear problems. At the same time this happened, my grandfather went to the hospital for hemoglobin loss, and instead of fixing the damn problem the first visit, he had to go back two more times until they finally decided to do something about it. But he and his wife should have moved into a home sooner so that my mom, my only support, could stay with me, my father and my dog.

This is the worst country. I am in pain mentally and physically, and no one will help. There's no cure for my dog's spinal stroke. There's no cure for fibro. There aren't cures for anything. My parents have problems. My grandparents are burdens who refuse to move into a home. My dog used to be my only joy in this life but now he's a burden too. I just want it all to stop.

"You know I‚Äôve been thinking. All my life I‚Äôve been drawn to help others. I‚Äôve always gotten immense pleasure out of making people happy and problem free. I‚Äôve always thought we‚Äôre all the same, we‚Äôre all human, so we all must love helping and caring for each other. My god, how wrong i was! This is the planet of the douchebags. And the way they train good people to be douchebags is to attack them whenever they be good. Take advantage of every kindness, see how much they can get out of the sucker. Laugh at them and call them a pushover for wanting to help. Just wolves and sheep, either your a cruel piece of crap who takes all they can, or you‚Äôre a dumb sheep who loses out. The whole ‚Äúbe a good person‚Äù propaganda they keep spreading is just to get the sheep to reveal themselves so they can attack. This is a planet of predator and prey. And you think maybe humans have become intelligent and civilized and are beyond that animalistic stuff, but nooooo, humans are the worst of them all! Animals don‚Äôt know any better, their brains aren‚Äôt even capable of reason, only instinct. But humans know exactly what they‚Äôre doing and they still do it. Civilization just changed the way they be predators. Predators kill something and consume its resources, but humans advanced this process by now working their prey to death and extorting all the resources out of them threw labor. I mean look at the world, just money money money and people being forced to work to death. So for that rare person who was born a decent person by some weird genetic anomaly, you would rather die than play along with this despicable game of money. Iike wth, people enjoying enormous wealth, while other people literally starve, and everyone else is just cool with that? And then every now and then they get all moralistic about one little incident in the news and forget that the whole world is one big autraucity. Suddenly they give a damn about one little thing and then don‚Äôt give a damn the rest of the time, what a bunch of fake morality! What in the holy hell kind of people have i been born amongst ?! But i dont want to die, so what do i do? I guess become a douchebag at all costs! As a douchebag, I would no longer be suicidal because I would be ok when bad stuff happens to me. Like ‚Äúyeah, I deserve this, hahahha.‚Äù No more being depressed and miserable at the way everything is. As a piece of garbage, I would fit in great with this world! I would love this world! Like piece of trash in a landfill, you feel at home, everyone trying to screw each other over, take their money. And when life is terrible, you‚Äôre just like ‚Äúhahahaha, aw they got me, time to attack back and get them back! Rrooar!‚Äù Life is great as a douchebag! Now the problem is becoming one. Every instinct in my body is to be a kind caring person. And that is the key to suffering and misery in this world. I would rather die than become a douchebag, honestly, but idk i should at least give this douchebag thing a try. When in rome, right. Ok i can do it! Treat everyone like crap, and try and get their money! A good and strong way to be!",1

"29M autistic. Didn't even know I was autistic until last year. That makes things their own form of hard, could be the reason for all this, idk.I have always been interested in men as well as women, but I grew up debilitatingly religious. I was raised to do two things, love God, and become a great husband to a woman. So I got married. We will be married 7 years next month.My parents died, so I finally felt free enough to openly come out as pansexual. We were open for a bit so I could feel free, but then I got her pregnant like 4 months later. My son is pretty cool. He is almost 6 months old. Growing well.My parents chose my career died me as well. Been with the same company for over 7 years. Not a bad job, and it pays pretty well.My problem is all my life I was told how to life and how to love. By the time I got smart about it, I was really deep into people's dependence on me. I just want to enjoy life, but I have really been struggling to do so.When I get really high or drunk, it helps. But if I get too drunk I get even more suicidal. You would run that with a wife that needs me and a healthy son and a well paying job, I would be happy right? Nothing gives me joy anymore. I just want to get high or drunk so I can tell better. My wife isn't a bad person, just not a very good partner. At this point she is more my first child than my partner. Again, she isn't a bad person, just really dependant and don't have much capacity about taking care of me if I need it, emotionally.I don't believe that love exists. I believe that everyone that ""loves"" someone loves them for their expectations of them or their expectations of their role in their lives. This has been shown to me by my parents, my wife, that God I was supposed to believe in, and the final straw was my best friend. I got depressed and he got mad at me for not entertaining him as much as I used to when he would talk to me. Again, autistic, so when I get depressed I shut down.My body hurts, as I have sustained a few surgeries and some injuries. It always hurts, unless I am drunk or high enough.I know it seems like I'm bitching about being sad or something. I've seen people on here with way better reasons than me. But I'm just not happy. I'm living a life I never wanted for myself, because I only know how to give and give and give, and people don't really give back the same way I give, so I'm just running out.I want to be able to experience my sexuality without other people limiting me. I've been with men before, so I know what it is like. But right now, my only sexual option is my wife, which our whole marriage sex has been a weird topic, or masturbation, and the later is just not doing anything anymore.I worry about my son. What if I never get better, and my son just has a miserable dad his whole life? Doesn't he deserve a father that has his shit together without needing to be high or drunk to enjoy anything?I'm trying to enjoy life, I really am, but I just feel completely alone. Everyone depends on me and I make everyone happy, but I have no one I can depend on and no one makes me happy. Idk.The last couple months have been particularly bad. I really don't want to live. I know full week if I had a gun it would have been over by now. Idk. I haven't told anyone this yet either. No one knows.",1
"(i don't expect anyone to read this i just have to get it off my chest). i've been dissociating a lot. i sit in bed all day doing nothing, im wasting my life and it feels like there's nothing i can do to change it. every day i think ""maybe it'll get better, keep tryin God got u"" but it's starting to seem like he doesn't, I know he does I just don't feel it. i'm losing myself and the people around me due to the way i feel. i can't hold a simple conversation, im bland and don't want to be bothered. i just want to sit in bed all day and waste away until i die. i can't even stand going to school 5 days a week that's how lazy i am. i cut myself to feel something different(not that often tho). i don't like anything about myself or anything around me. I'm just so fucking pessimistic, full of hate, and mean for no reason, i just can't control it. i complain about everything, every time im engaging in a conversation, i just somehow end up on a negative topic speaking in a negative tone, i hate the way i act. i really just hate myself in general, inside and out. i'm actually fucking drained and i hate how people think just because im 14 that means that i can't be going through things, im actually in the verge of killing myself and try to mask it every day. if i feel this way at this age then it can only get worse overtime. if i were to kill myself right now there would be nobody that could say ""i've always had her back and tried to help her every step of the way, i cared so much about her"" absolutely nobody. im the only reason i haven't killed myself yet, there's nobody telling me to keep going and to hang in there but myself and i feel like it's because nobody gives a fuck; i don't play an important enough role in anybody's life so nobody cares about how i feel or what i go through. im always the last thought and the person people forget about or leave behind. i feel like if nobody gives a fuck about me then what difference would it make if i were to kill myself, eternal happiness and everybody free from me inconveniencing them. my mother would never have to worry about spending too much on me every again, sha'll never have to say she wishes she never had kids aga v nobody will be held back by me ever again. all it takes ... bullet, 1 bottle of ibuprofen, 1 rope, 1 river, 1 tall building, and everything will be fine",1

I recently separated from my husband have been seeing a nee guy for about a month now but if if wasn't for my 2 kids I feel like the world would be better off without me in it why should I keep going I sometimes wonder if even my kids would be better off without me in their lives the guy I've been seeing is not sure about things why should I bother ,1
"1) All the people who tell.i should live for them don't even want to talk to me and just try to avoid the conversation and shut me down every time I reach out to them.2) if it's so draining to talk to me or deal with them don't tell me that me ending it will make you ""feel upset""3) You can't live for other people you have to do it for yourself.Telling suicidal people to live for you and others while simultaneously shutting them down and shunning them invalidates the whole thing.",1
I knew a month before he broke up with me that he lost feelings for me. And that whole month I tried my best to change that. Every time I saw that he texted me I felt more fear than I‚Äôve ever felt. My stomach would drop when I saw that he texted me. It‚Äôs been 8 months since he broke up with me. I‚Äôm going through a big depression and I feel like I need to tell him how I feel. Should I? I don‚Äôt want to lose him as a friend. I know you might say I have to move on but moving on will be the death of me. So what should I do? Should I tell him? Will he understand or will he hate me ,1
"This past May, I tried to kill myself. I attemped to overdose and was found by two friends, then subsequently taken to the hospital. I'm an engineering student and the week of my attempt I had finals. While I was in the hospital with limited contact to the outside world, there were exams going on. Once I got out, I emailed my professors, telling them I had a medical emergency (didn't want to disclose the reason of my hospitilization), and basically begged to make up my exams. They all told me to basically reach out at the end of summer and take it when school started back up again. I tried to fix myself, started exercising, journaling, dieting, reading, less screentime, going to therapy, all that jazz. I honestly tried to speedrun it, try to make myself not depressed, so I could go back to school and pretend it was all okay again. I'm not someone that other people would think is depressed. I force myself to laugh and smile and not kill the vibe, even though I feel so incredibly hollow on the inside. I don't want people to know I'm depressed, it feels so shameful and embarrassing. So, I tried to fucking get over it in two months, I had a timeline and everything. I took my pills, I talked in therapy, etc. And I felt okay, for like a week.  I thought I was over it, that I healed, but when I went to type out an email to my professor about making up the exam since summer is drawing to a close, my hands started shaking and I began spiraling. I'm just thrusting myself back into the same stressful academic environment, same apartment I tried to end everything in, same everything, and I'm not even sure if I don't want to die. I still do, a huge part of me still does, bigger than I want to admit. I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell my friends, because they all expect me to be better, I can't tell my family, they also expect me to just be okay. Why can't I be okay? I wish there was a guide book on how to fix myself so I didn't have to have a panic attack or scratch myself when I think about going back to school, or the fact that I've failed to fix my brain. I still wish I died, I still hate existing, I don't know if it'll ever get better.",1
Not sure why im writing this. Going through a big breakup and it's hard to imagine my future. Even before the breakup I felt like my art doesn't matter or bring me joy anymore. I'm 33 with no real career or plan. The cost of living is higher and higher. When I think of the future I see nothing. I'm tried of working and still struggling. student debt and credit card debt on my tail always. And now this breakup.... I thought I was going to spend my life with this person and now I'm scrambling to find a place to live. The only thing keeping me from not killing myself is reading the horror stories here of peoples failed attempts. I would end it if I knew it was guaranteed to work. I don't know what to do,1
When I learned about Heaven's Gate I thought the aliens were stupid but the concept was still there. A whole group of people dying at once is way more impactful than one person by themselves. Back then I was only 15 but I was suicidal (I still am 13 years in a rowüìà) and had the idea to ask others in person if they were depressed. I wanted a group of us to die at my house. I wanted my house to be jam packed with people. Even people on the grass. I wanted our purpose to be about fighting domestic abuse and gangs. I was tired of being afraid inside my house and outside in my neighborhood. I had no safe place. Unfortunately nobody wanted to admit to being depressed. ,1
"i gave him five years, and put everything into building something together, for us. i was only nineteen and i showed him so much grace. i forgave abuse and dropped out of school twice just to start over after he‚Äôd hurt me. and i now forgave the cheating, because i am a fucking clown, worthless and unable to give myself minimum respect. god forbid i ever have children. i think thats what fucks with me the most ‚Äî i would have gone on to have children with him, and my children would have a terrible mommy, and i wouldn‚Äôt be able to protect them. so not only am i not contributing to the world, but am actively endangering it! and children are my purpose‚Äî i was only happy when i worked with children, and my volunteering and freelance work both include interacting with children. because children are pure and like my hair and sometimes even look up to me. and he ruined this for me. i lost everything. and not only did i lose it, i gave everything to him, and he destroyed it. so the ‚Äúeverything‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist anymore, it isn‚Äôt even stolen or kept elsewhere, it is wasted and destroyed and burned to the ground.and i trusted him to pick up my pieces after the affair and after i almost lost my life. why did this clown act so stupid yet again??? because there was nothing in me with any strength left to move on, so i decided to trust him one last time, because i am weak and broken. and he hurt me again. and if we ever had children, not only would they not be safe, but he would have abandoned them and me midst postpartum psychosis (which i would be prone to due to mental health stuff). and he still makes it my fault. this is too difficult for HIM. i am too broken after his affair so he should stab me in the back one last time? it isn‚Äôt enough that i almost died, that the whole academia hates me due to his rumors and manipulation, that i had to drop everything and everyone.i lost everything because of him. my sanity, friends, education, functionality, ability to exist. im only left with nightmares every single night, and i wake up in tears, being reminded how much of a waste i am, and how awful and harmful of a mother i would have been.i cannot do this anymore. i am twenty four and i am too broken and unwell to start over yet again. i always end up in the same dark place, and there‚Äôs no point to my disgusting existence where i continue to be the source of pain and suffering.

"Oof this is gonna be long i guess. If you make it all the way through thanks for your patience.So i have been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder which is actually causing my depression and anxiety. I had a violent upbringing parents fighting physically , father being an alcoholic and neglectful towards my mother. Abused her , tortured her but my mom hasnt divorced my father because idk maybe during my mom's 20s or during her struggles in the marriage or before the marriage made her weak and she is also really scared about society. Funny thing is my father doesnt even contribute anything for me or my mom. My mom has a govt job and we(me and mom) moved to a big city 2 years back for my college and also for her job and my fathers direct influence in stuff lessened but not that much. I always have had a very turbulent relationship with my mother. Its abusive and toxic at worst and comolicated at best. I hate myself for the fact that she's had to provide for me till now. I am 23 years old and female. I am actively looking for jobs but the environment or situation i am in its just not letting me prepare myself for that properly. I have always been a lonely and shy kid but also stubborn and set in my own ways. According to my mother i have also spoilt her life along with my father because of my behavioral issues or my actions. She describes me as a selfish spoilt brat who doesnt have any idea about how the world works and someone who just wants to rot in bed all day and play with her phone. To be honest i do understand her frustration. I had told her years back that she is facing a burnout and she needs help but since i dont have any practical idea about how stuff works whatever i say is always ignored. How my mom and her advisors like some of her relatives treat me i feel like i am my mothers dog if i dont act a certain way i am the worst possible person on earth. My mom or her council dont understand the severity of my problems and often devalue them and try to tell me how i am inconveniencing my mother by my behavior such as anger outburst, bed rotting, not willing to be social and many more. When i realized that they will never understand the severity or extent of my problems i kind of went back in a shell i have stopped hanging out with people close to my mom for the last 9 or so months, i avoid gatherings like that because i will be asked uncomfortable questions. All i am trying to say is even though my mom or her council together have tried to do something good for me thinking about me it only ended in me suffering for their decisons and my mom also blames me for that saying we have tried to do good by you but you couldn't take it. I am always the villain in her story , she has been talking to a lot of people about my recent change in behavior like not interacting with her being in my own shell and she mentioned if anyone else had a kid like me they would have committed suicide. I have a boyfriend of 5 years and thankfully he supports me emotionally. The thing is recently i suffered a loss..one night i was trying to play with the baby bugie bird my mother got..i took her out of her cage tried holding her gently as i had done that once before and she stood on my palm without squirming or anything..but she slipped through and flew so high so suddenly and before i could turn off the fan..she got hit..fell down..she died..i took her to the hospital but it was too late..i believe i killed her and i deserve whatever punishment there is..but her death kind of broke something in me...i kind of cried all night and the next morning givung myself a fucking headche. But after that all the patience, all the logical thinking I had that hey just few more months then you can move out  just went out the window...I am so fucking explosive right now that even the littlest things are getting the worst reaction from me..I am saying horrendous things about my mother about the relatives (they all actually did something in December last year that caused a major breakdown in me and since that I have been distancing myself from everyone involved). I am actively wishing death upon my mother..like I would be relived if she died I would actually be relieved...all my outbursts are draining all the life force from me and making me feel shittier...I can't think logically anymore I don't know how long this is going to stay with me..I am actually scared..my mother keeps saying people do all this stuff just before falling down from their high horse and such shit...I think I'm going crazy I think every day I am staying at home I am dying inside..I used to go to a doctor but my mother didn't like him because he was very straightforward and he agreed with me with the fact that my mother doesn't have the capability of helping me or understanding my problem as she compares my problem to others and how quickly they recovered..she once refused to give me meds saying I don't need that many meds..people who had more severe issues than me got better without those meds I am not trying hard enough..you know the ironic thing is she is in the health field a nurse actually...I am not like this I don't say nasty stuff about people like this I used to be analytical and soothe myself thinking yes they had their problems they never dealt with it and that is causing their behavior..but now I have turned into this bitter hateful person who is exploding when any kind of triggering thing is happening and blaming my mother her people saying horrible things like why the fuck won't you die verbally abusing my mother..I don't know I am scared for me for everything actually I feel like death I feel so nasty so disgusting and disgusted..I just I dont know what's going on anymore..I can't sleep I can't eat I can't study I can't relax I can't..I don't want to be this hateful bitter disgusted person..but whatever my mother is doing saying that is bringing out the worst in me..I do not recognize this person she doesn't feel like me I.. dont know..and fyi I can't move out on my own right now as i don't have a job yet and my boyfriend can't house me as he's in a different state and my family doesn't approve of my relationship as I met him on an anonymous app(bottled)..so if I leave and go stay with him my absolutely crazy family will come after him , his family his job and everything..I am just stuck and I am completely fucked I'm feeling fucked. Did anyone also got so violent or completely freaked out feeling like beating people up saying you will beat people up if they try to stop you from doing something but then you snapped back into your senses? I just i dont know  ",1

"It‚Äôs pointless. It doesnt mean I dont imagine what it‚Äôs like. Fantasizing. Yet I‚Äôm grossed out by it all the while. Separation of mind and body. People do things because genetic programming. Suicide goes against that. I want to die. Everything else is false. People are living in this insensible bubble. Reproducing, going to work, school. All of this pumps the machine. Energy for the circle of life. Creating memories and moments to make life bearable. Death is the ultimate form of making it bearable. An exit. Once I discovered this and at a very young age, the means of living became unbearable. A joke. Why live if I can just take the exit. I can avoid all of it. Emotions are not real. Placeholders to explain circumstances. I just want to take the exit more than anything. I don‚Äôt want to build. I don‚Äôt want to experience. I want total abyss. When I see a graveyard in a movie I feel ecstatic. Ecstatic might be the wrong word. I feel hopeful. Grateful that death exists. Jealous of those already dead. Wishing, longing, yearning to be dead. To reach the ultimate goal. The only sorrow I experience is for having a life. I wish I had not been born in the first place. I feel sorry for any life to exist. To suffer. To live a life of meaningless. Fossils show a lot of what I mean. Life once existed and now forgotten. Sum total of dust. Nothing. Empty. I wish I had never come into life. I look forward to exiting.",1
"Hi, im 18y old (F) and although i dont think somebody is ever gonna take a second to read about my stupid and pointlesss time in earth i just wanted to let it out. (english is not my first language)I am the middle child, i have a brother (10yrs older) and a sister (2yrs younger), my parents never liked each other, my mom basically just baby trapped tf out of my dad until breaking point.My parents often abused each other phsically, verbally and mentally, which me and my siblings witnessed and also suffered from. Me and my sister shared room w them so we often also had to witness them having sex which til today i cant be sure if was consentual or not.My dad also always walked around the house naked, which makes it impossible for me til today to find a man attractive or engage in intimacy because i always find that disgusting image popping in my head randomly.My mom had my brother very shortly after meeting my dad just to have him stay w her, which he did, when 10yrs later when she had me for whatever reason or however cause she said multiple times she didnt plan on it, she had my sister a year and some months after, she wanted to abort her but my dad didnt really like me that much (at 2yrs old) so he wanted a daughter.My mother was ALWAYS absolutely obsessed and protective over my brother even when he began sellings drugs at school, at age 15, she did all she could so he'd never get caught or be punished. My dad was ALWAYS absoutely obsessed w my sister because shes always been very outgoing, playfull and feminine, unlike me.I have always struggled w making friends, speaking w new people or expressing myself through words.My parents always found that upsetting cause they and my siblings are extremely outgoing and loud, that alone, made me less likable.I spent a lot of my childhood w my great grandmother which i would like to believe was way way way way better, and she was cause atleast she liked me around more than everybody else but me being shy never helped and a lot of the old ladies that she'd go to church w thought i was deaf cause i would hide behind my grandma when people spoke to me.Also as a child i was always a bit chubby, unlike my siblings and EVERYONE at school and at home would make sure i knew that, that only made me more ashamed of myself and aware of my existence.I didnt have friends in pre school, or until 6th grade at all, i was always the laughing stock for some reason, i was never invited to birthdays and i was the person people would laugh and say ew when i would say i liked someone.When i was 8 (4th grade) my brother who was 18 and previously had problems w selling and consuming drugs left the house w the girl she was dating, which opened the first visible hole at home. My parents couldn't pretend to stand each other anymore. My dad left. He would go there sometimes to see me and my sister and they would argue which led to my mom attempting to kill him 2 times by strangling him in front of us.Through all of this my mom has always liked to convince everyone she was a victim, which she still does.She threatened to kill herself and us, multiple times, which she never did cause she loves herself too much, she also attempted to kill us one time by leaving us alone in the house w the stove on.She always blamed me and my sister for her and my dad's downfall, and often made us lie to know where my dad was or would be so she could make the biggest scenes for everyone to see. When i was 10 my dad found a girlfriend so ofc my mom had to find someone too. As soon as that happened, she left me in the house of some friends she had, who had two sons younger than me and two grown men living in their house, which made everything so complicated cause i had my first period there, i was so shy i couldnt bring myself to eat and caught nits. Meanwhile my sister was in vacation w my dad and his gf. My first taste of real neglect.After a while my mom wanted to move in w her boyfriend we barely knew, i was entering 6th grade and i only had one friend. He had a son who was around 5 and he was the devil in person, we were 5 people living in a house w two rooms, extrmely claustrophobic. His son would often slap mines or my sister's butt, throw a middle finger or show his dick and never get grounded for it and we couldn't complain neither.My mom's boyfriend didnt want me or my sister to shower while him and his son were home, or have our clothes washed in the same machine as his. But again my sister would be helpful cause she was friends w his son, so a lot of times they'd go out hapilly like a family of 4 and leave me out/make fun of me. My mom also had the amazing idea to send us to our dad's house on weekends where my stepmom one time showed us a gun and threatened to kill my mom, and we slept in the couch whwere we could hear and see them have sex.W all this going on, i reproved that year, i was 12, my dad grounded me, took me to his house, spoke to a friend and put me working on a restaurant kitchen from 9 to 15h and 19h to 23h. Next year everything went the same.When i was 14, my friend, my only friend until then, attempted suicide by sliding her wrists, my mom found out cause she was going thru my messages, and that became the joke in the house, my stepfather told me to cut my wrists once cause i didnt want to spend time w them. My mom til this day says that was ""just a joke"".In that summer my mom and her bf separated cause my mom slaped his son, and he was so mad ab it. My mom, again, said it was all mine and my sister's fault. She stopped eating, working or feeding us, i learned ho to cook, i fed her, and my sister, i had to force her to shower and shed still get up and make a scene, attempted to break a glass at my feet and make fun of me when i hyperventilated which started to happen more often arround that time.In that school year covid started and my sister became a troubled one cause she was always speaking innapropriatly w older boys and always wanted to go out, she was always arguing w my mom, even when i was at online class, i tried to become closer to my mom so shed feel better. My sister ended up leaving for my fad's home one time cause my mom threatened to ""spank her"". I tried even harder to be there for my mom but it didnt matter cause she brang home her bf. I said i dint want him here cause i had to be locked in my room for them to do what they wanted. W time she started going to his house more and more and eventually left me at 15.I asked to have a dog cause i felt very lonely, and i did. In the 3 years i lived alone she would sometimes take me shopping for stuff to eat but alway reminding me ""she didnt have money"" even when i would see her time to time w new tattoos and clothes. She didnt buy me clothes either. I always had only one pair of pants, two tshirt and a jacket. She only went shopping for clothes w me once cause my parents were ripped in between to no repair. How'd i eat? My grandmother would give me food at her home cause i'd go there everyday for this 3 years to take care of her and help around the house. Last year it brcame impossible for me to do that cause i had to go there before and after school and i really couldnt, that branf me a lot of stress and i had to go through scary panic attack every night without knowing what it was, i would tell my mom ab it and shed think i was making a scene and never spent a night at home w me to help. It got so bad i couldnt eat and i stopped menstruating.I eventually went to the doctor and got anti depressants, i found a therapist that i couldnt pay but that man offered to follow me (ive been w him 2yrs) just sincerely out of pity. I am forever grateful, even though it is not regular cause i couldnt ask him for more, it was enought for me to feel like i had a responsible adult in my life, i felt a little better and i even made a friend, which i had know since 7th grade and became closer w time, her family also made me her own and invite me to their house and special holidays, i also couldnt be more thankful. I was brave enough to try and have a boyfriend. It was a complicated journey for the both of us cause we knew each other for a year but i never let him get close enough.We started dating around 2 months ago and it was really great, we visit monuments, museums, we share books and hed feed me when he came to stay w me on the weekends. All dificulties apart, it was as good as it could be but, a month ago, my mom decided she wanted to come live here again cause she was ""mad"" at her bf for whatever tf. I thought it could never be that bad. Boy, was i wrong.She bring her friend, her friend's boyfriend, her friends kids, my brother, his 2 kids and his wife (their both drug addicts) here. They leave their newbord and a 8yrs daughter which until now ive had 0 contact w for me to take care. My mom finds an empty fridge and instead of buying food, she bought alcohol. I have been trying to find a job for a year already and specially now but i cant. My mom has suggested several times for me to leave directly and indirectly, she yells at me for being asleep, yells at me for leaving her alne at the house, whines about not having money all the time, supresses my feelings and wants me to put my dog- who is 4yrs and a home dog, outside, in a vow of stairs just because.She's doing everything in her power to break me, she speaks wickedly about me to her friends that come here, makes fun of me w them, paints me as a really shitty ""teenager"" when i have done evrything i could in my power all this year to try and become someone, everytime that happened she would say that it was all her cause if she hadnt left me alone id never become so independent. Today she tells me im a child, arrogant, i do nothing and want me OUT.My country doesnt give jobs to pp my age, they give it to imigrants and free housing/housing projects. I have little money from little jobs i have done and she even wanted to take that from me to pay her car debt She is always sustaining debts and then wants to put things to my name to sustain more debt, which my dad also does. She is making my life a living hell i cant cry, sleep or exist in this house and my dog neither. I think i gave too many details already to be explaining our fights back to back but this all it is.I cant see further, i have no one, nowhere to go or a plan. I can only see death as an anwser but im too much of a scaridy cat to even do that? what if i fail? they'll forever make fun of me or ill be seriously injured and still be alive, idk what to do, im so sorry for all thhis, i hope nobody reads its cause its embarasing but i need a light",1
"I have no control over the flashbacks which are too easily fucking triggered 'cause this one damn number is EVERYWHERE as if it's still remotely relevant... I feel so goddamn hopeless in this world, especially as a transgender male... with the way shit has been going... what doesn't help is I feel constantly drunk but I don't drink... I'm unwell, but I don't know what's going on or how to sort it... I somewhat hope it finishes me... Every day is just constant overwhelm, no fucking break... and if I do catch a break (like today's sick day), it doesn't feel like anything... 'cause I'm just overwhelmed by what'll come next and what has happened in my past... I am unmedicated, ordered some breathalysers to try and work out if I am genuinely drunk without drinking or jus' losing my shit... but the thought of the next day each night makes me want to scream... I don't want another day... I want this to end... I want the flashbacks and the nightmares to stop... I want this pain to fuck off... I want my girlfriend to actually fucking understand... but everythin' always ends in a fight... I was stopped mid-attempt last night before I could actually do anything meaningful... which jus' makes me feel like a fuck up... nothin' has felt real for as long as I remember and it makes me feel like it jus' wouldn't make a difference if I died so why should I suffer more than I have already..? I don't need all that ""yeah this is real"" crap, everyone says that but it don't feel real... it all feels like some fever dream... a disconnected and segmented vision of agony... I give up. ",1
"I know these types of posts can be a real eye roller. Who am I to offer you support? I can't understand anything that you've went through, the pain that you've felt, and the burden that you carry daily. What use is it that an internet stranger is offering to listen to you? Those thoughts are understandable and I've had them many times myself. Truly, I just want to offer a non judgemental ear and extend a hand of friendship to anyone who may need it. Not because I feel like I have all the answers or that I can 'save' anyone, but because I've tried to take my life multiple times and I shudder remembering just how lonely and lost I felt. No one was there to throw me a life line and I felt like the only human in the world. I don't want anyone to feel like they have no one to talk to. I'm just a 22 year old trying to course through life but if you need someone, I'm here for you. I'm sorry for what you're feeling and the burden you carry. ",1

is 17 too young to end my life? i‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs not a big deal if a nobody died ill be on the news at most or who knows media might cover my death as an accident but how do you accidentally slit your face and throat then jump off a building? lol can‚Äôt wait,1

"Post was removed from r/Advice and they said I should repost here. I don‚Äôt really know where to start, I guess I‚Äôm typing this as I‚Äôm going to visit her in hospital is a good place. I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for about 4 months and for about 2 of those she has been talking a lot about how bad her mental health is and how she wants to end her life. I‚Äôve tried to do everything in my power to help her by taking her on trips, taking her to the doctors and just trying to prove that a happy life is possible. She is out of work and has been since we got together so I have paid and provided everything for her. She was prescribed anti-depressants which after the 1st week seemed to be helping a lot but she had a bad day and claimed that she was just faking being better. The last 2 weeks have been extremely tough and last night was the worst of it. She stayed round my house (I live with my parents for context) and waited until I fell asleep and then went to the bathroom to try and overdose, I woke up shortly after she left and noticed she was gone and found her but she said she had taken some pills already. I tried to call her an ambulance or to tell her mum but she wouldn‚Äôt let me, so I held and hugged her until around 4am when she managed to fall asleep. I had to be up at 6:30am for work and whilst I was at work it turned out she went to a park and took more in an attempt to end her life. She messaged her friend, who is out of the country, who behind her back called an ambulance (which I‚Äôm thankful for) and then my girlfriend called me and wanted me to stay on the phone until they showed up and then even when they were talking to her stay on the phone. This lasted about an hour as I was meant to be working. She was laughing and joking about it all and I was trying to be comforting but she was saying things like ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt I just end my life in peace.‚Äù I know she‚Äôs going through a tough time but she also knows how much this is affecting me so it felt like I was a bit of a joke to her.The ambulance showed up and are now taking her to the hospital which I‚Äôm on my way to, I had to leave work early to go and do this which was pretty hard to do.I guess that‚Äôs the back story, but the last month or so has really taken a toll on my mental health and I feel as if I have reached my breaking point. I constantly try to reassure her but she just shrugs it off. I try to get to the bottom of why she‚Äôs feeling the way she does and she just says ‚Äúeverything‚Äùthen I ask for more detail and she just says ‚Äúeverything‚Äù. If I didn‚Äôt push her into going to the doctors, which I took the day off work to go with her, she never would have gone. Other than the anti-depressants, she refuses to get any help saying ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt need or want help, her decision is made‚Äù. Her mum isn‚Äôt really supportive of her mental health and she says she just shouts at her when she tried to talk about it, which I really find hard to believe because her mum is lovely, and the friend she called today is an on and off friend so it all falls onto me, and I have my life and career and I‚Äôm not in any way a professional and I can‚Äôt be a carer 24/7. She said that I‚Äôm her only source of happiness but I don‚Äôt feel happy myself anymore. I truly feel I have tried absolutely everything I can to help her or push her in the right way but she just doesn‚Äôt seem to get better or want to get better and she just keeps telling me that she‚Äôs going to kill herself. It‚Äôs a horrible burden to bear and I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. My mental health is at an all time low and I feel extremely guilty for it because hers is even worse. I just don‚Äôt know what to do.TLDR: Girlfriend of 4 months is suicidal and trying to kill herself. Refuses to really get any help and everything falls onto me because she doesn‚Äôt have any other support. She says I‚Äôm the only source of her happiness but I‚Äôm no longer happy myself because of the stress it‚Äôs put on my mental health.",1
"As many people in this sub are, I'm tired of the idea that ""I want to die"" = there's something inherently wrong with you. As if death as a choice is never logical. But it is?? Obviously not always but sometimes it just is. I can come up with scenarios where a lot of people would agree. For example if you have a terminal illness, many people believe in your right to die. But if you're not dying already, your life apparently can't be worse than death...than nothing, which is what death would feel like, I think. The same way it felt like nothing before you were born.I feel like my knees were kicked out from under me and I'm unable to ever get up. I can't only have my mind in the past, I need to move forward blah blah. I can't move forward if I don't know why I was shoved prone like this in the first place. How dare you think that you're entitled to watch me crawl through the rest of my life ad infinitum. I'm so tired of working towards goals I don't want. I don't have any real goals and I never really have. I just await the end and hope/dream/wish that it comes sooner rather than later. I'm in my late 20s and my family members live a long time. I just sob thinking I could have another 60 years of this. As if this hasn't been bad enough.My mind tortures me, makes functioning nearly impossible. The arguing between the me that's 'me' and my mind ruins so many relationships, so many opportunities. My body is falling apart at the hinges and will only progress. Because I'm not visibly physically disabled, no one sees the cage I've been stuck in my entire life. My body. My brain. It's like keeping a German shepherd in a crate made for chihuahuas and I've spent every day screaming for someone to open the door. To let me out.And I don't want to die slowly and painfully all alone. I know it's selfish but I'd like to pass with the few people I care about able to squeeze my hand. I know it would only make their healing worse. I wouldn't actually ask for them to be there, but the idea of just...insult to injury. Suffer your whole life, have your hope crushed at every opportunity, believe it could be better only to watch the most important parts of your world burn around you, and then die alone.The only reason I haven't completed is my total belief in my own ineptitude.",1

I have accomplished nothing in my life, and I will never have a chance to, because the world is coming to an end. I will never get to be successful, never be able to share love with another person, never be able to feel happiness again.I wish my family didn't love me so i could go into the woods and just sit and waste away.

"Couple years ago I used to study in a residential school. I used to do pretty great back then. Our hostel warden organized these dinners where he invited students in groups because our school‚Äôs dinner was just bad. I thought it was pretty nice of him to organize these dinners. When it was our groups turn we went to his room, where he cooked and served all the students. When it was over most of them returned to their dorms and some stayed back in the teachers quarter. I blame my self completely for not returning to my dorm and staying in the teachers quarter. I was lying on a mattress preparing to sleep until the teacher asked if he could sleep beside me. As a 13 yr old boy I was so dumb to even let him sleep beside me. I thought he would just fall asleep but it never crossed my mind he would take advantage of me. I do not want to mention the details but yeah it traumatized me ever since. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve kept this a secret for so long. I acted as if nothing had happened that night. I had to attend his classes, see his face during briefings and what not. I also regret not sharing this to anyone cause it probably happened with other students too. Later on another kid who was braver than me confessed to other teachers and the school kicked him out. (He is still not arrested to save the school‚Äôs reputation) This has created a scar in me and I think I lost all my confidence in life. I want to do better in life but this trauma just doesn‚Äôt go away. Sometimes I feel like killing my self, because that memory just makes me feel weak and scared of everyone around me. I can‚Äôt speak with classmates properly and make new friends. It has affected me in such a way I cannot explain. I just wanna die at this point. There‚Äôs no motivation anymore to just wake up and face life.",1

"I'm typing all this out to explain the reasons on why I want to die. Hopefully after I'm dead someone could read this and know why. Throughout 7th-8th grade my life has really just been fucking shit. I was doing school online since from 4th-6th grade so just imagine being homeschooled for 4 years then just coming back to public school. Hell. The bullying was awful. I was the new kid who didn't know anything. I came in 2 months late so that didn't help. These are people who've been friends since 1st grade. Oh, and I was gay but closeted but my voice made it obvious. People made fun of me about everything. My voice, how dark my skin was, where my parents are from, my clothes. I mean the ego crush was wild. Then I eventually learned to just start acting like them. In every way. The bullying, racism, clothes. I started adjusting the way I talked and even walked. Just to stop the bullying. All it did was lessen it. Throughout 7th grade I had a fucking situation ship with one of my bullies so that was fun. And my mom was fucking ruining everything. My clothes and shoes were shit so I'd borrow my siblings (with permission) and she'd throw a fit. Why? No reason. She simply didn't want me to wear their stuff. No reason behind it. Whenever I did, she'd take my stuff and we'd get into massive arguments. One time she took a bunch of my clothes and shoes. I'm gonna just point out now that she is the main reason I want to kill myself right now but just keep in mind all of this is 2 years ago. By the end of 7th grade I already knew my mental health was shit, my mom was toxic, and I was depressed. But in summer school I made a best friend and buried all that shit down. As a result, I became toxic and a nasty bully throughout summer. A month before school starts I try to come out to one of my bsf friends (the guy) and he calls me a monster, and claims the devil took over my body. I said I was Bi bc I thought he'd get mad if I say I was gay. He says ""as long as you don't date a boy"". I tell him it was a joke 2 days later and he says ""thank god."" he had already told 2 people btw. Now for the rest of the summer I'm wondering if god thinks I'm a monster too for being gay. 8th grade comes and my friend becomes the toxic one. Constantly high, vaping, taking edibles. For my own sanity I try to help her. Never works out. That situationship is still going, I'm still closeted going to school with the most homophobic people I've met btw. My bsf is lying to me to get money to buy drugs, projecting insecurities, competing with me, and making my life worse. And my mom is still being her. As much as I'd like to go into detail about her, it'd take up too much space her and my time which isn't a whole lot right now. All this is happening while I'm desperately trying to improve my mental health. But the things that ruin your mental health are all around you every second of your day.  In winter break me and my mom get into a massive fight in which I bring up a bunch of trauma since I was fucking 5 (getting ran over by her bc she was arguing with my dad and what not). In which she ofc plays the victim as usual. She responds to all of this so maturely and takes my clothes, shoes, and phone. My siblings? They support her as usual. A reoccurring theme in all our fights. My mom did something really wrong but it's ok since its her and bc I did something slightly wrong. By 2nd semester I developed a fucking eating disorder to add on to all my shit. And I officially admitted I was depressed. But I bottled it all up and went to school every day. A few days before my birthday in April, my dad has a stroke and is put in the hospital. My mom stays there with him nearly everyday for the next 2 months. I continue on going to school everyday despite all my shit acting like I'm fine which is just fucking exhausting. My mom not being here as often is the only thing that made it all easier. By this time I was able to come out to my 2 friends. I passed the 8th grade. In June my dad dies. He fucking dies. The only person whose ever made me felt loved in my life fucking dies and leaves me with my mom. First thing my mom says to me after telling me he died is ""don't you go posting about this on your social media."" She's never asked me once to this day if I'm ok. She's never asked me once if I was ok throughout 7th grade. Throughout July she invites several strangers (her friends) to comfort her and forces us to greet each once with a smile on our face. We get into several fights throughout all of this. Now we're back to 3 days ago. I'm reading peacefully on my bed and my mom opens my door, looks around, takes my phone and laptop, and says to put those shoe laces in my shoes. I had just got several new shoes and clothes, finally had my phone AND laptop, and high school started in a few days. And my mom had to come and ruin it all. She's down the hall and I'm still in my room so I yell out of anger (but also so she can hear me) ""why did you have to take my devices"". She stomps back to my room says ""ok"" and takes the new shoes I got and says ""you're not getting these back or you're devices"". At that point I lose it. I fucking lose it all. I'm yelling, I'm screaming, I'm saying whatever comes to mind because I am just so done with her and everything about her. I'm done with the emotional, mental, and sometimes physical abuse. I'm calling her names, I'm cursing at her. She comes up to me and says, ""Just wait after your father's funeral (in december) just wait to see what I'll do to you"". She claims she says this bc ""When your husband dies you can't lash out"" but she has countless times since his death. All of this in less than 5 minutes. My home life was in shambles and soon my school life. The next day I'm trying to watch tv using a roku and she takes the fucking roku. So I connect the roku from downstairs to the one upstairs and she demands I take it back downstairs bc ""that's where it belongs"". My problem with this is, there is another tv downstairs my grandma uses which is always loud because she can't hear well. I can't use the tv down there bc the other one is way louder. Because that other tv is way louder, no one uses the other tv bc you can't here anything. To add on, one of the wires that the roku needs to work is on the brink of falling off. It was nearly impossible to bring it up stairs without it breaking but I did. And now I need to bring it downstairs. I try to explain all this to my mom but she literally says ""I don't care. Take it down or I'll take it. That's your punishment"". In my mind I'm thinking, punishment for what? But do I say anything? Nope. I try to bring it down. To no ones surprise, it breaks. The roku can't work now. I'm desperately trying to keep my cool and ask my mom, ""do you have another one?"" She has the fucking audacity to say ""I know you're not asking me that question"" in an angry voice. At that point I once again lose it. Bc no fucking way. And this now brings us to this morning. She demanding that I pick up a bunch of ant infested leaves after taking away my phone and laptop and being the reason I literally have nothing to do in the house. I cannot stress that enough, there is nothing else to do in the house. She wants me to sit in my room doing nothing as a ""punishment"" when I did nothing. So I refuse to do it and she loses her mind. Yelling at the top of her lungs hitting the wall. While I'm sitting there not saying a thing. She begins to take my clothes and my old shoes. 6 days before high school starts. At this point, if why I'm going to kill myself is not clear, let me make it explicitly clear. Throughout my life I am just hit with shit after shit fucking me up, even before 7th grade. Trauma after trauma, violence after violence. It's all fucking exhausting and I can't fucking take it anymore. And these problems don't come and go. They all stay and drag me down as I desperately try to walk and pull them along and I can't fucking let go of it because they cling to me every where I go trying to fucking suffocate me. It's endless battle of me fighting just to live my fucking life and to be happy and I'm so fucking done. I'm exhausted and I just can't anymore. I have no decent shoes or clothes so that's a whole other school year of bullying throughout 4 fucking different grades because of my mom. Just constant trauma because of her. My only options are to run away or just kill myself and be done with it. Running away amounts to nothing. I'm not dumb. The only thing really stopping me from wanting to kill myself is the fact that it amounts to nothing. I amount to nothing. Just another fucking lost cause because my mom decided to ruin everything. I don't get to live my fucking life because of situations I can't fucking control. My mom is threatening to send me to military school in Nigeria where it's illegal to be gay. It's a death penalty there. Honestly the only reason I'm really posting this is for myself, to sum it all up for me to read through every fucking reason. I tried thinking of at least 15 reasons to kill myself (like that one show) but only got to 10. Still not feeling the will to live. A part of me wants someone to persuade me not to die because I know there's so much more to life than all of this. Another part of me is just scared to die. But a huge part of me is just so fucking tired of it all.1:Ego Crush  2: Never ending cycle of hurt  3: Feeling completely fucking abandoned  4: No clothes or good shoes  5: Highschool would be shit  6: Fair weather friends  7: Constant homphobia  8: Dad is gone  9: Still no devices  10: The pain is fucking unbearable",1
my heart is getting heavier as the day and i don‚Äôt know how much longer i can go.the only thing stopping me is that i don‚Äôt want to be forgotten.everyone who means something to me is already drifting from me and forgetting me even when im alive so my death wouldn‚Äôt mean much and if it doesn‚Äôt mean much then i‚Äôll be completely forgotten,1

"I've been suicidal since I was 6. I've never really had people to go to when I've needed help, and even now it's weird wanting to go to the people I trust so much. I've been on meds for many years so I have alot to od on if needed, but I don't know if I have enough to end it. The only way I feel nice and can accept myself now is by letting other take control of me and let them do what they want. My partner and I are both asexual (I'm just a but more into every thing nice uhhh personal family reasons) and he even says I'm doing stuff that people in a more sex drived relationship would do. Not like I'm trying to do it with him, but he says I keep submitting myself to people with out realizing. I've sent some showy images to older people just to feel nice when they say I look good and stuff. Ive only ever had one person who would tell me to do things for them and have rules for me to do which was really nice since i felt useful. I made a promise ‚Äãwith my partner that I would never try to end it again but it's to hard not to. I'm just seeing if there's anyone who would have ideas to fix myself or atleast people who would make use of me so I stay longer? I don't know if that makes sense. I know it's a bad idea to offer myself to people but it feels like it's the only thing I'm good for.",1

"I‚Äôve always been suicidal, and I‚Äôve been attempting suicide since I was a kid, but as an adult my last attempt was when I was 19. For the past few years I‚Äôve been in what my therapist calls the ‚Äúgrey area‚Äù I want to die, I always want to die, I wouldn‚Äôt be upset if I were hit by a car, but I‚Äôm not going to actively kill my self. And when I become more colorfully suicidal, my therapist has me remind myself I can‚Äôt kill my self till my parents die, and their assets are settled (I‚Äôm the only child and they‚Äôre in their 70s so hopefully it wont be long). Once that is done I can reevaluate if I want to kill my self still, since I wouldn‚Äôt have anyone else left depending on me.  But recently the ‚Äústaying alive for your parents‚Äù thing isn‚Äôt quite cutting it. My mental health has already been teetering, But now After a breakup, a few revelations within myself, and a big ol rape that derailed my whole summer vacation, I don‚Äôt know If I can handle my brain anymore. I go to therapy atleast once a week since I‚Äôve been 5, More often since my recent rape. I also see my psychiatrist every 2-6 weeks, and take my medication daily. So I‚Äôve been trying. Ive made my checklist of things I need to get in order before I do kill myself. I want to leave no loose ends, and have everything paid for. I keep a running living will. I‚Äôve recently updated all my beneficiaries and emergency contacts and all that stuff. I‚Äôve even added certain people to have the ability to memorialize my Facebook when I do pass. And I‚Äôve created a great organized system for all my passwords, emails, social medias, so anything can be accessed, used or changed if needed. I also intend to leave a book I am writing that will explain anything the people left in my life have questions for.If I fully dedicate myself, It will probably take a year of getting everything settled and ready and finalized for the quickest and easiest passing, and setting up the easiest after life affairs so others don‚Äôt have to deal with it, or the mess It‚Äôs hard for me to fully comprehend that my life is significant. Because it‚Äôs not.  Anything I want in life, I‚Äôve never been able to have or accomplish. Whether that‚Äôs an education or a good relationship with healthy sex life. I don‚Äôt understand the point in life without sex, it‚Äôs genuinely like one of the few reasons I could live for, but what I want in a sex life isn‚Äôt what any one else wants.Currently the only thing I have that brings worth to my life is my job, since nothing else has worked out in my life. But im not needed, if anything I bet my co workers wouldn‚Äôt mind a break from my annoying self.  ",1

"I'll try to be short. Sorry if there are some cringe mistakes, not the first language, etc.My father always has been generally good person. He has been helping me to navigate the world since I was a kid. Introduced me to IT stuff, politics, religion, culture, solving life problems. So, my goal is to help him, not ""mind my own business bc it's his own life and his problems"" and wait till something fucked up happens.During last year he started spiralling (because of really shitty political situation and war). He became irritable. Sometimes if he talks about something emotional, he cries. Recently he started to share his suicidal thoughts (when it happens he drink, obviously). He expects something like the apocalypse (due to current geopolitical situation in the world). Started talking about religious things. Started to drink every day. He also neglects his health, doesn't go to any healthcare specialists. He says that he anyway eventually will die (sometimes he even says that all of us will die, I think he means the war, but idk, I didn't ask further), that his generation time has passed (ok boomer).At some point I told other relatives that we need to do something or it could be too late. We tried to talk to him, to stop him from drinking more, but he doesnt listen. He said that he doesn't like being sober. He doesn't want to go to any mental health professional. Although I have sent him info about volunteer psychologists (major financial problems), he always pretends he will ""look it up later"".Recently there was some incidents when he went home drunk as hell, couldn't speak or even move normally. We thought he had a stroke or some other shit. After such adventures he doesn't remember anything (or pretends that doesn't remember).I try to listen to his problems, to discuss his interests and latest news. To show him some positive news about science and technologies. It seems it all doesn't work, his worldview is still extremely grimdark and warped. I am really confused, because I don't know wtf should I do. I have never suffered with suicidal thoughts. I am not a therapist (I don't even finished college). I don't know how to handle extremely depressed person without professional help.  The reason he is still alive is he needs to support his family (including me). Maybe religion. He says he listens to music to overcome dark thoughts.TLDR: Depressed alcoholic father. Doesn't want to get professional health. Reasons: personal problems+political situation+war. Has suicidal thoughts. Neglects his health. Alcohol has already started to affect his health.I need advice, resources, anything. How can I help? Is it possible to do something?",1
"since school started getting hard, ive been emotionally beaten by my parents. i get that im not a great student, im not very bright, ive got aspergers syndrome, my life skills are practically non existent, and im a bit lost. but everytime i try to do better, my two faced parents manage to put me down again. the amount of times ive been called an embarrassment among my peer and family is uncountable. the only couple of things ive found peace in are volleyball, working out and nicotine. im only 17 and i already wish to be gone. this isnt the first time ive been in this situation, and after therapy a couple of years ago, i learnt to adapt to my low EQ, SQ and everything that disabled me. so much good has happened this year. but my parents just managed to put out the last flame that gave me the will to live. while these reasons may seem mild to some, i struggle to put my feelings down with words. it really is difficult. when you try to show your parents how much harder youve been trying and they laugh. it hurts when its your parents. its not like i can leave yet i dont have anywhere to go. im just stuck in a hole. i hate my parents and they hate me. my constant feuds with my parents have also pushed me away from religion. i dont like it anymore. eveyrthing my parents thought me about it never happened to me. im not going to mention the religion but its a good one, it just hasnt done justice for me. since birth the religion has been channeled to my head that leaving (while faking my beliief infront of my parents) has been very difficult. its a foreign landscape in that sense. to be honest, writing this out has definetly lifted a load off of my chest. but it hasnt been enough to chnage my mind whatsoever. the one thing my parents havent taken away from me is my nicotine addiction, because they are unaware of it, and i dont plan on stopping. its the only form of euphoria that i can reach at this point. my eyes are dry writing this after the tears that flowed before it. i feel so stupid about this but i know that i dont really have a life to live for. shit parents, shit grades and all my hobbies taken from me. thats really all i can say at this point....",1

She yells a lot, she isn't familiar with caring for others as she was raised in a rich family, and I have been putting up with her yelling, disatisfation over small things, over and over again.

I started therapy which I Believe is a direction in the right steps I haven‚Äôt found a solution for forgiving myself and the more I thought about it the more things from my past o remember im going to try and write everything down it makes me sad because im terrified of telling anyone these things but it all started when I was younger I watched porn with someone older then me and watched it actively for a really long time that same person also made a mistake and put my mouth around his part once which at the time I didn‚Äôt realize was bad I bite and laughed about it but now that I‚Äôm older I feel like I‚Äôve sparked from that that is the first part of my life I felt disgust the porn addiction got worse and I actively became more horny and masturbated daily I then had one of my first sexual experiences at a really young age maybe around 11 with a girl who was around 13 I remember touching her and her touching me leading to more experiences later on I that same age remember also rubbing against people younger who I shouldn‚Äôt have and they didn‚Äôt realize what I was doing but I feel so disgusting about it I later got older and at 14 I had another sexual experience I was in a pool with someone who was a little younger then me and we both did something but later that that I pushed her into giving me a handjob I feel guilty and really bad for her as I honestly don‚Äôt think she wanted to my porn addiction had also been getting worse around this time and I started watching disturbing porn with animals I feel like I knew what I was doing was wrong and it disgusted me every time but I would always go back until one day I tried it with an animal I felt so much guilt with myself I felt like I deserved to die I did this action 5 times before fully stopping but I still watched the videos for a little while longer and at 15 I lost my virginity to my at the time girlfriend which I don‚Äôt feel shame in but I also was very unhappy after a year and she would refuse to break up with me and one day in Cuba I cheated I with encouragement from other had sex with someone who was in there late 20s I felt awful after and I even told my friend after how bad I felt and that I felt raped I then when got back I couldn‚Äôt handle the guilt I felt I told her and I begged her to not hurt herself I later did things with the 20 year old 3 more times and I feel like I‚Äôm at fault because I was the one asking for it I would flirt and look at her but every time after I would feel so disgusting with myself and felt like I just did it because I wanted to orgasm At 16 I ended up committing the worst mistake of my life which I feel like I could never forgive myself for I purposely left the door open while changing while a 13 year old was outside I felt like I should have been able to control my impulse later she laid on my lap and i believe felt my erection I then went to the bathroom masturbated and came back I didn‚Äôt touch her I didn‚Äôt do anything to her besides that but I can‚Äôt I let my body take control of me like that I can‚Äôt believe I let that happen as I was older and should have had the control to stop myself I in no way am into younger people which is why it disgusts me so bad I feel so gross and disgusting and I honestly don‚Äôt know how to get rid of this feeling and I feel like it‚Äôs eating me away through these years I also was sending nudes online and sexting people for masturbation together it makes me feel so disgusting With myself I feel horrible with myself and what has taken these suppressed memories and anchored them is a situation that happened 3 days ago where I was on Facebook and I wrote to someone for a fishing rod and they responded in messenger so I opened messenger and there was a chat from 2020 and I opened it and masturbated to the videos after the orgasm I went up and looked at the start of the messages and the girl in the video was 14 I feel so awful I feel like a monster I know I didn‚Äôt hurt anyone but I feel so bad for my girlfriend because I couldn‚Äôt control my hormones and the fact that it was someone so young has been driving me insane I know it wasn‚Äôt on purpose but I was slowly forgetting my past and in these past 3 days I‚Äôve remembered everything and I can‚Äôt let it go I can‚Äôt burry it in me anymore I need help am i ever gonna be able to forgive myself ,1

This just happens so many fucking times and there is no relief. I have been through the ringer of false promises. This is NOT treatable. It's not. I'm sick of the lies. My depression is a terminal illness. No matter how many hosptials or therapist I go to, group therapy, whatever, no matter how many times or different ones I go to, I always end up in a worse spot actually. There is no healing.

"i thought for just a little bit that i was getting better, but I haven‚Äôt been. my mind is a hellscape for me, like a sick joke of me being happy and then immediately getting depressed after with no reason or explanation. i thought to myself that maybe, just maybe I should try to talk to my mom for once and ask her to help me get help. I thought it would be standard. However, it turned into her screaming at me about how being suicidal was selfish, her repeatedly screaming ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù and ‚Äúshut the fuck up‚Äù any time I tried to speak, and laughed at me while i cried and tried to apologize for even daring to speak to her. She had the gall to cry to me after and ‚Äúapologize‚Äù, which maybe she meant but i doubt it. Now she‚Äôs acting like everything is normal.

im finally leaving this world today. my life is ruined i never had a chance to be anything in this life. everything just sucks so much im going to overdose right now and hope i wake up dead. everyday i pray that i just wake up dead im so tired of everything. this world is unfair. i tried my best to make something out of my life but it's over. i'm 18 years old im a loser ill never make it out of my parents house i just can't do this anymore. nobody cares about me people only care for themselves. i really should've never been born this life is torture. nobody will ever hear from me again. i know ive said im going to kill myself for so long now but now is the time i go through with it. i feel that if i even kept going a little longer things would just get worse. i ruin everything for everyone. goodbye.,1

It all depends on if my husband wants to be with me or split. I had an emotional affair. I deserve death anyway and I don't want to live without him. I'll make sure to do it so he doesn't know.

"Something that holds me back from going for it is because I‚Äôm Christian and supposedly suicide is selfish somehow (I don‚Äôt feel like it is in my case at least, it could even be considered selfless in some ways?) Basically my point is we‚Äôre taught that you‚Äôll go to hell if you do it and that‚Äôs an obviously terrifying idea. But I just feel like it‚Äôs not fair to suffer on earth then bc you can‚Äôt handle it partially bc of the cards you were dealt which typically isn‚Äôt in your control, and choose to cut it short you‚Äôre cursed to suffer in hell for eternity, that‚Äôs so cruel. I also realize no one truly knows what happens after death/suicide but in case hell is a result of that then I lean towards wanting to play it safe. It just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me though and I kinda go back and forth with what I believe to be true bc I can‚Äôt imagine and understand God being so cruel since he‚Äôs supposed to be very loving and forgiving.This is just something I‚Äôve thought about for years and just wanted to vent ig since I can‚Äôt talk to ppl about this stuff irl.",1
"Nothing helps, not therapy, not meds, nothing. I feel like I'm beyond help. This year has been horrible, I've lost so much, and I feel like I ruined my life. I have nothing left.I want to attempt suicide but also I don't want to die, I just don't wanna be in pain anymore. I can't live like this, I can't function or do anything without being in mental anguish all the time. I feel like the only way I'll be able to get the help I need is if I attempt, and that's a coin toss between me being mildly hurt or losing my life, but it feels like I have no other options. The only other way involves me waiting 12 hours in a waiting room just to even have a mild conversation with a doctor.The place I plan on jumping from is a pretty low fall but also it might still be lethal and that scares me.

"Hello, I posted here over a year ago and since that time I got my first girlfriend, this has brought highs and lows upon me, this has destroyed my mental health a couple of times but she has built it back up again and just as I think it might get better from then, it comes crashing down. I think this one is the big one, my mental health has taken another dive, partially because of overthinking that I'm experiencing and a family member has also been diagnosed with cancer but in the early stages. Mine and my girlfriend's relationship began picking up again recently, however less than an hour ago it came down, she has a habit of bringing up things that I have done in the past that I'm not proud of, I have apologised for every single one of these things to everyone involved in my actions but mostly words. She just brought something up that I did, she has brought this specific thing up multiple times (about 3 or 4) and I feel worse every single time, this is added to the lack of communication between us for a short time is mentally destroying me and once again pushing me over my limit. I do not like to say ""I'm going to kill myself"" because there is no guarantee in anything, but I have no reason to stay and it seems like a painless way out for me, no more stress, worrying, overthinking and no more panicking, just peace. Despite being nearly 18, it seems like a have nothing left to go for, I want to end my life and plan on doing it soon. Thank you for reading.",1
"21F, nihilistic, atheistic, with persistent depressive disorder. After failing calculus two times, I decided to take a gap semester. I haven't been peforming well as an editor in a student publication I've been in, and I've been finding myself barely functioning outside of school. My s/o has checked out of our relationship of 10 months, to which I ended up begging him to stay. We're currently long-distance for a month and I planned to go back to uni on January next year where he and I can get back to physical contact. We're currently in no contact for the second time. The first one lasted for 5 days, this time I asked for 7 days. He's been overstimulated by me constantly professing my love towards him, to the point of just staying with me out of pity. He said he still stayed after the first no contact because he doesn't want to see me hurt and doesn't want me hurting myself further if he leaves, and I don't want him to feel trapped.College and life in general already destroyed me, but seeing this person walking away from me despite treating each other like best friends and a married couple is just the final blow to me. Now I need advice on how to remain alive as I don't have access to antidepressants since a month (I'm in somewhere rural). How can I get to continue loving myself after being so defeated? ",1

"I got diagnosed with MDD, Anxiety w ocd symptoms and PTSD. I have no friends. All the friends I had were either from highschool and I moved away from my home state anyways which means I haven‚Äôt seen my family in years nor do I have the money to get on a plane to see them. I don‚Äôt have the motivation to pour into my old hobbies nor the money to get into new ones I might enjoy. I hate every job I find myself working at. I have no dream job. I‚Äôm socially awkward to a disgusting degree. I find most social situations to feel like improv. Forced to act right in the moment. I always try to feel out other people‚Äôs personality and adjust to what they‚Äôd like so I‚Äôm always exhausted and anxious and disconnected from social interactions. I‚Äôm off medication because it was messing with my body. I get high everyday because I usually desire the feeling of happiness even if it‚Äôs not authentic. I spent a lot of my free time almost in pain at how mundane life is, how cruel and disgusting it is, how I‚Äôm always so vulnerable in new relationships platonic or otherwise and people can smell it on me. Which is why I have no friends now. I had a best friend who broke the worst boundaries someone can break so there goes years of friendship down the drain. I have a boyfriend but I don‚Äôt always want him to see how much I hate being alive so I‚Äôve stopped talking to him as much about my feelings. I feel trapped inside this life because I know that if I ended my own misery it would cause misery to the people I love, I guess I really just have my immediate family and my bf.

And I‚Äôm not lucky and I don‚Äôt think the cards I was given set me up for a good game but I‚Äôm forced to keep playing it even though I hardly enjoy it. And I don‚Äôt even have the energy to fix my face anymore. To not look completely dead or show my anger or my sadness. Which leads to problems at work. I‚Äôve given up on even trying to get people to like me I don‚Äôt talk to a soul. Even though I want to be liked. I feel so different. And so odd.

So recently, ive been on a pretty unstable ride of life. i was really bad months ago and was practically like everyone in this sub all the time for so long. id say im just a bit better now, though im feeling like i want to bring everyone happiness one day, want to burn myself alive the next. i have failed in school drastically and almost did suicide (secretly attempted and failed). but my family is rather supportive anyways and they believe in me! i even had maneged to tell my mom that im feeling suicidal a while ago.these days ive even managed to talk to a really good doctor in the hospital secretly about how im feeling. they gave me a file to privately fill at home about my depression. plus ive found a really good game about exactly how im feeling. and while all this did make me feel better, i felt so guilty afterwards.because while i have ambitions, i dont actually do anything. i kind of want to be a content creator with the hopes of making the internet atleast a bit better and friendly. because in my life, humanity honestly has been the only thing comforting me. the internet even with its consequences is such a wonder to me, same with humanity. so i want to make the people happier and a bit less lost in their life! id say everyone deserves feeling less desolate, and people need to learn to give their heart a break.but despite these dreams, i havent even recorded a first video for months. im honestly wondering if my ambitions are just lies i tell myself so i dont think about how pathetic and shameful i am. i feel like i wont be much impactful and known even when i try because im an idiot. so with that im just bouncing between feeling mentally burdened but grounded to breaking down into the point i feel like im having a heart attack.the feeling that my life is good but im still sad also made me hate myself alot. so many people would dream of conditions like this, yet im just wasting them because im pathetic and only dream and think without actually doing things yet.+very recently, ive started self harm again. i hit my arms and legs until they feel a bit hollow and crippled. ive actually tried to bend my arm over to break its bone. i have a want to start burning myself a little aswell. anyways, after doing a bit more talk and search on self harm i actually managed to calm my brain down a little more and feel a bit more sympathy to myself. although i still have a plan of suicide in my mind, i have just a slight more love towards myself.to feel a bit better ive gone to my mom to tell her that maybe my hate against myself isnt as reasonable as ive thought. while she was happy, ive said how some of my more private actions might further reinforce it. she questioned what those actions were, and eventually i told her how im hitting myself bluntly alot. didnt describe it any further or say anything else.while she did tell me how thats not good... she said she will do spiritual energy treatment on me because ive gotten trauma from my ancestors, since its not normal.when i tried to say how thats not the case, she said my ancestors had crippled limbs and how they werent satisfied with their jobs. and left it at that without and seconds doubts while i tried to say thats not it. all that struggle and anticipation of saying my habits and thats it.im just... god i dont know what to say. i love my mom and she loves me alot, and i wouldnt be alive to day without her. but like, geez... i feel like an idiot now. was i trying to finally explain my actions just so i can get an ego boost as i still do nothing? does my mental health matter to the world anyways as ive yet to provide it anything? i feel like even this post is something i made for attention, same with this sentence. just so i can feel better as i struggle through nothing other people face.anyways, sorry for the vent. probably gonna play games to try drawing away my thoughts. im kinda happy ive managed to atleast get out of the always bleak feelings many people have here on this sub and have a slimmer of faith, but ive yet to do something. just ideas alongside daydreams. i hope i can make people enjoy living and feel like they too are a wonder one day, otherwise im planning to eventually dunk bunch of alcohol on me and set it on fire. thank you for reading! remember to try loving yourself more, be proud you are still alive and have a nice day! \^\_\^",1
I want to kill myself but this ant is stopping me. Can someone please help me keep him? (Edit) I lost him. ,1
"I also talked to a psychologist on a mental health app that said he‚Äôs just specified in PTSD and couldn‚Äôt give me any advice or comfort about the situation I‚Äôm in. My life has been nothing but trauma.Sexually assaulted by a man at work that I used to like. Humiliated for it by him. No one believed me.Depressed for months. Crying for months. Endless tears. No money since I was the one laid off. Guess abusers always win, don‚Äôt they? Then as a cherry on top, my own abusive brother told me I remind him of our estranged father - I haven‚Äôt done anything to him, no. He simply ‚Äúdislikes my aura.‚Äù Maybe my aura isn‚Äôt inviting towards a piece of shit that‚Äôs called me a whore and abused me my whole life. I‚Äôm too damaged to pursue any new healthy relationships with men. My mother relishes in the fact that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Äù the problem. Both him and my mother seem to think so. My estranged father couldn‚Äôt give two shits about any of us. My neck itches from the rope. One of those sailing ropes. I actually bought it for my cat to make her a scratching post but she hated my small apartment and my abusive mother gets to have her. As well as a loving mother-son relationship and being an involved grandmother to my nephew who I‚Äôm not allowed to see because my brother hates my aura. They say life gets better. To just hold on. I‚Äôve been holding on for years. This year in particular. I‚Äôve slowly been dying on the inside and it‚Äôs like my own mother either couldn‚Äôt see it or chooses to not give a fuck. I‚Äôm almost 30 for reference - ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you have your own family? You‚Äôre old enough.‚Äù Cause like I said too damaged and these men ain‚Äôt shit. Real sick of being here. It‚Äôs been a curse. When I was 2 I drowned in a bathtub but was resurrected. I believe things ought to have their way and maybe I wasn‚Äôt mean to continue to be here but I am I guess. But at this rate not for long. ",1
"My therapy appointment was cancelled this week and im already on the edge. I just want everything to stop. I dont know how to tell anyone how im feeling. My mum will yell at me and go through my shit. She always ever made my mental health struggles about herself. i tried to tell my friends but they just say ""im sorry"". Right now i feel like i should just kill myself so i dont have to deal with my mum if she finds out im suicidal. If i kill myself now while she thinks im not depressed itll be more likely to work. I cant ask for help. My mum will find shit in my room she doesnt like. She will make me go to the hospital alone again. ",1
" My life has crumbled since and I don‚Äôt know how to exist without being burdened by what happened to me, and being a burden for anyone to know about it all.Since being assaulted I had to give up my job, I got a settlement and an NDA but I don't touch it. It's such dirty money. I don't want to know about it.I was so scared if anyone knew about it they'd think the money somehow made it worth it..It's been 2.5 years, I tried to go back to study and I failed miserably. I'm paralysed all day every day in bed. I'm so lonely, my relationship of 8 years imploded and found out since being assaulted he stopped making payments on our mortgage, he lied about paying bills, and then he ghosted me.The more time that goes on and the less I follow a quick recovery path of what everyone else expects, the more isolating it is.There's no amount of counselling that can undo what's been done to meI never wanted sympathy I wanted to be seen as a person but I don't know how to rebuild when l'm alone.I've lost everything and my life becomes more harder for anyone to understand and connect with and I hate that.I'm in counselling, psychologist, psychiatrist, but nothing fills the void or makes me feel safe, cared, heard and loved",1
"So I've got bipolar disorder, borderline personality disorder and may have some form of Antisocial personality disorder. Pile that on with me being bisexual and never finding someone to love me yet hear about it from other people. I've felt this way since my teen years. I know there's other people suffering way more than I am so I feel pretty crappy thinking about it. Last year I had planned to end it. Bought some sleeping pills and was about to take a large dose of them. But something stopped me. Not sure what. I got no plans now. Just not sure what I'm clinging on to",1
Telling people what you‚Äôre going to do doesn‚Äôt do anything. They just tell you to stop being a victim.,1
Just here to talk maay or mat not change my mind. Edit: sorry for worrying you guys my mother accepted my demand to go see a new doctor i hope I'll get better now. ,1
I wanna kill myself I want someone to talk to like I‚Äôm a real person and I want more storage on my phone because it‚Äôs the only thing that keeps me sane cause no one wants to talk to me irl,1

"The last few months  have been horrible, I've been on a down track for a few months already. First of all my school life got destroyed by my teachers, I fucking hate those bastards, now i will have to redo things just to prove myself, again. Then my life at home got worse and worse, both of my parents have medical problems due to their work, not so great that that it would put a danger to their life but big enough so that their day to day life is affected.And the thing that troubles me every single day is what I did to my girlfriend, a person to whom I had so much love for and with whom I imagined my whole life with, I broke the trust between us by doind what I did, and I'm afraid she will never forgive me. I hate myself, I hate how I look, I hate everything, I have only one friend but we don't talk that much anymore, I lost the only meaningful relationship of my life, and I can't take it anymore.I just want to end it all, but I don't know how, and I'm too afraid to do it. I don't have anything to look forward to. I feel so lost and sad and hurt.I hate myself. I hate how I can never speak about my problems to anyone without getting a look of disappointment or the look to ""shut up"".",1

"i‚Äôm 16F and have had a hard life, including being SA'd repeatedly from 3-8. mom is adopted, and we‚Äôve been shut out by our adoptive family. raised by my unstable and abusive adoptive aunt and bio mom who fight 24/7, and being the eldest, i have to comfort my sister whenever they do. i‚Äôve been sheltered to the point where i‚Äôve never been outside alone, and i never learned filipino, despite living in the philippines. as a result, i‚Äôm traumatized, developmentally stunted, lacking social skills and emotional intelligence, and my parents refuse to get me professional help.all that aside. i‚Äôm struggling deeply after breaking up with my ex 17M, who has bpd, and whose sister 20F always supports him, regardless of his actions. during the summer, my depression worsened due to being confined at home and my parents‚Äô constant fighting, which made me clingy and emotional with my boyfriend. this negatively impacted his mental health, leading to a breakdown and what i believe was a bpd episode known as splitting. despite understanding his reasons for wanting to end the relationship, i begged him to stay. his sister, who claimed to study psychology, intervened, invalidating my feelings and calling me selfish and weak for struggling with my mental health. my boyfriend remained silent during this confrontation.at the end, his sister told me they ""didn‚Äôt care if i lived or died"" and that ""he didn‚Äôt want me anymore, even if i got better"". she broke up with me on his behalf, and i was blocked on everything. he didn‚Äôt even say goodbye. he left me at my worst. no, he didn‚Äôt just leave. he kicked me when he knew i was down. and he didn't even have the balls to do it himself.so what the fuck did i do? i spiraled. i went batshit fucking crazy. i have never self-harmed before but i did it for the first time in the week after the breakup. i was starving myself, i felt fucking nauseous whenever i‚Äôd try to put anything in my mouth.then, i got in contact with his best friend. he became my best friend because he was funny and gay and we were similar. so i started venting all my frustrations to him, about his sister, about my ex, about my ex‚Äôs female friends whom i felt jealous of. he was supportive, and he would feed my delusions like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs so in love with you he‚Äôs just angry and in denial.‚Äù and i knew he was lying to me but it made me feel a bit better.long story short. my ex‚Äôs birthday was yesterday, i still loved him. i asked his best friend to send a heartfelt message from me. he received it and appreciated it, but then his best friend decided to tell him everything i had been venting to him since the breakup.got into a fight with my ex. he was telling me things like ‚Äúi got into a fight with my sister. i wanted to unblock you. i wanted to give you a second chance. i wanted us to get back together.‚Äù and shit like that. i was panicking but felt numb. i still feel numb. he cut me off again and his backstabber of a best friend blocked me.no idea why he thinks he could just waltz back into my life after letting his sister say all that to me when he knew i was fighting just to keep myself alive everyday.please help. i feel so fucking numb. school just started so on top of this, transitioning from a torturous household to a space full of people only worsened everything. i‚Äôm so overwhelmed. i‚Äôm so sick. i can‚Äôt eat. i don‚Äôt know who to go to. i hate everything. i hate myself. i'm highly impulsive. i'm afraid i'll do something i'll regret. please. he was my person. he came into my life, actually gave me hope and motivation to get better and i was getting better, and then he decided to just fuck me up all over again.i'm so tired. please. i don't want to leave my few remaining friends behind. but i'm so tired. so so tired. please. i still love him. i love him so much and i hate it. i don't wanna love him anymore. i don't wanna hurt anymkre. i don't wanna hurt myself anymkre. i don't wanna hurt him anymore. i don't wanna hurt anybody anymore. i'm so fukcing exhausted. please help. please",1

"I don‚Äôt what to do with myself. I really don‚Äôt have plans to k1ll myself (thank god) but these thoughts and feelings have been penetrating my mind more as of lately. My whole life I was always alone. When I had friends my friends would find other friends that would suit their needs and then I‚Äôm left behind. Just when I thought I found a stable friend group that I thought liked to spend time with me I‚Äôve just found out they‚Äôve been hanging out at least once a week without me.

"This is a different post to most of the ones here and I hope that's okay because I'm wanting to help provide some hope.Every one of us is hurting in some way- I'm not talking about humanity as a whole, I'm talking about us, on this subreddit. We feel the world has let us down. We were promised greatness in the future and instead we got a pile of garbage to work with while everyone around is living the dream and they look down on us like it would be better if we were dead- They may not say it, but they seem to think it.I think the thing that causes a lot of struggle is the pressure by society to have a relationship.It breaks my heart. Society literally acts like having a kid somehow makes you more valuable to society than someone who spent their whole life trying to be a good person and yet was given a bad hand in life.2 things that give me hope in this regard would normally be two stories that changed my life- Doctor Who and Liar Game.These stories have nothing to do with each other but both have inspired me in writing my own stories in that they have one rather complex thing in common- They both star a main character who goes through like with no romantic experiences, but they are fine with it. They go from place to place, trying to save as many people as possible and make things as best as they can be but are always faced with opposition. Almost everyone fights against them, either not caring about or not believing the existence of their moral cause. Yet despite all this opposition, they are able to overcome it and give it their all. They make some friends along the way, but they don't last. One after another, their allies leave and they are forced to confront new characters and start all over again, having to fight for their own cause with no one to vouch for them.It is a sad existence sometimes, but also one of the most powerful.There's a song in Back to the Future The Musical called ""For the Dreamers."" It makes me cry. The concept of the song is that we all know the famous people who changed the world- Which is why the song is dedicated to everyone who just didn't quite make it that far.Just about every single line is pure gold. ""But for every one that gets it right, thousands more keep up the fight."" It makes me cry because it's talking about us. About me, about you, about everyone who tries to make a difference.I don't know if my post is right for this subreddit. If it's not, I'm sorry, and I won't post anything like this here again, I promise. But if it's okay, even if it's pure cringe, I just want to have a toast for all of us. We may have not been given a fair chance. We may not be where we want to be in life. We may not know what we're supposed to do. But if we do leave this world one day and never got to do what we wanted- I want you to know that your efforts themselves will ripple out into the world and make a difference. I promise that. No matter what happens, we'll see each other on the other side and have an amazing time discussing all the things we went through together.It'll be okay everyone. I'm here for you and I appreciate that you've been here for me.Let's just try and make it to tomorrow. We got this.",1
"My current life isn't the worst or the best (kind of in-between) but some stuff has happened in my life before (which i will keep to myself mostly) but my most recent theories are the thoughts just randomly come to me because i'm not getting proper sleep and i'm left alone with my thoughts at night, maybe it's because i'm a furry (i have not admitted that to my parents), and most likely because personal stuff that has happened",1
"I‚Äôd say in the past when I was suicidal, it was more hysterical, like I still had a sliver of hope I just felt pain and desperation.This time feels a lot different, it‚Äôs almost calm in a way. I still feel sad, but I don‚Äôt feel anxious, I actually don‚Äôt feel any desperation for an out or for things to change. I‚Äôve actually come to acceptance. I no longer feel any delusion that my fate isn‚Äôt suicide. It‚Äôs a weird feeling, I‚Äôve never felt like this before. It‚Äôs that feeling of I lost, and the match is over, it‚Äôs set in stone. Nothing left to do other than prepare.The only thing is I just feel bad for what it might do to my friends and family. Not that I‚Äôm particularly important, but having gone through the suicide of both my father and a good friend, I know that it messes you up. But I guess that‚Äôs just the reality of it, there‚Äôs never going to be the perfect time to do it.",1

More and more I find myself feeling empty, hopeless, alone, and better off gone. Even the things I usually use to remind myself to stay for and be happy for aren‚Äôt working. I‚Äôm catching myself planning for my pets if I‚Äôm gone, putting together where I want my possessions to go, and everything.

Im so scared and I can‚Äôt even talk to anyone about it as it will affect me in a bad way if I do. My mom and sister are already tired of everything ive been going through and I don‚Äôt wanna bother them anymore, my friends and I went through a stressful time and we are distant and if I try to talk to then they are stressed and wont be able to afford to talk to me. Recently I found out I was groomed a year ago (not in any contact with that person) I didnt know it at the time but I went to therapy and we came to that conclusion. I was struggling with that but idk i dont really care about it anymore. And my ex gf and I just got out of a bad point in our lives and started which i thought we were doing well and healing but she doesn‚Äôt think so and now wants to be separated even though she loves me so she can fix her life without the stress of being together . I respect her decision I really so but im not sure if I can continue on. She is so strong and I love her and I was actually making steps at healing with her only to be let down.

"I made a new account for this, but there‚Äôs a lot to unpack here so let me get into it.I‚Äôve been suicidal since I was probably 10 years old, around there. I‚Äôm 14 now. That probably doesn‚Äôt seem like long compared to most people, but that‚Äôs just where I actively decided I wanted to die. I don‚Äôt remember a time at all where I‚Äôve actually wanted to live. The thing is, I am so tired already. I have a lack of meaning in life and I really wish I had a more valid reason to this other than that I‚Äôm just tired. For three days in a row now I literally woke up and then sobbed because I was alive. I‚Äôm in a lot of pain.My father is mentally abusive and I‚Äôm so heavily behind in education that my future doesn‚Äôt look good. I‚Äôve also been self harming for almost a year now and I‚Äôm 3 weeks clean at this moment in time. As I‚Äôm writing this, tonight was really hard and I almost relapsed. How do I stop this? I have a friend who knows I‚Äôm suicidal, sort of. I told her I would never actually do it, but that was a lie. I‚Äôve been making plans a lot recently before I snapped out of it and thought to myself that I should try and find a solution. I‚Äôve ever really only been close to my siblings and my mother. My siblings are 10+ years older than me. I‚Äôm worried they‚Äôll put me in a mental hospital. That is my worst fear by far, because I know how traumatizing this is. I don‚Äôt believe my brother would, but it‚Äôs rare that I‚Äôm actually around him(though I could arrange it if I really needed to). I yearn to love life, but I don‚Äôt wanna burden anyone. The friend who knows I‚Äôm suicidal, I‚Äôve been helping her through her struggles so much. And it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs never listened to me before, but I consciously try not to because I don‚Äôt wanna burden her. I don‚Äôt know if this is the correct thing to do.There is something in my soul absolutely begging for help, but I‚Äôm not sure how to get help. I genuinely don‚Äôt know why I should stick around. Sure it‚Äôll make others grieve, but I‚Äôm in so much pain that I can‚Äôt care about that anymore. Does it actually get better? If my life is this horrible already I just can‚Äôt imagine what adulthood will look like. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt know if I should tell anyone or keep my mouth shut but I need to do something because this is insufferable. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever reached out for help genuinely, rather than just venting. I really just don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt know how to get better because all I ever do is just distract myself, I can‚Äôt sit alone with my thoughts or else I go crazy. I used to be passively suicidal but now I genuinely want to. What would help me? What has made you not wanna kill yourself? Why are you still here? Because I can‚Äôt figure it out. I just feel like there‚Äôs nothing ahead of me.I‚Äôm really sorry if this broke any rules, I‚Äôm really desperate.",1
"Hi all. Bit nervous posting this. Never written a reddit post at all before actually but I could just really use a place to vent. Not sure how long this will be, please don‚Äôt force yourself to read. I appreciate this space as a void no matter the response. I‚Äôm 26(F) and feel terribly misunderstood and unseen by every person in my life. Last year, I was diagnosed with BPD, OCD, CPTSD, and Severe Major Depressive Disorder. I tried around 7-8 different Antidepressants and Mood Stabilizers over the course of 2023, but never found a good match. I even did the DNA testing to help me narrow down options, but still didn‚Äôt seem to help. I‚Äôve been in and out of therapy since I was a teenager (for self harm, and acting out, and some CSA that occurred when I was a child). Some of it has helped, some of it hasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been single since I was 19, after leaving a long term physically abusive relationship. I don‚Äôt want to go into too much detail about it, but it was really bad. I have not so much as held hands with another person since then. I struggle with making friends. At one point in my life, my agoraphobia was so bad that I did not leave my house outside of work or see anyone my own age for 2 years. Some things have improved over time, but some haven‚Äôt.I moved back in with my family recently, but they don‚Äôt want me here. I pay what they ask me to in rent, and provide fully for myself while I live here. But I struggle to work full time due to my mental health, and they see that as lazy. Despite seeing me struggle with mental health issues since I was a child, they do not take it seriously. They do not believe it. When I got my psych evaluation done, and brought home the paperwork, I told them about it and left it on the table in case they wanted to read it. They didn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre capable of understanding, and don‚Äôt think they care enough to attempt to.It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want to move out again, but I don‚Äôt want to live alone. I don‚Äôt date, as I mentioned, and living with friends was an option before but it‚Äôs highly unlikely anything like that would last long term, so I don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôm not wanted around. I argue with my parents constantly, the basis being that I‚Äôm not doing what I‚Äôm suppose to do in life. I‚Äôm not where they think I should be. I‚Äôm not who they envision me as. I feel like my self esteem, to my very core, is destroyed because of this.I cry very often, frequently alone, and feel sadness so deep in my core that it makes my body sore. I know some people have it so much worse, and I‚Äôm sorry if any of this sounds selfish or spoiled. It‚Äôs not my intent. This is just how I perceive my life, how I perceive myself, and I am miserable.In the times that it gets really bad, I know with certainty that I would try to commit if it wasn‚Äôt for one thing - my pets. They solely bring me comfort and they would be so sad if I was gone. I can‚Äôt bare to leave them. But when they inevitably pass, as all animals do, my reason to stay here will be gone. Part of me feels it is suffering, torturous, some sort of curse to continue on until then. Another part is trying to be grateful I even have a singular reason to stay, because I do love them very much. The companionship of my pets I am grateful for.That‚Äôs all I really have to say. I feel like I have explained as much as I can, and gotten it all out. Not sure if it makes much sense, but I tried. Can anyone else out there my age, or anyone who has been my age before, relate to this in any way? Has anyone dealt with similar struggles? ",1

"writing a suicide note makes me realise how incredibly weak and selfish i am but here we are. i‚Äôm 19, F, never thought i‚Äôd ever make it past the age of 16 at best and i‚Äôll be 20 in a few months which is absolutely crazy to me. everyday is such a struggle to push through and make it through each day with this never ending anxiety and void in my chest that only intensifies as time passes. i‚Äôm the elder sibling, my younger sister is dependent on me, my dad is dependent on me, which is why i‚Äôve forced myself to make it this far but the truth is, i can‚Äôt do it anymore. i have absolutely no goals in life, people think it‚Äôs because i‚Äôm lazy but how do i explain to others that someone who killed herself emotionally and mentally at the age of 15 never even imagined having a future so i never cared enough to plan it out. im not good at anything at all nor do i have any interests or passions, im either mediocre or below average in everything i do, don‚Äôt even get me started on my course and subjects, god school and college just reminds me of how much of a loser i am. a lot of my allegedly close friends ended up breaking my heart at some point and left me stranded when i needed them the most, friendship breakups hurt so fucking bad i can‚Äôt even explain it. i do have a boyfriend tho, i love him so fucking much he‚Äôs the only reason i haven‚Äôt completely lost my shit otherwise i‚Äôm 100% alone and i know i have him but it‚Äôs a huge deal to have just one person to talk to because i start feeling like such a burden, yk what if he just gets fed up of me being so negative constantly and talking about having thoughts of wanting to off myself every now and then, can‚Äôt imagine how it would seem on the receiving end. i love you so much baby, i love my little sister, i love my dad, im so sorry for being such a troubled and difficult person. summer break is about to end and the mere thought of going back to college makes my chest hurt even worse so i don‚Äôt know how long i can push myself for now, im sorry. - J",1

"Lately I've had this overwhelming feeling of disappointment, or boredom, or just apathy. I dont really know the right word for it, but it just makes life seem pointless. There is nothing entertaining to do. No adventures to go on. No passions. No motivation to achieve anything any normal person would consider an achievement. It's just so mundane.It really is such a waste to bother living, to put forth all the effort, when I could not care any less about anything happening in my life.What the hell do people live for? I really fail to understand what gives someone that feeling of purpose.I don't want a relationship, or a family, or a career. I don't want to travel to other countries. I don't want to make a meaningful contribution to society or science. I don't want to live in a house and grocery shop every week and go to work.I want to see a dragon or learn magic or go on an epic adventure. I want to do the things I read about in books. I want a life that isn't an option in the reality I'm forced to participate in. I want things that don't exist. And those things being so far from reality make real life feel like torture.

"Pretty much title. I have BPD and the main thing that triggers it is interpersonal relationships. Especially intimate ones. Basically all my emotions just become very strong and every single one negative or positive hits me hard. I get attached easily and when I love, I love really hard. This in and of itself can be a turnoff/red flag but I also just constantly watch for signs that someone is pulling away or about to abandon me and this makes me have meltdowns a lot. After a lot of therapy I‚Äôve learned not to make these meltdowns a problem for my romantic partners to fix and I have managed to keep these freak outs away from them successfully after realizing this but every aspect of my life is still just so difficult. Keeping a full time job is hard, relationships are beyond painful, even relationships with my own family can be volatile. I honestly feel inherently broken and like there is a piece of me missing. I use substances, food and other people to try and fill this void. But no amount of booze, food or love from others ever fills this bottomless pit inside me. This just makes me like a monster and a burden to the people in my life. I feel like the responsible option for me is to avoid being in relationships at all and to try and keep my human contact to a minimum to avoid hurting others. But I don‚Äôt want to live a life where I‚Äôm totally alone so then my thoughts start to revolve around the idea of maybe killing myself is the best option for me and everyone involved. My pain stops and I can‚Äôt hurt anyone else. I really do feel like an alien and BPD is so stigmatized that it makes me feel like a monster. I really just want what everyone else has (stable job, healthy romantic relationships, self esteem) but have an incredibly hard time achieving even one of them for an extended amount of time.Really kind of at the end of my rope here. This is a chronic mental health condition meaning I‚Äôm going to struggle with this more than likely my whole life and I really just don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm going to do that.

Once again im considering killing myself. Everyday i get more and more suicidal and it just keeps getting harder to go on these days.

"We are on a trip to Cali. I don't like trips but I go because my mom wants me to and to see her old friend whom I like. I am 15. On the way there I ask for food and she gets mad and says ""She just made lunch"" which is true so I shut up. However a few minutes later my brother asks the same thing and she agrees. That is annoying because she tends to be more lenient to him. Then when we get off the plane we go to a small bar and I try to go in for the sake of my family but I start crying and freaking out because it's too loud and crowded. My mom is reasonably frustrated and rolls her eyes at me and my dad is cursing and getting mad so I just go sit in the car and cry. My mom texts me and tries to convince me to come inside and also tell me that she did not roll her eyes. She always tries to defend herself when I am upset even if it isn't her fault. Then the rest of the entire day no one talks to me or asks me if I am okay. I am now mad because I feel like no one cares. The next day we have to go to a party. I hate parties but I have to go. I try super hard to be friendly but idk anyone there. My dad apologizes for being angry yesterday but my mom doesn't. She asks if I want to take a walk but I am too upset to move. She asks me tonight why I am so upset and she forces me to tell her and I do. She starts defending herself of course and I get upset and triggered because in the past she defended her actions for something but then later on admitted that she actually did do it. So we start yelling at each other and eventually I just get so pissed I flip her off and say she has a victim complex. We go to sleep after yelling insults at each other for hours. I wake up and I realize I overreacted and really hurt her feelings. I cannot redeem myself. I need to kill myself. I cannot believe I treated my mother so horrifically. I apologized a lot and am trying to treat her better. I need to kill myself. Everyone I have talked to has said I was in the wrong. I cant live with myself anymore. I have to kill myself.",1

"Ok, it's rare. My gf and I are living in another country due to my studies, which are close from the end. We had an argue few days before she would came here, and two days before her trip, she attempted suicide by a shot in chest, but for a miracle, she's ok after a month in a hospital. The thing is, she told me she had problems 4 days before the attempt, and she apologized for things that she was doing wrong, and she tried to explain me it was denial of her problems and she was looking for some mechanism of compensation, and I told her she should look for a man of her age who could give her dream life. She tried to explain me it wasn't about it, and I heard another people instead of my inner voice. In 4 days, she sent our photos, videos about how relationships mature over the time, and the day before the incident, she sent a photo of my medicines of boldness in a hope that I would accept her in the trip as my girlfriend again.   She was in the middle of nowhere, she shot herself to the heart, but her silicone saved her life. A month in hospital, some CTI, and her lungs now are entirely perfect. She's really grateful about being alive, caring her mental health, changing her life, dreaming about many things, and she even wants to be abroad with me. She has said I had been a great help in the hospital and she couldn't imagine how partner I could I.  Well, I now it was her responsability, but I feel like someone who had denied to help someone from an accident in the middle of highway. I was right about breaking up, but not listen to the person who asks for help, it's unnaceptable in my life. She thought she was alone in the world. I denied to help someone more fragile. And I think there's no way to fix it. The damage was done, and no positive action can supress it, it's similar to a man who had been a good husband for 20 years, and one day, he punchs her wife in the face, even it was a mistake, everything has a limit.  So, I think it would be justice to die.   The another themes, I've lived many good things, I traveled a lot, I had good girls, studied, had good friends from every place, so, I think I've reached many things, so, I don't have much more to live. My profesional life is stucked, I see no growth on it. It's like, I don't have much to do in this world. No anxienties or depression, my life goes normal as well.  In my last days, I just want to come back to my country, enjoy my lovely people, hug my pets, live some months happily with my girlfriend, make some of her dreams, like kid and marry, and then, pass away. My father died from suicide when I was a child, and I want to stay closer to him, we've not seen each other from a long time. I'm getting close to his age, and I wish I could replicate his death, but first, feel what my gf felt, 30 minutes of her lungs hit, the pain of her back, feel the bleed - she was in doubt she would shot in the second time or wait for help, but in this case, I would give the second shot in my head.

"I M28 experienced a traumatic event a couple of years ago when I was raped by two men in a violent manner. I managed to avoid facing the reality of what happened for about a year, but eventually, everything came crashing down, and my life has been a mess since then.I've been struggling with intimacy. The last time I was with a woman, she held my face to kiss me, and her touch triggered a flashback to that night. It felt so real that I reflexively pushed her away. I felt terrible because I was afraid I had hurt her, and I couldn't bring myself to explain what happened, so I left and ghosted her. Prior to this everything was going well and we both felt we were ready to take it to the next level. I did hurt her based on the last messages she sent me after ghosting her. I've been unable to sleep due to nightmares, and my long-standing issues with depression and anxiety have worsened.I'm in therapy, but I haven't been able to talk to my therapist about this incident. Sadly, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. In college, I was sexually assaulted by a friend‚Äôs cousin after I had blacked out and my roommates sent me to sleep it off. Despite having an erection and finishing, which she used to justify her actions, I felt dirty and ashamed. When I shared this with my friends, they dismissed it, celebrating it as a conquest, others didn‚Äôt believe me and my therapist downplayed the incident, he said it sounded ‚Äúlike a normal college party hook up‚Äù and that maybe we ‚Äúshould not call it sexual assault‚Äù which made me feel even worse.This recent assault was different; it was two men, and it was incredibly painful. Clearly, I did not learn my lesson. I can't seem to move past it. I feel like I let myself down for not defending myself and am consumed with guilt and shame. I contracted HSV2 from one of the men, and now I can't look at myself without feeling disgusted and worthless.Adding to my struggles, I recently suffered two traumatic brain injuries within a short span. Despite having access to great medical care and being financially comfortable, I feel weak and undeserving of the help I receive. I see so many people struggling with very little resources and I feel guilt for having more resources available, but not making any progress. I don‚Äôt deserve it. I let three people take advantage of me in the worst way possible.I'm in the process of buying a Glock. While I'm not afraid to die, I don't want to die yet. I had so many plans and goals, but I can't bear the pain of flashbacks, nightmares, and the symptoms of my TBIs along with depression and worsening anxiety. I also don't want to burden my family, especially my father, who I fear would be disappointed and might disown me if he found out what happened. He is a great father, but he is a bit closed minded and doesn‚Äôt believe men can be victims. I know that‚Äôs all kinds of wrong. I'm afraid no one will believe me, as was the case in college or believe me but change the narrative to fit their perspective.¬†I hate myself more each day, and I don't know how to cope with this growing self-loathing.I'm sorry if this message seems disjointed or if I've offended anyone. I support all consensual relationships between adults.¬†If anyone has advice or has been through something similar, please share how you managed to cope and move forward as suicide is my best option at the moment.¬†",1

So why the fuck should I even stay here because I can't look at another face that looks sad or depressed irl.",1
No matter what I do people always are smarter and more masculine and mogg me in every way shape and form. I‚Äôm literally invisible to women because there are literally so many other options. I wish I was more of a man. I hate being sensitive and emotional. I never express it in public but I express it all out on the internet. I am so fucking frustrated that no matter what I do I‚Äôm not good enough,1
But still I haven't gotten the courage to jump off a tall building why is that.,1
Barely anyone wished or remembered it..i dont even blame them. Im and irrelevant weirdo loser .. still it brings a wave of sadness that crushed me,1
"I can't stop my thoughts. It's too much in my head, ai don't wanna talk to anyone I don't wanna be heard. I just wanna disappear and die. I want to kill myself but I don't know how to it's a pain. I have tried punching my ugly face, hitting myself but I don't die. I want to be over with it. I don't have anyone and I don't want anyone. I just want to be out of this. I am starving myself I don't wanna eat because I don't wanna live. I need to die.",1
I did some terrible and evil things during my psychosis episodes and I don't know if I was in it or not during sometimes when I look back. I feel so ashamed and I wake up everyday feeling like I'm an evil person... I keep breaking down. The only good thing is no one was really affected but me... My brain keeps telling me its my fault and it doesn't go away. I feel evil... I feel the only way is to get rid of myself for what I did in my head... Everyday its a how could I? I can't live with myself...,1
I'm still a kid so not 18 yet and I just tried cutting for the first time and it hurt but it felt nice but I'm to scared for someone to realize. And I'm to scared to ask to go to a mental hospital because I heard it's awful,1
"I wanna die so bad, i just wanna escape everything, even if it does make me selfish. I don't know what to do anymore, it just seems like i'm getting worse everyday, no medications or therapy seems to help. I feel like i have no where to go, i'm on the verge of possibly being homeless and i don't think anyone will care. I just wanna end it, but i feel like i need to hold out until my bsf's birthday, even tho they'll probably be better off without me. I just wanted someone to talk to, but even that's asking for too much. I'm tired of crying and having constant panic attacks now, and i just dread going to sleep now since i don't wanna live through another day. I just wish i had some sort of support, there's only so much i could do to help myself and i just feel so broken and lost now",1
"About 20 minutes ago I learned that my friend of almost 8 years forgot what day my birthday is; it's August 3rd, she thought it was August 5th. This triggered something in me somehow. Not anger but despair, nothing feels real and deep down i have the sinking feeling that my life is over. There's no reason for me to be here, my brain is flatlining i can barely think. I have access to guns. She didn't do anything wrong even. I feel like such a fucking idiot because I know this isn't a big deal and she wasn't even that off but oh my God it feels like everything is done and falling down around me. I do nothing and am nothing because something in me is wrong and has been wrong since I was born and nothing that I can do will change that",1
Someone close to me told me to leave them all alone because I burden them with my problems. I can barely cope with my problems as is. I can‚Äôt take it much longer. If this is what life is then I can‚Äôt ,1
"I‚Äôm still young, 21, but I‚Äôve been suicidal since before I even knew what that feeling meant. When I was a little kid and still believed in God, I prayed he would take my soul in my sleep. The first time I was actively suicidal was when I was ~12 (I‚Äôm estimating, I have no timeframe of my life because it‚Äôs all such a blur). There‚Äôs been times things have been a little better, but I‚Äôve never been really happy with myself or my life. I really don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm built to make it in this world/society. My anxiety is so bad it stops me from doing so many things (my therapist thinks I‚Äôm neurodivergent). I have a degree but can‚Äôt even use it, I can‚Äôt attend a job interview because of panic attacks. So I work stupid little part-time jobs, because I also can‚Äôt seem to manage working full-time without burning myself out, becoming so depressed I can‚Äôt get out of bed to go to work. Now I‚Äôm sitting here alone. The one relationship in my life that gave me a glimmer of hope for my future isn‚Äôt going to work out. I don‚Äôt have any real friends because I don‚Äôt have the energy, and people find me weird/boring/annoying, even my own family. I could go on for days I think, but long story short, I don‚Äôt see a way out besides suicide at this point. I‚Äôm not planning on doing it now or even necessarily soon, I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about how I know it is how I will die someday, sooner or later. And I‚Äôve had this exact thought since I was a teen. I legitimately can‚Äôt picture myself making it far enough to die of natural causes or whatever. I cant picture myself living in the world as it exists today. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I don‚Äôt want to keep going, so badly I want to just. stop everything. I don‚Äôt even necessarily want to die, I just want to have a life worth living instead of all this shit I‚Äôve been left with. I try so hard - I‚Äôm on medication, I‚Äôm in therapy and EMDR right now, I try doing relaxing and fun things for myself, but nothing works to make me feel better. It all feels so artificial. At the end of the day, I think the logical conclusion is just that I will someday have to kill myself, it‚Äôs just about when. Right now I kinda really want to but idk. I just feel so weird. I can‚Äôt even describe it. Everything‚Äôs just wrong. My life has changed *so much* over the years, but my feelings haven‚Äôt. They say to hold on for things to change because you never know what your life will look like in x amount of time.. but things *have* changed, and they‚Äôve changed a lot! But the one consistent thing had been my suicidal ideation ",1
"I've experienced a life of downs mostly clinical and persistent depression. I feel completely alone in crowded rooms even when making those around me laugh. I'm constantly leaving my body behind to daydream about awful things whether it be loved ones getting hurt or reliving past moments. My steps feel like each one is made as an endless hourglass pours sand into my shoe while I watch it and wait to spontaneously disappear. I've only had one person in my life who's known me as much as I can be known and they had to go get better somewhere else. I know there's probably better things in the future. But my life is constant suffering (perceived at least) I was once so good at time management, being thoughtful and selfless. Remembering responsibilities and executing them. Having hobbys and friends and a relationship. Balancing all sorts of proverbial plates atop my head. But the only one left is a 50lb. Plate and I haven't been eating or working out so it's to heavy for me to lift atm.  I don't want to bother anyone with this, I'm going crazy I think. People try to make it better but they can't. I want a hug. I want to feel loved. I want someone to fill up my chest cavity with sunshine. No one can do that though. That's not their responsibility. I've tried to make it. I've stolen joy from people to fill up my woe but thats wrong and rude. I wish I wasn't such an ass. ",1
"people say they want me to stop cutting myself, but if i did, i would kill myself. i haven‚Äôt cut myself in so long, but i miss the numbness while doing it, and sharp sting a few minutes after. god i miss seeing the blade glide through my wrist, i miss the blood gliding down my forearm. i miss making little crosses on my thighs, and seeing the red dot where the two lines meet. i miss seeing myself bleed, because it was proving that i was a real human that had blood and feelings and felt real human pain. but now i can‚Äôt feel that and i just wanna cut myself again. i just wanna be able to wince in the middle of class as i rub my finger along my bumpy wrist.",1
"I met a friend on reddit. He killed himself, Today and even though we barely knew eachother i feel a pit in my stomach i can no longer share to him what i feel because he was the first person to let me talk to him and he wouldnt mind and we would have conversations together countless conversations that anyone would refuse to talk to me about becaue they're too sad. I feel bad for those that lost people to suicide like family, friends, people they knew. It hurts to see a stranger a friend u barely know die because of suicide i cant iamgine what it feels like for those who knew them for longer. This put me through even more of a depressive mood, i no longer wanna live. I hate my life even more and the more i live awful thoughts, things come. Im meant to kill myself in 1 and half a day and i will as scary as it is. I dont wanna put my family through grief like this, its unberable than any other, but i have to do this cause im suffering and i can no longer do this.",1
"Im a 15yo about to start my sophmore year, and ever since around 6th grade ive had suicidal thoughts. I have even planned out what im going to do, and how. Im waiting until im 18 to do it,im kind of using up my childhood years and after that im leaving. Ive made peace with my decision it even seems like its fate now. But one thing that sits wrong with me is what will my family/friend think. Ive never been close to many people, pretty much just my parents, cat, and best friend. I feel the worst for my parents, my mom tells me how she waited years to have me (im an only child) and how im her whole life. Ive read stories of parents and friends of suicide victims and they always break my heart. I dont know what to do I see this as my only way out but it hurts my soul in some way.",1
"i like to pretend that everything is okay and that i‚Äôm still myself, but i don‚Äôt even know who i am anymore. my sister is coming soon and she is usually armed and i am so scared that shes going to keep her guns in my room or somewhere accessible and i‚Äôll finally get the courage to just do it. i‚Äôve written so much as a way to vent my feelings but i‚Äôm so tired of writing the same things over and over again, i just want it to be over. the responsibility i feel towards my family and friends weakens by the day and i know that everyone hates me i know it. everyones growing up and im turning 20 and i cant think of anything better than staying young and dead, just a memory before my life every really started and a story that my future nieces and nephews will hear one day, not really knowing or caring who i was. i am not enough for anyone to really remember and im a terrible friend who impulsively does things, because whats the point. i dont want to grow old and i dont want to be here, all i will do is feel more unloved, unprioritized, and uglier the older i get. if i end it now then at least i‚Äôll still feel a semblance of who i used to be, if i was ever anything at all.",1
"I‚Äôve been depressed for 9 years since my girlfriend who cheated on my with my best friend who dad was the owner of the company I worked for and had an abortion because she didn‚Äôt want to find out who the father was. I refuse to even try to open up to someone else and date again. I‚Äôm buried in debt, I now work a highly labor intensive job in the heat, I live with my parents, I‚Äôm 35 with nothing to my name except my rusty old car from high school that sits in a barn at my grandparents house. My mom and stepdad just want me out of the house because they think I‚Äôm a loser for struggling with trying to make it through a day. I tried to shoot myself last year after an argument where my mom just wouldn‚Äôt stop standing over me and yelling at me for being a loser despite having a job and trying to be happy and paying my bills because I wasn‚Äôt working two jobs so I can get out of the house faster. Something came over me and i wasn‚Äôt in control of my body in that moment.  I just stood up walked into my room grabbed my shotgun, loaded it and sat on the back porch, put the barrel in my mouth and went to pull the trigger but something just wouldn‚Äôt let me. I grabbed the trigger fast and just didn‚Äôt give it enough pressure to go off. I couldn‚Äôt make my finger do it. I fired it in the air, threw it on the ground and went to my room that is basically a storage room with a bed and cried until I fell asleep. I slept the whole afternoon and night and was woke up and yelled at for how my suicide attempt made my mom feel. The past year I‚Äôve just been in a daze. I go to work, chain smoke cigarettes until I‚Äôm short of breath, go to sleep watching YouTube and do it over. I got fired from a job that I took a chance on that I thought would make me happy and if it worked out I could‚Äôve made 6 figures at and I was forbid to go back into the field I‚Äôve worked in the past 14 years because it‚Äôs commission and made to take a construction job in the heat in the summer and cold in the winter because it‚Äôs hourly and they let you work as much overtime as you‚Äôre willing to. Today was my first day. I almost passed out because I didn‚Äôt drink enough water, then got told we‚Äôre working Saturday and Sunday so I don‚Äôt even get a day off for two straight weeks. My life has become complete hell and I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt have control over my life because I believed that bullshit from high school where you should try things you like and you‚Äôll be successful. I tried so hard and just failed.

"Male 14, I have been in love with my childhood crush who is Female 13, we have been dating for the past 3 months, recently I started hearing rumours about her calling her a sl*t and stuff, i didn't care much about it because I loved her, I even told my mom about her, I told my mom I want to marry her but my mom told me that Christians shouldn't marry non christians (that girl is a Hindu) but I didn't listen to my mom's advice, last week on of the guys created a fake account and texted me saying that girl had several ex's before me (she told me she never dated anyone before) I was shocked but I still trusted her, that guy with the fake account started telling me how she was dating a muslim guy before and they had sex several times and recorded it, i didn't believe this because in India girls usually don't have sex before marriage, plus that guy said they did it 1 year ago which means she was 12 years old back then, i didn't believe him and I somehow managed to bring myself to ask my girlfriend about this, she denied it, she said she never hugged anyone before let alone have sex, yesterday at 11.am, two boys came up to me and asked me about her, i told them yea I know her she's my girlfriend, they started laughing at me and took me aside and showed me her video, she was having sex with a 15 year old guy, she did all the dirty stuff with him, my heart was shaking I feel down and i started crying so much, I couldn't control myself, they left, they sent me another video of her eating his ass, I started crying so much, i couldn't handle anything, the girl I loved cheated on me and hid the fact that she already had sex, i texted her,  I only said ‚Ä≥why‚Ä≥ and she started telling how this was 1 year ago and past doesn't matter, that's why she didn't tell me, i thought this was all a dream, I took a knife to cut my veins i couldn't handle this, she already lost her virginity at 12 yo and I saw the video and that guy he bullied me using that video, i thought to end it all, she said sorry, i couldn't do anything, i couldn't even use emojis while texting her, I just said ‚Ä≥I'm not angry at you, I don't hate you‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥jesus taught me to love, you're forgiven‚Ä≥ ‚Ä≥i don't hate you please leave me alone‚Ä≥ she responded that she can never forget me and wants to date me, I don't know what to do, i can never hate her, she is the only girl I loved, if I hate her Jesus will be sad at me, I'm not angry at her, but I'm unable to forget this, her past haunts me and I have been crying uncontrollably in my bathroom for hours, I'm getting scared, I just wanted to be loved by her, I don't know what to do now, someone just help me and give me some advice, I'll obey the advice please, i can't stop the suicidal thoughts I just wish I took my mom's advice earlier, please guys don't reject your parents advice please ",1

I just thought about trying again but I feel discussing for even thinking about food. The thought makes me feel sick. For context I'm usually the type of person to get like 3 helping on thanks giving, make an all you can eat buffet worth my money. I'm 215lbs on a good day but have hit about 200lbs recently.

"I've been struggling with so many problems lately. One of them being, that I am a 280-pound 16-year-old loner with a cannabis and sex addiction. I started smoking when I was 15, I guess I just don't like the idea of being sober anymore. I hate the way my body looks, I hate the way I look and the way I operate is just not me. I've considered suicide on multiple different occasions, but I could never bring myself to because of my family. I have an amazing little sister and an amazing little brother that I couldn't bare to lose. I love my siblings and my family, but it's so dysfunctional. I'm oddly different from the rest of my family, I grew up differently. I have friends in real life and online, but I don't reach out when I need help. I have a major lust problem on top of other things. Being obese and having a lust addiction is what pushes me over the edge. On May 24th of this year, I was going to take my own life with my grandfather's pistol. I thought that If I smoked enough I would be able to do it without thinking. Instead, smoking calmed me and made me change my mind that day. I can't take being this big anymore, I can't take this anymore. I have a food addiction that started when I was very young, around 6-10. I had another breakdown today. I want to kill myself, I hate what I enjoy, I love what I hate. it's a continuing cycle of delusion and I'm sick of it. I just want to live like a normal 16-year-old boy. No more hoodies in 90-degree weather. No more shirt pulling around my closest family members. No more accepting the fact that I'll kill myself someday and that'll be that. No more hogging down huge portions of food and saying, ""Oh well, I'm fat it's whatever."" No more acting all hard just to come home and cry myself to sleep. I just want to live like a normal human instead of being too lazy and unmotivated to do anything. I've tried to get therapy, I've tried to start going to a gym I didn't have money for. I have no job, I sit in my room, play games, and smoke all day. I don't feel like eating anymore, I hate the idea of food. I hate everything. All of this makes me miserable, depressed, and suicidal.  I'm only on here to get this off my chest and hopefully, someone or some people see this. Hopefully, I don't muster up the courage to off myself within the next couple of days. It feels like all I can do is just end it and it'll all go away. But I don't want to, because I'm only 16. ",1

"I currently have no one else to ask about this, so hopefully someone on this forum has some opinion/advice. I‚Äôve never posted anything like this before and I‚Äôm rarely online, so hopefully I‚Äôm doing this correctly. So my friend that I‚Äôve known for 8 years and we‚Äôve been roommates for eight years recently attempted suicide. Luckily, we caught him before he could act. Unfortunately, he also moved into his own house recently and now he is taking ‚Äúhis dog‚Äù to his house every evening. And then he drops her off here in the morning because I‚Äôm retired and he hast to go to his office job and she would be left alone in the house all day instead of being here with the other three dogs that she grew up with. She‚Äôs eight years old.  it‚Äôs his dog because he originally picked her out and has paid for her all these years so that‚Äôs how we designate which dogs belong to which of us. But because I‚Äôm retired and have been for five years, Sophie, the dog in question, and all the other dogs are with me 24 seven because I‚Äôm always out in the yard working or hanging around.  I‚Äôve had dogs for 40 years so it goes without saying I love dogs more than not just most people but any people! So the problem is he‚Äôs being irresponsible with her. He leaves the water in his kitchen where she‚Äôs afraid to walk on the floor to get it , she‚Äôs stuck in his living room all night while he‚Äôs doing other things in the rest of the house cause she‚Äôs afraid to leave the rug in the living room. This morning when he came to drop her off, he parked on the street and lets her out of the truck and she‚Äôs standing in the middle of the road  for like two minutes! I couldn‚Äôt do anything because I had just gotten out of the shower and I was butt naked and I couldn‚Äôt run out in the road and get her ‚Ä¶..anyway he‚Äôs being very irresponsible about her happiness and now her safety but I‚Äôm being told by everyone I‚Äôm not allowed to say anything to upset him because of his suicide attempt.

Everyday my first and most intrusive thought is ending it. I don‚Äôt have a weapon and don‚Äôt have the throwaway funds to get one. I know it‚Äôs not the only way, but it‚Äôs the only sure fire way I know I won‚Äôt survive. The last thing I want is to wake up in a hospital. I want to die. I‚Äôm not fit for life and I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm exhausted. I‚Äôm never going to be alright. I‚Äôm tired of fighting when it‚Äôs myself I‚Äôm fighting with.  ",1

"I am not currently in crisis, just starting with that to dissuade people from worrying about me. I am on here, unable to sleep and trying to help the members of this sub because I get it. However, I know that eventually, I will likely attempt again. I have ideation regularly. I am currently primary caretaker for my mother as she loses her sight due to macular degeneration. I must stay alive for now. I also have a beautiful little brat of a cat. I love him dearly. His name is Mouse. I say that because they are why I am still alive. Mom will likely not last much longer, with how things are going a decade at most, I'm guessing. I have already lost my dad, who I was primary caretaker for before he passed. I am now close to 30. I don't think, once my reasons to live have passed, I'll have the strength to keep pushing like I do now. However, I can keep pushing now. Whenever that time comes, I hope I can look back and say, ""I made it this far for them."" That is important to me.Find a reason to live for today. Tomorrow can wait.",1

"over the last 2 days i‚Äôve been contemplating if i should take my own life. my ex recently decided to cut me off and i felt like that was the cherry on top to feel this way. i have a bunch of other personal reasons to do it but this one hurt the most. we we‚Äôre together for a year and sadly our relationship was always very rocky. i commited a regretful mistake and while i tried everything in my power to make it up to him, nothing ever worked. i was not a saint in this situation either as i did and said things i shouldn‚Äôt have. at the time i felt like i was kicked down mentally that i became angry and lashed out. i was always so fustrated of the things being asked to me about someone i had cut out from my life prior to this relationship. i just keep thinking that while we tried the whole friendship thing i was always viewed as the bad guy because i was the one with feelings. i knew i had some bad habits but i was working on them. i felt like i was never really given a chance to improve or actually show that i‚Äôm not the person he knew in that relationship. everyone keeps telling me it‚Äôll get better but truthfully i know it won‚Äôt. i felt like this guy was the love of my life, my second half and i‚Äôm watching all of it fade away. i also keep thinking how i kept dreaming about just stabbing myself to finally be at peace. i‚Äôve been driving over the past 2 hours thinking if i should just go tonight. i would hate to live another day without my ex in the picture or not getting rid of this feeling i have inside me ",1
Like I really don't wanna exist here . I only have 2 options run away or die . Third one is live this life that I would absolutely hate every moment of it I am afraid to do it by myself Caz I would fail probably.

"A few nights ago I had some really strong rum like 40% it was a little less than half left , before I did that night, at that point I was already drinking 5% Smirnoff for weeks, like at 4/5 each night before bed then some times I‚Äôd just drink all day so by the time as I got this drink I was feeling like it would be nothing because I was feeling tolerant, and whiles drinking it and I drank the rest of the 40% straight from the bottle I was fine and I was even looking for more, by time as I went to bed though I felt like I had poisoning I had all the symptoms threw up every second had the runs barely could‚Äôve breathe like just taking short breathes couldn‚Äôt breathe and really was feeling out of it I felt I could‚Äôve fainted , my body was aching so bad , and just tried to see what I could do if I drank water it made me like so that‚Äôs what I did then I remembered that day I didn‚Äôt eat so on top of the drink I didn‚Äôt eat so I was really gone , the next day I was dealing with the symptoms all day felt like it would not stop, it has been a few days now things are better but my body still aches and my throat aches from the throwing up all that time and violently, I discovered that based on how much you drink and your tolerance alcohol can send you away whiles your unconscious like sleeping, I still feel these side effects and with my life and how it goes , I would be so happy if I can go in my sleep aside from a gun or anything else painless and quick sleep would be the best, I‚Äôm so done with everything I really am I want God to please put me to rest forever please God please , why did I have to live like this why does my mother hate me I want to go , and lay in Gods embrace I feel like it‚Äôs warm like a pillow, every time I think about him and my situation he‚Äôs the only person I can ever trust I know there would be no doubt that he would not want to ruin me , God is all loving, I want to feel his warmth, I know it feels amazing and I know you would feel heard and understood by him there‚Äôs no hope here but I can have hope following him, come for me God please come, I sometimes don‚Äôt understand why he leaves me , why bring me to you God instead.

I'm a shit friend. I cam't justify my own existence even to myself. I want to die. I can't exist like this. I can't fight like this. Idk what to do. I'm making this post just so I'm doing something just so maybe I'm a bit distracted from what I feel. I don't fucking want to exist anymore and I wish I'd just get up and kill myself somehow. I'm just fucking stuck dealing with my own bullshit. Why can't I just think like most people and not have problems like this shit.,1
"I, 17M, live with my aunt because my dad got addicted to Coke, which was pretty traumatizing. Then he got better and became an actual father figure in my life. I trusted him again. Then he betrayed my trust by spending my saved-up college fund on coke. I didn't get therapy the first time so I had to deal with it by myself. The second time he did this all the progress I made on my mental health down the drain. I started to cut myself after 4 years of not doing it. If that wasn't already bad, I told my mother how I was feeling, and she told me I couldn't kill myself because she would kill herself. My mental state has gotten to the point where my only reason to live is so she doesn't die. And before she said this, I would never harm anyone physically, but now I think it doesn't matter if she dies. I know that's super fucked up but I don't know how else to think.",1
"I had overdosed a couple weeks ago and survived. I did it because of my friends, the story is in another recent post here. I have people that love me and I feel selfish to do anything again so soon.

Therapy and psychology appointments aren‚Äôt working it seems. Neither is medication. I joke about getting a lobotomy, but I partially mean it. ",1
"Like the title says, I‚Äôm done. I‚Äôm done wasting my life of 44 years. It ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt get better‚Äù at least for me anyway. Ever since I can remember, I‚Äôve always felt like that I don‚Äôt belong in this world. I‚Äôve always felt ‚Äúweird‚Äù all the time. Finally after 37 years, I went to a psychiatrist who betrayed me by stuffing me with so much medication that it has turned me into an angry person. This psychiatrist is no longer practicing medicine because his practice was raided and he was arrested. This is now why I don‚Äôt trust mental health professionals anymore. It almost ruined my life. I had to go to rehab just to get head back straight. Flash forward to today, and my wife tells me this morning that everyone that I‚Äôm ‚Äúfriends‚Äù with thinks I‚Äôm an asshole. That was my breaking point. I‚Äôm going today to somewhere very secluded and shoot myself. I‚Äôve already purchased the gun and ammo. I don‚Äôt want anyone to find my body.

I have no friends. My family hates me. My ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù is only with me because we live together and doesn‚Äôt want to make my mental health worse. I don‚Äôt talk to anyone unless at work and it‚Äôs only meaningless conversations. I don‚Äôt feel safe anywhere. I don‚Äôt feel safe being alone but I don‚Äôt have anyone to be around. I hate myself. I just want this to end. And fast too. Of course since I told my doctors and whatnot that if I were to attempt again it would be pills and they gave me meds that you can‚Äôt overdose on (and if you can it‚Äôs not fatal). So that‚Äôs not an option. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Not to mention the fact that I will be homeless in 3 weeks when my lease ends and my ‚Äúgf‚Äù will inevitably break up with me. And I have nowhere to go. So why keep going? I JUST NEED TO DIE. RIGHT NOW. ,1

"Slowly coming to the realization that I will probably never get better. I don't have it in me to be happy. I am stuck as myself forever. I can't even imagine what a life that I would actually want to live would look like. I think it's because my depression has nothing to do with any external circumstance, it is simply my default state of being. Some people are just born wrong and I am one of those people. It almost feels like a relief to admit this to myself. Now maybe I don't have to experience all the pain and disappointment that comes with running yourself ragged trying to achieve the impossible. Instead of trying to be happy maybe now I can just focus on pain mitigation. Don't worry about me actually committing suicide or anything, I have loved ones and I need to be here for them. I'm just waiting out the clock. But I'm 26, and people in my family tend to live until a very old age. My grandma just had her 96th birthday and I visited her for it, then I got home and it hit me that if I make it to her age I have 70 years left to go. I just started sobbing, I couldn't stop.

"I really don't think I can do this anymore. I have achieved nothing in life and have mental issues that came from nowhere, I don't even have a reason for them or any real struggle in life.

I don't know if it's just my OCD or a guilt complex or whatever but the whole world seems dark and I can't distract myself and I feel like I've lost the only constant of myself, the only thing that I was proud of. I really don't think I deserve to be alive anymore, because being a good person was all I had and now it's gone.I can't take it anymore. Everything is so dark and I can't feel hope. I don't deserve anything good and I've ruined any chance I have of being a good person. It was the only thing I was proud of, and now I've lost any chance I have. I really don't know what to do, there seems to be only one way forward now because I think I've ruined any chance I have of being good.",1
I feel very suicidal from a situation that occurred yesterday. It‚Äôs a long story but this man I talked to on a dating app for a short time called me a derogatory slur out of no where only because I stopped responding to his messages for a few days. (I‚Äôm fem presenting gay male) and I‚Äôm pretty sure this individual is closeted gay or bisexual. I felt so angry and hurt in the moment I wanted to inflict the same on him so I snapped and called him a racial slur to retaliate. I know two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right and I feel bad for my actions when I could have just ignored it and blocked him. He texted me from another number after saying he‚Äôs going to ruin my life and find me and have his friends who live in my city find me too and basically threatening my life and safety and I just don‚Äôt see a way out of this. If I go to the police I will have to show that I also called someone a derogatory word after I was provoked I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a crime or anything but it‚Äôs embarrassing and I feel so awful about it. I have so much going for my in life and I feel like it may be ruined now and I feel helpless and want to end it all. ,1

I am trying my best to compensate for my UG course but to no avail. I cant get a job even with 8 months of experience, been unemployed since January, and I am fed up with constantly applying everywhere. I've been through a shit ton of interviews this year already. I had a torrid phase 1.5 years ago wherein I was a dickhead and pushed many friends away and I cant let go of guilt even with therapy. I am having a shitty year even this year with some deaths and a whole lot of academic and career related stress. My parents want me to join Uni by next year. I got a very high IELTS score (8.5) and I am appearing for the GRE to compensate for an average GPA and trying my best to land another job before uni.Simultaneously, worried about not landing a job after graduation and sending my family down a debt spiral. I dont even know what to do. I am a fucking loser, for all the good things i do, i would rather scroll endlessly on social media than try and pick up attainable life skills. Everyone has raced ahead and I seem to be stuck on autopilot unwilling to make something of myself. I try to stay strong and stay whimsical through adversity. But even then, I know one thing.

"Im a 20 year old male at the moment but when i was 18 i made a horrific mistake. At this point in time i dont have the courage to tell people the mistake i made because i am still too horrified about it even 2 years after. I have struggled with pretty severe OCD for about 5-6 years now. The mistake happened when i was in my room ruminating about the pretty serious problems i had been dealing with. I then had a compulsion to do something which i thought would help me completely stop worrying about this particular issue which is based around real event OCD. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel and end to this horrendous issue which i had been struggling with terribly for about 3 years at this point. I also had this image in my mind about running downstairs and giving my mum the biggest hug because my problems were over. I just saw pure happiness in the future and i could not wait any longer for that. I am not excusing my actions i am just telling you why i made this mistake. I also did not realise at the time i was doing something wrong. I was just excited about my problems ending.It took me a while to realise what i had done but when i did, it was horrendous. Over a span of a couple of months i was constantly crying, became suicidal, started cutting myself, i tried to strangle myself to the point i couldnt breathe. I also had to leave university because i was too unwell to carry on. When i was back home i started drinking a lot to get through the evening and to help forget the mistake. I also overdosed on tablets. I remember taking handfuls at a time and thinking ""i could die if i take anymore"" and then realising i didnt care if i did. I became very sick and vomited alot as a result. I was somehow able to push the thoughts away for a while but in the last month or so i have thought again about what i did and i am even more disgusted than the first time. I began self-harming again, and my suicidal thoughts have become even more intense. I have practiced and know how to perfectly tie a noose and i know where im going to do it. The only issue is i cannot die right now because my grandad has been in hospital for many months and does not seem like he is going to make it, so if my mum loses her son and dad at the same time, i hate to think what that would do to her. I had to call emergency services because i felt like i couldnt stay any longer. But that was a couple of weeks ago and i still panic every time i think about what i did. I'm just so sorry and i will never forgive myself.",1
I want to make a will because im going to kill myself this week. I'm tired of this mortal coil and being stuck in an endless loop of pain. Nothing will ever get better for me no matter how hard I try or change. Negativity follows me everywhere I go. I just want to make a will to make sure my money and possessions go to the family members and friends I want them to go to. How do I do this?,1

"I‚Äôm a 24M with a personality disorder and PTSD, and I‚Äôm really tired of it all. I have been carrying some weight for quite a while now, thanks to the deaths of a few of my friends, and some other matters with regards to my cousins and other extended family members. Around two years ago, I moved to London to pursue my masters and have struggled to hold down jobs. My first employer shut shop, I had to leave my second employer because my landlord sold his house and I had to relocate, making commute 2 hours long, just one way, and the job after that had me working 16 hour shifts for 5 days a week, for a monthly 1500 quid. I finally got another job where the advert said that I‚Äôll be receiving 13/hour, but turns out that they lied and they pay 7 (way below the national minimum). I‚Äôve quite the bit of financial burden at the moment (13k left in education loans and slightly over a 1000 in credit card debts). I‚Äôve a loving girlfriend of over 5 years who wants to get married within a year or two, and a sister who looks up to me. I‚Äôm aware that there are prone who would trade their lives with mine in a heartbeat, and that my problems may seem trivial to some. But I‚Äôm can‚Äôt see myself keep living like this. I feel like a disappointment to myself and I am no longer even able to hold conversations with my loved ones. I know that my situation will get better if I‚Äôm able to land a job with at least minimum wage, but even KFC rejected my job application. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm unskilled. I‚Äôm a man of many skills, but just unemployed. I don‚Äôt expect help. I‚Äôm just too weak to tell my loved ones that I‚Äôm giving up. So I‚Äôm dumping it all here. I love them with every bit of my being. But I can‚Äôt love myself. ",1

"But currently I am the most alone I have ever been. The only thing that holds me back is the fact I love my cats. I left my boyfriend last night. I spent ten years thinking he was my soul mate and maybe he was, but I fuck up everything. I didn‚Äôt even cry. It‚Äôs fucking sick. I feel like a sociopath. I feel like I deserved to be talked down to and maybe I deserved everything else too. Step on Me by the Cardigans made me cry but looking in the mirror has me numb. I have very few friends. I can‚Äôt socialize. I‚Äôm a broken girl. Like I said I won‚Äôt do anything. I‚Äôll probably drink myself to death or just wallow in self pity until something else falls apart. But I‚Äôll do it alone. ",1
"And, honestly, all I feel is relief and regret I didn't do it sooner. I don't want to die but I also don't want to settle for a life that isn't going to change. I put myself out there for decades; I exhausted every available avenue; it's not only statistically, but biologically impossible now. Given that, I'd rather be dead than just settle for who knows how many more years of this. My body, my choice, right? Well, this is my choice.I've tied up all my loose ends. Closed all accounts. No living family, no friends, no job, no possessions left. My body won't even be found and I'll die like I lived - alone. But at least it'll be in a peaceful place.",1
I hardly even know what to say. My suicidal ideation is usually very reactionary to things happening in my life when everything gets too overwhelming all at once. I was at that place again then my best friend attempted suicide last Friday and all I can feel is jealousy which sounds so fucked up to say. Seeing him cared for by so many people and me feeling so alone without any of the support he has. I don‚Äôt even know where I‚Äôm going with this. Nowhere I guess,1
"I went on a major destructive year drinking alcohol and managed to destroy everything. I lost my partner of 7 years, my apartment, my job, friends and family. I only have my father left and am struggling to pull my life back together as I have been depressed for years and even more so now. I stopped drinking 4+ months ago and attend and do service with AA regularly. My doctor put me on lexapro as my anxiety and depression made me quit my last job as my brain was just not working. On top of all this I have a pending criminal case that I may be sent away for. I am trying my best to be a good person and get on with my life but I really don't see the point. To me my future looks hopeless and just full of more misery. I go between trying to make the most of the day or planning my own suicide. I have tried therapy and continue to go. But I really feel there's no hope for me and I cannot win this fight. I want to try but it feels like iv tried before and always end up back in a deep dark pit of depression where I don't see the point in doing anything except ending my life. I think the only thing stopping me from ending my life is that my father would be very hurt by it. I think when he goes I will go if I can last that long. How can I live without any hope for the future? I try to be grateful for what I have left and try to live in the now but it's very hard with all that's happened and is due to happen. Pure misery.",1

I spend all the remainder of the time where I'm not helping my mom on my bed. I rarely shower, almost never brush my teeth, forget to take my medication often (not that it helps when I do), struggle with feeding myself (I have to leave my room to do it and there's usually only one or two things I'll eat), and I wear the same three or four shirts every day that haven't been washed in months.

"I've been unemployed for a year now, terrible luck with jobs and my depression is kicking back in. I'm not attractive, never had a relationship and being trans makes it so much more difficult to achieve those things. Being unemployed means I cannot afford private care for hormones because the NHS sucks and I've been waiting for 4 years for that. I recently did a course to try improve my chances of employment but I have to have had a valid full driving license for at least 12 months before applying to any jobs in the field so it is ultimately useless for a long while. It temporarily gave me a small amount of hope but just for the lack of driving to fuck me over.I'm stuck in this house because I cannot afford to move out.

"I‚Äôm a 32 year old, good looking Asian guy but no matter what I do, I can‚Äôt get someone to truly love me. I‚Äôve had similar issues with my work career, with people telling me that I‚Äôm shit, that I‚Äôm replaceable, that I‚Äôm not worth anything, but I‚Äôve really come back from that and succeeded in my field through sheer hard work (not talent). I‚Äôve proven to myself and other people that I am the best, I‚Äôve become one of the world experts in the 3D printing sub technologies. But despite these things, the self growth I‚Äôve made, I‚Äôve discovered I can‚Äôt be loved. I‚Äôve worked on my romantic and career life concurrently, but the romantic side doesn‚Äôt reward hard work. Instead it values stupid things like ‚Äúlove at first sight‚Äù and a ‚Äúspark‚Äù or whatever bullshit. And it‚Äôs fine. But it also means I‚Äôm done with life. I do not care about work. I don‚Äôt care to earn any money when it means hearing my coworkers talk about all the fun trips that they will be doing with their significant other which I never will be able to do. I don‚Äôt care about my hobbies. They are fulfilling for the few moments that I do it, but afterward I still go home to an empty house. I‚Äôm so horrifically bored being alone night after night, going to countless concerts/festivals/events alone.I don‚Äôt want to keep living.

Well it shatters me to go through every day and see others easily get what I ask for/need. It‚Äôs just not nice to myself anymore.

I‚Äôve  become skilled at my hobbies (I hold assistant instructor scuba diving certifications and am a skilled woodworker and skilled spearfisherman) and have a good career and I did all these things on my own with mental struggles, as shown here.

I‚Äôm just crying out so hard to be loved and yet I‚Äôm just like a little dog that keeps getting it‚Äôs face smashed in. I‚Äôm trying to be confident and optimistic but I‚Äôm completely out of energy to lift up the shield. I‚Äôm not getting any refill and I‚Äôm so tired.

I can't stand any more parking lots or short lawns that are practically the same thing. I've been trying so hard to find somewhere to be in inpatient that wont just make me feel worse, or make me feel like i've gone from a concrete box to a white tile box, just to go back to the concrete box all over again. I only have two friends. One can coax me to hang out sometimes (god bless them and their patience) but usually I only interact with people through video games. I feel disgusting and pathetic. A ""good"" day for me is one where I brush my teeth, shower, take my meds and eat all in one day. And those are rare. I don't HAVE a situation to escape from or to run from. I AM the situation. I am miserable even when it's just me, and my blankets and a bed. I just want a mom. I just want to be able to afford one of those nice inpatient places in the middle of some mountains where I can feel like everything around me isn't dead and i'm not dead but I cant afford it. I'm very particular and ""fragile"", I guess. There is a very fine line between things that help me and things that hurt me and I cant afford the delicate things that will take enough care to not hurt me and make things worse. Im odd and peculiar, and currently i'm like a odd and peculiar difficult-to-care-for house plant who's being stuck into a crack in some concrete and left alone. I feel like a fish who's already been gutted and filleted, but i'm expected to just swim away and feel lucky to have been thrown back at all. I can't do this, I can't live, I cant understand the world around me or fill any niche inside of it. I am nineteen and I cant handle jobs I am not loveable enough to be picked up and gently fixed and beared with. I constantly dream of taking some blankets and stuff deep into the woods, (I dont want to make anyone in my house see my dead body) writing everyone I know a note, calling the police just to let them know where my body will be, and then curling up on the ground and shooting myself from under the comfort of my bedding and my favorite stuffed animal. And when I do I hope i'm wrong about my atheism and I hope in my afterlife I am very small and I hope everyone has their own version of God and I hope mine is a mother who brushes my hair and rocks me every morning in a garden everyone else thinks is overgrown but we both know is not. I can't cope with myself and that wont change no matter where I go. My general wellfare requires more sympathy than I could pull out of this earth even if i went outside and started pulling out clumps of grass and dirt with my hands. I want to die I fantasize about it every day. Im sorry if this is all weird and melodramatic. I just have nowhere else to type this out. ",1
"I apologize in advance for the long post. I'm not really sure where to start, but I guess I'll start with the fact that I've been inpatient 6 times so far  as none of these times have helped me in the long run (obviously lol). I'm still relatively as bad as I was, if not worse than when I started.  I don't want to go back inpatient for a multitude of reasons, the main one (although it feels stupid) being that I can't take meds very well. I've tried so many times, been through so many different meds to the point that my doctor has started at square one and is retrying old meds that I've already taken. Part of the issue is probably, as stated previously is that I can't take them, I physically and mentally struggle to take them, I can barely swallow them no matter how small they are and while trying to take them, and after the fact I break down and just cry almost every time because of the trauma (?) that I have with it (parents yelling at me saying that I just need to swallow it and that I'll have to learn how to take them eventually). Anyway, onto a fraction of why I want to end it. Thus far I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic features as well as ptsd, I've been dealing with the majority of this since about 6th grade (im currently 19, almost 20) . I've been through so much shit and been on both ends of being hurt/hurting people.  It's been years and nothing is sticking, even if I get ‚Äúbetter‚Äù for a little while it always comes back. Ive dealt with self harm and suicidal thoughts for the same amount of time the longest ive ever been clean was about five and a half months. I've lived both with my mom and my dad full time and neither option was good both made it worse. Currently I live with my mom and it's a bit much to say the least. At one point recently she was yelling at me almost everyday for stupid shit whether it be something I did, something I didn't do, or something I did that she thought I didn't do. I am currently out of a job but when I did have a job I was working part time because I'm supposed to be starting college soon and I wasn't even making $200 a month yet she expected me to pay her almost $250 a month plus me having to buy my own food, buy everything for my animals (i have a dog and a cat, the cat is on special food that costs almost $100 for a 16 lb bag) buying all of my own food, paying any bills that my health insurance doesn't cover, paying for my own phone as well as anything else I need/want. Anyway, I've got about a week, give or take depending on when I finish the notes, if I even decide to finish them at this point.  Feels like I don't really have any other options than to just end it. Anyway, sorry for the yap session if you made it this far, thank you for reading &lt;3 ",1
Why is purchasing a gun a process? I‚Äôm ready to obtain the firearm and leave this world. ,1
Im so lost in life and just find myself falling  behind in life im in debt up to my ass and i have to pretend everyday that everything is okay i blame myself entirely for all of the stupid situations i put myself in and continue to do and I just never learn from them i serve no purpose and this is probably the year that I call it quits ,1
"The reasons I'm suicidal aren't important right now. I have a nice cocktail of drugs and alcohol that will almost certainly kill me and a rope tied such that I can put my head through and my own body weight will strangle me just in case. The problem is, it's terrible timing. My little brother's boyfriend is giving birth and it would suck if they got back home to find me dead, on the day their son was born. So, the obvious answer is to not kill myself. But I honestly don't know how I'm going to get through the next 24 hours. The urge to kill myself is very intense and I am struggling to resist it. I talked to a friend (about other things, not suicide) and I'm a bit calmer now, but the urge is still there enough that I'm at serious risk of killing myself tonight. I thought of calling a helpline but they will probably send cops to take me to a hospital, which might be what's best, just to physically keep me from ending it, because my willpower might not be enough. ...But I also have a final paper (that I actually want to write) due next Tuesday (in 8 days) and a trip to a convention I really want to go to (and plane &amp; convention tickets were expensive) starting on the same day. So, if I go into a psych ward, even if I put in my 3 day notice immediately, I would likely have to ask my professor for an extension, and might have to spend precious convention time writing an essay, or just fail the class, which would suck. If I don't go, I might die, which...I can't say it would also suck, because it sounds pretty good and I won't care about not doing xyz if I'm dead, but it would suck for other people, especially my dogs.TLDR: I know there are ways to survive suicidality even when your urges are much stronger than you are, namely by making suicide impossible, or at least very difficult. But those are logistically difficult at the moment, and I'm trying to decide whether to chance it on my struggling self-restraint or just call a helpline or go to an ER. If anyone has advice, tips, or other solutions (except dying), please comment. What should I do?",1
"I really want to die. But I live in constant fear of failing my friends and family. I don't want them to feel like it's their fault and I don't want them to think that I left because I don't love them. I've been suffering secretly for years and I just want to end it off, but like I said, I can't bare the thoughts of my friends, family and partner's lives being ruined it because of my selfish act. I don't want them to be sobbing at my funeral, thinking why they didn't they see the signs or why they didn't do anything about it. Why didn't they say they love me before I left or why didn't they hug me our last time seeing each other again. I don't want them to live in constant grief, and I don't want them to remember my face. I just want to die but I don't want to hurt them deep down. I know im saying this now but it hurts me to think about. I want to leave, I really do but I don't want this to happen to any of the people close to me. I don't want to affect them, I want them to be happy with all the memories we made together but I know there will be nights where they'll sob uncontrollably. Please, I need help. If I talk to them about it they'll become more alert and I don't want them to be like that. ",1
"Either to force life to be better or end it. I‚Äôve reached this point where I no longer feel like things will be better, and my energy to fight or do anything is gone.

"Hi, I'm 21 and I have been suicidal for many years since high school till university I don't want to keep continuing to do this. I have finished a degree in science and undertaking another degree however I have been feeling so burnt out and tired of everything I want to kill myself since high school had problems throughout high school got SA and then waited till university for things to hopefully get better however on the day of my graduation with cuts all over my neck I felt empty and dead I wasn't happy as my peers were. I already decided my fate during my university I was going to kill myself adulting is so hard there is nothing I have that's special in life or with myself. My parents already know that I have mental health problems yet I have not been given any help for it and neither do they want to give me help.I'm just so tired I have tried to attempt suicide many times but was scared I took a bunch of pills and doesn't work just vomitted my body couldn't react,  tried slitting my neck with a box cutter, cut my wrists multiple times and tried to hang myself it didn't work. I'm tired of living I really want to end it all I was planning on getting a gun to just quickly end it or down sleeping pills and drown myself in a river. I don't know anymore I don't have anyone to come to I'm ashamed and even if I did tell someone they pretend to care and then just leave me be not that I want involvement but I feel their words aren't genuine but I understand getting involved with me with a plethora of mental health problems will just be a mess. I'm sorry for being like this I'm sorry for being born I didn't want to be born I just want to die I want to end everything. I'm just so fucking sorry I don't know why I live.  I hate myself so much that I just want to tear myself in pieces I just want to die so much.I don't have anyone at the moment to confide in I'm just alone an empty shell of myself just in pain. I want help so bad but I'm at a point where I doubt I'll be able to do anything to change the way I feel after many failed attempts with suicide.",1
"I‚Äôm turning 22 in a few days and there is not one reason I can think of, to continue living. I recently failed an exam. I spent 70 hours a week studying for my master‚Äôs exams, just to  fail one of them. If I fail the  retake in a month I get kicked off the course, that‚Äôs like ¬£20K down the drain. The money came from my parents and my brother, they‚Äôve always supported me in terms of my education. My brother and my mum kept saying you better not fail, you know how much money ive spent and I have no faith I will pass. The amount of guilt I feel for all the money anyone has ever spent on a useless person like me is weighing me a lot. I worked my ass off for this masters, I went to classes every 5 days a week 9-5pm, studided after classes and still failed an exam. I passed 2 exams but the way my course is built is if I fail one I fail the entire course and get kicked off. I‚Äôve wasted so much money and time just to fail and I have no faith in myself that I will pass. It might be cowardly but I really just want to kill myself. Other than my mum and dad no one would miss me in the world.Right now I think the best course of action is just to end it. I can‚Äôt really think of any other options as I‚Äôm just tired to living ",1

"im tired and im sick and im done. i can‚Äôt remember the last time i felt happy. actually i cant remember the last time i felt anything at all. the thought of even the people closest to me being happy makes me sick with jealousy. they don‚Äôt know how blessed they are to even be able to experience that. everything keeps going wrong for me i tried telling myself it‚Äôd get better but everything has always just got steadily worse. there are days that aren‚Äôt as bad but they aren‚Äôt good days they are just not as bad as usual. all i do is sleep and work 24/7 and im not allowed time off work because i work a shit job that i can‚Äôt leave. 3 of my friends are on vacations right now and the jealousy i have is unreal. the jealousy i have when they even get a day off is insane because id quite literally kill for that. i dont look forward to the same things others do i feel like im simply holding on waiting for another moment when ill feel alive for a spilt second thats all i want. my life is so good yet i am so so unhappy. my grandpa almost dying, my mom in hospital, my close friend SAing me when i was drunk. all within a few weeks and all of which ive had to just suck it up and work through. ive cried for hours at work everynight for months straight and i get punished for not working hard enough. i tried to step down from my role as manager and they won‚Äôt let me do that either. i suffer more than everyone around me and its not fair i want to feel something i want to be happy so badly but it doesnt come and i physically dont have it in me to try anymore. its always 1 step forward and 10 steps back and i cant do it anymore",1

I had a boyfriend like last month, i finaly felt like  im doing something right like it had some meaning but then he left me, out of the blue, just said he didnt love me anymore that its not my fault.

"I feel so alone lol...  Yet I don't want to interact with people, I don't even want to see someone.When my family texts me, at times I wish they would just leave me alone... I fantasize about the thought of having no one in my life.Although I have deleted all social media, I still use YouTube at times and when I see someone. Can be anyone...It just makes me depressed. I don't know how to describe it, I just want to die. Every morning I actively ignore the mirror in my bathroom because I don't want to see how I look. Sometimes when I eat or just the thought of food... just makes me want to vomit.When I see someone I know, I can barely function. My anxiety just goes through the roof. Even with my siblings... I feel like I don't even know them. I don't feel comfortable around them.I was raised by my grandparents and I have not seen them in years and when I do speak to them... I feel like I don't even know them. In the past I would try to show some excitement that I am talking to them but they would respond as if I was stranger. I don't know how to describe it but having fun or just the thought of having fun just makes me want to die. Its practically cringe worthy to me... even when its nothing special.I just feel like I can't enjoy life. Anything related to enjoyment makes want to die? I don't even want anything from life really... One that that always surprises me is that, there are actually people in this world who enjoy life. Who wake up in the morning and are excited for life. People who simply have friends. People who know what they want. People who are not afraid to live in the moment. In my short time on this earth I have come close to death once, and I think about it everyday. If I had died that day, I would have been liberated from this pain. It was an accident so no one would suspect anything and I would be able to live this world knowing I did not hurt someone in the process. 'I also think about what a funeral would look like. I often hope people would not care. As if I had one wish, it would be that I did not interrupt their life with my death. ",1

I will die instantly and be crushed to death and there is absolutely no way I can survive it. I am just trying to decide which train/ track i should try. ,1
"I don't want to live to 20. I always thought I'd be dead before then, but I was unfortunately wrong. I cannot keep grappling with my CPTSD while I'm trapped in my abusers' household. I'm too chronically ill and disabled to return to college or work to leave this place, and I have absolutely nobody left in my life who cares about me. The only thing keeping me from attempting right now is the horribly traumatizing experience I had last year after being forcibly hospitalized and drugged against my will by my ""parents"". If I'm ever going to kick the bucket, I'm going to make sure I tell no one and that my method will certainly work. The reason I'm writing this is because the crippling loneliness within me has compelled me to see if anyone else is in my kind of situation. I have nothing left in life. No goals. No friends. No family. No future. No escape. I'm going to die here in this accursed house, it's only a matter of time...",1
It will never get better nothing has changed,1
"23f i moved out of home one year ago to live with my friends a state away. i did it with very little money but i had to leave. i have ptsd and other disabilities i dont feel comfortable sharing and i had completed a 6 month out patient program before moving away. my friends had to help me with rent that first month, when i lost my job in novemeber, and last month. i work in schools as a para for kids with autism and have for five years. this past year i had a gap in employment due to a workspace that was abusive to their students. since i work at a school i dont have anywhere to work in the summer. i applied for summer jobs as early as april and may. im supposed to be moving to a new place on thursday. the rent is 700 and the deposit is 1000. my previous rent was 780. i applied to over 30 jobs and didnt get anything. ive had to supplement with babysitting which has also been unfruitful and only able to pay for my medication and medical bills. aside from the deposit, i have 3000 on a dental credit card i need to finish paying off because my disability makes my teeth crack like clay. i have 2500 for a trip to the er last year. i have 1000 from an inpatient i stayed at overnight. i have 500 from urgent care visits when i needed stitches and blood tests. i dont know what to do. my mom has already paid for a hotel so im not homeless with my cat before i move in to a house i do not have the money for. i dont know what to tell my new roommates. the past year decimated my friendships i had with those i lived with. ive already sold my sentimental gold jewelry i had and im trying to sell my old acer but the screen doesnt work and requires an extra monitor to see it so i dont think it can actually sell for more than 400 in that condition. i am utterly and completely distraught. taking myself out of the equation isnt an option because it would leave my cat with no one to take her in my family already has two.i tried to start a bank loan today. i knew i needed to have rent and deposit. i knew an amount like this was coming. i knew it and i didnt know how to stop it. im a weak person who wasnt ready to be an independent adult and  i have made people who love me literallt pay the price force it because of what i am incapable of. i dont know what to do. TL;DR i owe more money than i can possibly pay and now i have no options left. i keep hurting people ",1

"Okay, so, i don't even know. Uh, k, so there's this thing that is a constant for me it never stops and so far doctors don't know why it is that way. So pretty much I'm always cold. I'm never not. Like I feel cold no matter how hot and sweaty I get, I can never feel warmth. I have a natural fever like I literally always have a fever. To other's I'm really warm/hot but to myself I'm freezing cold no matter what. Like even when a room is warm I don't feel it. Is becoming a big problem, especially since I do get infections sometimes and I can't feel if the ares is warm or not. And with other things is just becoming a problem.I do suffer from many things, so my speculation is that it's a combination of them, but I'm not sure. The doctors don't agree. I have/do suffer from ED along with lots of other mental and medical things.If anyone has any ideas please let me know, because I don't know anymore.",1
"After years of abuse, after taking care of adults instead of them taking care of me, after being neglected, after being in so much pain, I think it is finally time to say goodbye. May the sun shine on your face, may you see pretty butterflies on your walks, may all your dreams come true. :)",1
I‚Äôm just jealous of young kids them passed away so quickly. I wished I was dead when I was a toddler. Don‚Äôt have to worry about afterlife bullshit because only adults go hell and shit. ,1
I don‚Äôt want help with ‚Äúhow to cope‚Äù or being ‚Äúsaved‚Äù. I cannot do it anymore. I need help with growing a pair and going through with it idk what‚Äôs stopping me. I am 25 years old and I have never got to once in my life feel like I have a safe space. I have 2 wealthy parents still in my life but the hatred they harbour for me has made me into a broken push over causing people around me to realize they can get whatever they want out of me and I‚Äôm done with this being my life and there‚Äôs no way out. Due to my parents being wealthy student loans programs expect them to love me and cover tons of costs which they won‚Äôt and I‚Äôm in debt already from when they held me hostage for a year due to fear of the pandemic. I don‚Äôt want to hear ‚Äúit gets better‚Äù - ive heard that my whole life and it doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not even sure I have depression I just think my life is a pit with no way out and there‚Äôs nothing in that to be happy about. I can‚Äôt think of what could be stopping me cuz I have no reason or worth so what do I do to just do it. ,1

I naively believed that if I fixed my physical health that my mental health would improve. That was a load of bullshit lol. I lost 30lbs, I‚Äôve cleaned up my eating habits and I started working out regularly. That‚Äôs all fine and dandy except for all that work did Jack shit to improve my mental state. I have no friends and my family thinks i am a disappointment (i know because they told me so).

"(17M) I‚Äôve been struggling with depression for the past 5 years, especially with school and family issues, and have had several serious considerations of suicide in the past, but have never acted upon it. As I‚Äôm approaching the last few months of high school I keep getting this sense where I feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be here, but yet I am. I think its because a few years ago I never expected to make it through school but now I‚Äôm almost at the end of it. I‚Äôm definitely still struggling now as I‚Äôve been frequently resorting to SH, although I don‚Äôt exactly have any suicidal thoughts. So I was just kinda wondering if anyone else has had this feeling.",1

"She seemed a little odd these days. She said she was going to sleep at her aunt's house, but I asked her aunt if she really went there and it was a lie. I got so worried that I opened her diary (I know that is not alright but i was so so worried) and that's what I found... A suicide letter addressed to her loved ones... And it says that if she failed her first try or was stopped she would just do it anyway. I don't know what to do. Please help me if you know anything.

"I'm so tired of this life.I suffer from constant anxiety. I'm actually not bad at socializing, but I struggle to build durable social connections; every time dark feelings overwhelm me (which is often), my instinct is to get away from people and brood, so I have very few friends. I've met countless cute people at college and had interesting conversations with them, but due to my own problems these interactions never bloom into something meaningful. I feel very lonely and suffocated.I used to be a high achiever in school and I study in an elite college due to my high grades (equivalent to 1468 in the SAT for Americans), but for some years now I've developed a sense of apathy; I no longer have an inner drive to achieve and conquer new heights, I just don't care. The constant stress and competitve atmosphere drive me crazy. I skip lectures and struggle behind, and as a result I have finished only one semester's worth of courses despite being here for two years. They're likely to kick me out by the end of this semester, and if they do I could only return in two years' time - when I'll be 25. Twenty-five years old without a real profession and without future prospects. I know that if I wouldn't live to my full potential, I would spend the rest of my life feeling sorry for myself, regretful and envious of people who made it through. I don't want such a life. I'm so sick of being constantly worried and tired and sad and lonely, I just want to rest forever. But my family would be sad. I feel especially bad for my mom and my little sisters. I'm afraid my mom won't get over it. I love her more than any other person on this Earth and I don't know what to do. ",1
"I cant really take this anymore i cant live like this It feels as if there is no going around, there are no logic behind what im experiencing, and even if i tried to accept it and try to chase what i like it wont happenSo many things that are biological and cant be changed are killing meWhy i like chubby men for example? I tried to change this and i could not but what is hell for me is that the sitigma around them makes it impossible for me to be in a relationship with them even if its my dreamTheir chubby cheeks kills me, but of course someone who have a relationship with them, who try to change them for health or they r not attracted to them .. im like omg i wish i would even have a chance in my life to see them in front of my eyes and kiss themBut ofc thats not the caseSo many things i cant handle it emotionally Im lonelyI have so much burden and resentment inside of meLife is reversed for meWhats the norm isnt what is my norm in life...How why?

"i'm so tired of fighting the urge to kill myself, it seems like the only option and i'm tired of my disgusting thoughts that my ocd is pushing on me. I've tried meds,they hospitalized me and i was abused there,gave me wrong meds and refused to talk to me or change it, abused  kids there. I can't imm so tired of it and those flashes of kids there can't leave my mind they just come out of no where and i can't tell it to nobody around me because they do not listen or try to understand. My ""friend"" that i was very close with was just calling me to say how she's so happy for herself and is going to college, while i was sitting behind a phone chewing on my lunch thinking how she doesn't GAF about me and could care less. She is talking to me about her friend and saying she's stupid then hanging out with her again then again shitting on her, i'm sooo stupid for just listening to her whining and not cussing her the fuck out for being a stupid bitch. I don't have a relationship with my mom or dad ( i live w them but we don't talk much) like nobody in this damn stupid world care enough for me to stay alive. I wanna do it soso bad it's not even funny anymore. I'm fucking mentally ill, lesbian  and a bad person. There's nothing for me to stay alive anymore. Being a lesbian is nothing bad but my parents or people around me won't see the same like they would be even more disgusted of me and it's another reason for my parents to trash talk me. I was thinking of popping a bunch of pills and drinking strong alcohol with it or just jumping from a tall building. ",1

"Basically since graduating college I‚Äôve lost all my friends, my family, and my hobbies. I‚Äôm currently homeless living out of my car. My debit card is overdrawn $200. My credit card payments are coming up and I‚Äôm about to default on my debt. To make matters worse I was offered my dream job 2 years ago right after graduating, in my favorite city in the world, where all my best friends and Roomate‚Äôs and ex girlfriend are from and live in. It was an entry level position but after 2000 hours of working it I‚Äôd be promoted making six figures. My office also had an ocean view in one of the richest/nicest parts of the city. My family didn‚Äôt help me with moving to take it though. I worked all through college also and made $15 an hour plus tips at a bar plus money from music gigs but didn‚Äôt make enough to save for a move post college. I am just really struggling to cope with what is and what could‚Äôve been. I got another job in my field that only paid $20 an hour because the more conservative state my family is in doesn‚Äôt bother funding my field. I ended up losing it due to mental issues, a raise dispute, and a new supervisor that was just terrible. In my mind I should be making six figures by now, with an office on the ocean, surrounded by my best friends and loved ones, practicing my hobbies regularly and making money off one of them, and basically living my dream. Instead I‚Äôm homeless and my life is a literal nightmare. I bought a gun recently to ensure I never truly end up on the streets if it comes to it. I worked with the homeless and my father is homeless sleeping at bus stops around my grandmas house eating out of dumpsters. I will never let myself end up like that. I‚Äôm just struggling to bring my self to pull the trigger and thought it would be easy. ",1
I‚Äôm actually so close to doing it.i can‚Äôt take this anymore I hate life it‚Äôs so unfair. Every time I get happy again and get hopeful something just knocks me down again and I‚Äôm  just done.

I can‚Äôt take school anymore. I‚Äôm not even interested in what I‚Äôm going to college for. The job that I actually want doesn‚Äôt require a degree, but it does require a LOT of time, work, and money to some extent. I have no friends. I‚Äôm extremely bad at socializing and I‚Äôve been that way for years. I‚Äôm not attractive and I don‚Äôt generally share a lot of interests with most people. I don‚Äôt know how to meet people and when I do, I‚Äôm the world‚Äôs driest person without even realizing it.I also hate texting / being on my phone all the time for that reason I‚Äôm trying so hard to just focus on myself and getting things together but it feels like every time I try to make any progress, I‚Äôm being sent back so much more. I have no money left. I had a ton of money saved up and I‚Äôve had to spend almost all of it on school and emergencies with my dog. I‚Äôm currently left with $800. I have almost no clothes that fit me. My shoes are falling apart. I have two pairs of underwear left. My back pack is literally sewn together because the straps fell off. I have to take my dog to the vet again because he hurt his leg and that will easily be $300 MINIMUM. I have to pay for my classes this semester too, which will be around $600. I‚Äôm going to have nothing left in my account. I still have to get my other wisdom tooth removed and I have jury duty coming up. I need to go get my blood work done and have another appointment after that, which I have almost no time for and I‚Äôm supposed to be saving up for surgery but I now have no money going towards that either and can‚Äôt save for it while I‚Äôm saving for other things. I just don‚Äôt know how to deal with all of it alone. I feel so overwhelmed I don‚Äôt know what to do. For the kind of work that I want to do, internships are really hard to find. I was planning on leaving next summer to go do the internship which is out of state, but i have to have EVERYTHING in order before then. I have to have a car and license, have as much money saved up as possible, make sure my dog is doing well and figure out what I‚Äôm doing with him during that internship. I need to figure out my college situation and my medication. i also have to build my other basic skills up before that internship, which costs money. I‚Äôm transgender and was hoping to get top surgery before that internship, but now I don‚Äôt think that i can and I might have to postpone that internship another year because I have to afford it and I can‚Äôt/won‚Äôt be able to go work if I‚Äôm healing from the surgery.

"M16. I‚Äôve had this friend who‚Äôs a girl who we‚Äôll call J. And we‚Äôve been friends for about 3 years now. And how we first met was she was dating my friend. And they were together for about a year. And me and her got along really well and would talk frequently. I thought she was pretty and like I said we liked talking to each other. But I never really wanted to date her or anything so never asked or mentioned anything like that. Also especially because she was with my friend as well. Then they broke up but me and her kept talking because we became really good friends. I considered her probably my closest and best friend. But I still never mentioned anything about dating because I was honestly fine with just being her friend and also because I thought there was no way she would ever like me back. I have depression, anxiety and Body Dysmorphic Disorder as well as Facial Dysmorphic Disorder. Then she got a new boyfriend like a year and a half ago. And I was fine with that and we remained friends. Then they started having problems and ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù. A couple days after we were talking then she asked me if ‚ÄúI had some sort of attraction to her.‚Äù I decided to be honest and although I was hesitant because I was afraid this would ruin our relationship, I said yes. To my surprise, she said she was attracted to me as well and even said that when she was with my friend when she saw me, she thought she chose the wrong person. She said she always thought I was handsome and all this stuff. Then we went on a couple of dates and hanged out a lot more, and everything was going really well. Also side note and I‚Äôd rather not talk too much about it. But I‚Äôve had a couple of incidents with self-harm and although it‚Äôs gotten a bit better, I still have thoughts about it every now and then, and my anxiety and everything else I mentioned is still really really bad. She knew this as well as the fact that I had to go to both a psychiatric residential home and the emergency room because of those incidents. And again, I don‚Äôt want to talk too much about it. But she was more like dominant I guess in our relationship while I was more submissive and she would comfort me and help me feel better when I was feeling really sad. We even took things to the next step if you know what I mean. And part of why we were friends and why I was attracted to her besides her looks was we had a lot in common, like, emotionally? We‚Äôve each had really hard lives and could vent with each other and comfort each other. So she was complex and we could relate to one another. Also she wasn‚Äôt a complete idiot. Then it turns out her and some of her friends already had planned to go to this theme park with her ex. So even though she ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt want to‚Äô she had to go and be with him again to do that. They would argue a lot when they were together, like a lot a lot. And after the theme park, everything seemed fine. Then like a couple of weeks later we were being intimate together and stuff. Then a while after, we started talking for a long time because she was feeling really sad. Then the next day she completely ghosted me. Turns out her ex contacted her again and promised to ‚Äòchange‚Äô and bought her a locket or something. I guess she really liked that. After not talking to me for about 3 days she started talking to me again. Says basically let‚Äôs just be friends again because all that happened too fast even though she instigated all of it. I was heartbroken but said fine. Stuff was sorta okay for a bit. But I felt like I genuinely wanted not to exist and like I‚Äôm a huge fuck up and to be honest, sort of used and manipulated. And so badly just wanted to be loved. My at home life is pretty terrible, my parents divorced and are both really poor and in toxic relationships and not very nice to me to say the least. I eventually told her how I felt. And she said that she really does love me and meant everything she said. But I felt like she just felt guilty because she knows of my problems but was lying. I told her basically what I‚Äôve said up till now and how horrible and badly I missed her. We talked a bunch about it. Then she asked ‚Äòdo I still like her?‚Äô I said yes. Then she said let‚Äôs not talk for a month or two thinking I won‚Äôt like her anymore after that time. I had no choice but to say yes. And now I just really miss her and her kindness and love. And want to be friends again or anything really. Just to be loved. And I‚Äôm not really sure what I should do, I feel like I can‚Äôt move on. And like it could‚Äôve worked. We had no issues whatsoever. Not a single argument. But to her I‚Äôm just a number 2. A second choice. And feel really really not good. I found a way to communicate with her after she blocked me on everything. A lot happened. We tried to just be friends. She kept sending photos of her with her boyfriend and saying how they‚Äôre gonna get married. She talked to me a lot less and also started acting different like a lot less nice and sorta like I was a joke. She then told me that her boyfriend fucking hates me now and so does all of his and her friends. I got mad and said I hate her. She didn‚Äôt like that. I told her I didn‚Äôt and I just hated myself and how I feel about her and was blinded by my emotions she didn‚Äôt care. Blocked me, no way for us to talk now. I tried to kill myself decided not to for my family. Now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel unlovable. She was the only person to treat me with any kindness or love and allowed me to have friends. I‚Äôm truly truly alone now and want to die. I still love her. And she hates me.",1

I'm fourteen and I've dealt with some horrible things in life and some are worse than others for example I have lost so many people both pets and friends and I have dealt with two pedos before and I even have a verbally abusive mom who just shouts at me every day and I'm sick of it I can never find peace and the rare moments where I do find peace it's interrupted by my mom and I even killed myself before I was born as if I knew I was going to have a shit life but I was brought back from the dead and I just feel as if my mom nor father nor my sister care about me and I have tried many times to kill myself but I keep holding myself back thinking that maybe my mom would learn when I speak to her about it but it doesn't matter if I tell her she hurts me with her words because after a few days she'll just go back to her old ways and I am thinking of killing myself fr this year since life has genuinely fucked me over since I was created.,1
"I'm 25, have no life goals, have a dead end job, have very few friends (I do have a wonderful fianc√© for whom I'm very grateful for though), dropped out of college at 18, don't even have a drivers license. I feel like I'm going absolutely nowhere in life. I'm just an absolute low-life loser. I have autism, adhd, severe clinical depression, anxiety, ocd, and cptsd. I have tried several different medications with little success. Therapy has helped some, but not really eliminated the most pressing issues. Every day feels like a chore, and I feel a pit of despair inside me at almost all times. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I can hardly even get out of bed at times. I just feel like an absolutely worthless sack of shit. I know that there are steps I could take to improve my life, I guess, but I know myself too well to think I'll actually do anything about it. I feel absolutely paralyzed to do anything for some reason. Even if I did, I doubt it would improve how I'm feeling all that much. I've had recurrent suicidal ideation since i was 9, and it's there regardless of my life circumstances. This isn't even mentioning my anxiety, it's gotten to the point of borderline agoraphobia. I'm too anxious to even talk to my family, I've ghosted friends over it, sometimes it even gets in the way of day to day life tasks. I suppose it's also related that I'm MtF, I've been on hrt for 5 years, and I'm still too scared of what others will think of me to transition. I can see my poor fianc√© getting increasingly frustrated with dealing with me, despite their insistance that I'm not a burden and that they like being around me. We've been bickering a lot more recently. Well, i guess bickering isn't the right word, more like he brings up his frustrations with me, and I completely agree, because frankly, it has gotten ridiculous at this point. I feel like I'm running out of reasons not to kill myself. The world isn't a better place with me in it. The only things keeping me from doing it now is not wanting to traumatize my fianc√© and not knowing whether or not my life insurance will pay enough to help them pay the rest of our lease. But it's getting harder to hold on, and that makes me feel even worse because of how incredibly selfish it is. ",1
"I don't want to get better. I only want it all to end.why would I want to get better if I don't want to live. But I don't want leave my mother alone, that's the only reason I'm still alive. I can't keep living just to keep her happy anymore though ",1
"I seriously dont know what to do. I'm in a gc with 3 people, and one of them mostly just talks about how they want to hurt and kill themselves. The self harm, and often talk about how theyre planning to kill themselves and when they are, and stuff like theyre planning to buy knives to hurt themselves. Me, along with another person in the group, always try to comfort and discourage them, but eve if we get them to back down it aways comes up a few days later. Its almost like they dont want help. Often shooting us down and saying its no point when we're trying to help. Also often questioning why I'm trying to help them. How do I help someone who barely even wants help? Do they want help? I alwas try to stay there for them no matter what, and try to get them to feel better, but its honestly starting to come at the expense of my own health. Would I be a asshole if I decide to end things and stop being friends? I sad I would be there for them, and do everything to help them get better. But its just so hard to help somone who barely accepts th help. I feel like itbarely effects my health, more like a annoyance or inconvinience than anything, and after everything I don't feel like I'm allowed to say I want to cut contact. I cant abandon them but I dont want to have to keep talking someone out of suicide again, its not as bad as last time but its still a bit draining, especially when its constant. Like multiple times a week. I feel like such a hypocrite, especially since I acted simelarly in the past, before I got better. I dont know if I can help them but I feel like I'm not allowed to leave. What do I do? What can I do?",1
"I wanna kill myself and I have my whole life. It‚Äôs not that i don‚Äôt necessarily understand life has ups and downs, i do. It‚Äôs just i don‚Äôt want to go through them. I feel everything and people around me make me feel crazy for my emotions. My down right now is that i have to move out all on my own AGAIN with 4 cats. I got fired a few days ago before this. I have no money and i hate asking for help. The urge to kill myself is insane. None of my close friends care i can tell. I know my mom isn‚Äôt gonna help me for fuck sake i‚Äôm a highschool drop out.

I‚Äôm tired of going through this i can‚Äôt take it im not strong. I don‚Äôt have enough will power to carry on. I can‚Äôt deal with how much life changes i never could.

"I really just want to smash my head through glass and cut my throat and put my fingers in my eyes and hitting my head with the wall. I'm tired, I really just want to die. It's the only thing that I want. There's nothing else in my life, I don't have a life, what else can I do that isn't dying? My loved ones are gonna be sad? Who fucking cares? I'm gonna be dead anyway, I won't have feelings. Besides, it's pretty fucked up that I should still live for THEIR sake, oh yeah, let me just feel nothing but wanting to die just because me killing myself would make you sad. It's awful. ",1

I need a movie to escape and be addicted. Please help.,1
"I had a long lasting psychotic break last September. Changed my personality, changed how i saw everything in life. Fucked me up real good. I got better once I evened out my meds, but I've never lost the urge to end my life. I've been battling it this whole time.  I got in a self inflicted motorcycle accident last April that took away my ability to walk normally for the rest of my life. Had to get a pretty intensive ankle surgery resulting in 7 screws and a plate. My other leg is fucked up pretty badly from a high speed wreck a few years back (also self inflicted due to lack of caring about my life at the time)Went down my friends list and blocked a lot of people close to me. Figured itd make it easier.my biggest worry is that my two amazing cats go to a good home. Trying to find one now.  I'm in the process of repairing my bike. I plan on crashing it at high speeds with no protective gear. I know there's a chance that I'll survive and become a vegetable for the rest of my life, but I don't count on that happening. Bike should be repaired in the coming days. I have fully lost the will to live and don't want to pursue a future anymore. I wish I never made it this far. Wrote this all out a few days ago and wanted to make sure it was the route i wanted to go. ",1
I don‚Äôt want to die. But I also don‚Äôt want to be alive and don‚Äôt see how I could be. What happened today is just kinda the final thing of many. I just don‚Äôt know anymore. Everytime I think I‚Äôm doing better something happens. Wish I could just be brave enough to do it already. Would have saved myself a lot of pain a long time ago. ,1
"I've been just thinking a lot recently. People say things like we are here for the human experience or to learn something and serve others but like what if you're just not having it... Like if I'm not having a good time, most of the people around me aren't having a good time, I generally am the one that starts problems and arguments, I don't really have friends, like why should I stay for the experience if the experience is shit.. and this isn't like l'm just going through something right now, I've been a shit disturber since I was born and I'm 26 now. I've never fit in not in school or teams or even in my family. Not everyone can be the protagonist, some people just are the antagonist. So why would it be such a big deal to just end the game. Anyone upset would genuinely just be missing the idea of me because no one actually likes me around now. Like, I'm not going to make plans or do anything but like it just makes me think and I can't really talk to anyone. People say life has ups and down but like I definitely can even on good days I just don‚Äôt think anyone benefits from me being around. I‚Äôm just suffering. Im making my parents suffer by still needing to rely on their support and not really being able to give back. My siblings suffer because we have no real relationship and so I‚Äôm just the shitty kid that is taking advantage of my parents. I‚Äôm in a pipe band and don‚Äôt really get along with anyone but I‚Äôm also just kinda shit and unreliable so they don‚Äôt really benefit from me being around. Most importantly I‚Äôm not benefiting. I‚Äôve been an outcast since I was born, job market sucks, housing market sucks, this society only likes straight white skinny people and I don‚Äôt fit in that box. Idk, literally why would it be a bad thing. Everyone would benefit really. ",1
"My girlfriend broke up with me randomly a few nights ago after us hanging out and being all affectionate. My uncle is in the hospital right now dying from sepsis in the ICU and they don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôs going to live. My job just fired me and to top it off my car‚Äôs completely broken so i‚Äôm home-bound with no choice other than to be stuck in my burden of a mind.The last time my suicidal urges were this strong was when I was first diagnosed with PTSD after a severe attack that almost killed me. I think about suicide all day and night, life seems to just be getting worse and worse and I quite literally can‚Äôt take it anymore and I am so genuinely exhausted and done with this pointless joke of a life.I was also born in the wrong body, might as well get freedom from it for once. I really do think for once in my life i‚Äôm going to be selfish and take my own life eventually. I can‚Äôt do anything to prevent it at this point, I want it so badly I know i‚Äôm going to cave in one of these nights and finally do it. And it pains me so bad to even admit how selfishly I have wanted to die for years upon years.I want to die, hopefully I will soon, I probably will soon.My life‚Äôs so completely pointless and just not right at all, it‚Äôs not worth it. It never was.Hopefully I can get a peace of mind soon. ",1
"I'm 35 (f) , and when I was 32 I met the love of my life. She was 13 years older than me, but that never mattered to either of us. She was bright, bubbly, mischievous in the best possible way and the light at the end of a very dark tunnel for me. I won't say my life has ever been easy. It's been marred by severe parental abuse, a stint of homelessness and the loss of my 2 year old son when I was 30 after we were hit by a drunk driver while walking home from the park. I won't go into details about the shit sandwich I experienced before I met my love. I guess it's not relevant. Myself and my love fell in love quickly, and were living together by the time we had known each other for 6 months. It might sound crazy, but I knew with every ounce of me very early on  that she was the one for me. We never really left the honeymoon phase of our relationship. We were just deeply in love. Two weeks ago, I lost the love of my life to a sudden aneurysm while she was at work. For 14 days I've been planning how to join her. For 336 hours I've been writing letters to our friends, donating my belongings and cancelling direct debits/notifying service providers that they'll no longer be required. Tonight. I think I'm going to do it tonight. I have everything I need to get the job done. I just need that last bit of courage. I've never been more sure of anything in my life than I am about not waking up.",1
"Good day! 29M.Pain is my most loyal companion. Not leaving my side for even a second. That is why I want to leave it the only way I know.I have had a life of and dancing and movement, which made my life bearable. For the last 3 years I had severe chronic pain, I can't walk properly so all of it gone. Recently I got nerve damage in my arm too, and lost my sense of taste and now I am restricted to canes. ( I have been to several doctors, surgeries, methods so far ). Because of the above I can't even do any meaningful exercise because of the pain.I have no close friends, no significant other, people are distant when I bring up so I feel ashamed of my condition. What hurts the most, that I cannot take care of myself anymore. I am at the mercy of others, the pity of others. I feel like I am nothing and the condition is worsening. I think I could help myself if I had a little hope for reducing the pain and helplessness, but I feel it drained me out too much already.I don't want to watch the world go by me, as I have for 3 years.  So I thought of ending this suffering sometime in autumn. Thinking of death feels me with peace and calmness which I haven't felt a lifetime ago (as it feels for me).I am truly sorry if this doesn't sound urgent enough, but had to share with someone.Thank you for listening to me.",1
"Last there for 5secs my brain and heart went back to being normal. Not happy not sad just silent like that. It was the first time I felt some peace in two months. I feel asleep and woke up with pain again, the whole day I'm on the verge of breaking down. My dad passed away last month and a month before that she broke up with me. I'm just existing for my mom, sister and my two dogs. I had to quit my job and come back to my hometown to live with my family. My mind is messed up, I don't think I'll ever be normal again. It's fucked up and all I think about I death. I feel empty yet the mind is filled with endless thoughts, it feels like it could burst anyminute. I wish my heart would just stop. Ive lost my happiness, i am not able to create it again. I try, trust me I really try but I just am not able to. Time is not healing. It's not helping.

I just want to say I'm a terrible child, brother, friend, and student, a cheat, fraud, liar, loser, whatever. I have people who love me but all I can do is hurt them.

"random account. I‚Äôm 17, 5 months ago I self discovered myself as a pedophile, I looked at all the online resources  to figure everything a pedophile does, what occurs and the warning signs. I was determined to find out I was confused and stressed out and I still am because before that I was perfectly fine but sometimes it could occur later in puberty. It didn‚Äôt make sense, I liked girls my age and older so for that to happen was sad.

"I've came to the conclusion that stabbing my neck is the most effective way to die. I have a good life with good friends and a majority good family, but I want an easy way out of everything. I haven't seen life as something worth doing. I just sit at my fucking computer all day doing hot shit when school's approaching and I have zero purpose. I do not see a timeline in which I am a valuable member to society and I refuse to deal with a fucking boss at a 7 dollars an hour job when I turn 18. By the way I barely turned 13 so that's cool too. I fucking hate my own grandmother and I feel so bad. My family knows she's narcissistic but she is old and I don't want to have these feelings. This is awesome added on to the fact that most of the people at my school suck and the friends I do have I don't want to tell this to and for some reason I don't care. Also doesn't help that i am annoying as fuck. Pretty much the only reason that I am still alive is the fact that I will go to hell if God is real and the accounts of excruciating pain for minutes of people who have tried the method I am going for. I am kind of confident that I will die with enough research done on where to strike but pain is still a factor even if I get my wish. So here's the plan. Thursday is the only viable option I have for suicide as it is the only day nobody will be around. So I have a game for you: convince me NOT to commit suicide by Thursday. I won't make this easy though, I can give you counter points. I'll try to reply every day but I usually don't commit to shit except this. I've been wanting this since I realized nobody outside of my family liked me around 6th grade and all my memories of shitty things I did came back to torment my ass. At this point there's nothing stopping me that I can't counterargue coming out of my head so I'm looking to you guys.",1
My depression lingers like a constant black cloud no matter what I do and the constant resentment of living against my will and for other people is destroying me and making me consumed by anger and bitterness. My suicidal thoughts are daily and persistent and everything I do feels like it's just to keep them quiet enough to function. I'm drinking hard alcohol before noon today full of dread about life and my future. I had meds and quit taking them due to side effects and zero benefits. Therapy and doctors have been useless to me. I have no real friends or anyone to talk to and I just want to get fucked up enough to not think for a while.,1

"Hi :)I am writing this because I can't tell anyone in real life.People see me as a success, I have a good job. I graduated from a professional course, I have lots of friends etc.My life went downhill just over a year ago, I started a new job and was bullied by the bosses. It escalated to online bullying that was reported in the local news.People made websites suggesting I should be killed. I became depressed and withdrawn. Its funny how when I was successful, going out, meeting people etc I had lots of friends. When I needed my friends the most I had no one.Today the police came to my flat, I was alone as usual. I was told that someone said that they were coming to harm me and they had a van and knife.After 3 hours of questions they left. Most people have someone to call after getting news like that- I tried and everyone was busy.I sat there for 2 hours, then I decided, I am going to kill myself before someone does it to me.Months of death threats have taken their toll-I can't live in fear anymoreNo one will miss me if I am gone, nobody calls or texts anymore  The police had 9 months to do something but they did not, I do not think anything will ever happen  I cant work, I lost my career  My family will understand suicide more than murder.Its 10:30pm, I said phoned my mum as usual, smiled at the receptionist. Everyone thinks everything is normal, and that is good no one will discover me. I cancelled all appointments, told people I was overwhelmed and taking time away from my phone. I do not want to be discovered until its too late, I made up my mind. I have been feeling suicidal for months, but hanging on in case stuff got better.I still think stuff can get better- I just do not have the energy or bravery to hang on until it does.I don't care if people make up stuff about me when I am gone. No one was there when I needed them, no one cared enough to just talk.Fear was the final straw, but loneliness and isolation weakened me.",1
"I want to go into the forest and look for a tree I can spend the rest of my life with. By the rest of my life, I mean until I die from hunger or thirst. I can't live with my thoughts anymore.

I know dying from dehydration or hunger is a slow death but at least I'll be completely empty in my last days and at least my body can decompose quietly. ",1
"i‚Äôve been feeling ‚Äúsuicidal‚Äù for around 3 years now, though the feeling has kicked up in the past year. i tend to almost fantasize about my suicide every day, imagining people‚Äôs reactions and knowing everything will be over. i have a suicide note drafted in my notes app. when things get stressful i think about it. when people mention my future i don‚Äôt know what to say because i can‚Äôt imagine living past 22.   however i‚Äôve never really tried to self harm or attempt suicide before, so i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôm as depressed or suicidal as others. i don‚Äôt know which method I‚Äôd use either, though researching it brings me a lot of peace. i haven‚Äôt made a plan of action yet. does this mean i‚Äôm suicidial, or am i just like every other dramatic teenager? sorry for the yap.

"I can't do it. I'm not strong enough to save myself. I've been trying but it's so overwhelming. I'll be stuck like this forever. There's no future for me. I have to die. There's no other ending. I'll drink myself stupid this week. Desperately try to find some moments of joy. Then shoot and hang myself to make sure it sticks this time. No one will be sorry, but I'll finally be free from it all. I'm sorry for posting this. It's selfish, but I want someone to remember my pain.  ",1

"One bestfriend assulted me and is no longer my friend. Another seems to not want much to do with me anymore. I dont know what i did to deserve this. I have one friend left in the world and when i need her the most shes obsessed with her new boyfriend. It hurts more than anything. And i already left a note i dont know if im gonna go through with it. But i want to. All id have to do is wait for the train. I'm going to try to just wait, wait out the night, the week, the month. But i can't live like this for another year. Not alone. I'm only 20 but my life is just a big series of traumas. I can't handle another.",1
"Unlike other adults, I don't have the best set of life skills in the world. At best I can do basic home maintenance, can poorly cook some things, and can drive (although I have driving anxiety so it's a pain to do that). I make $2000 a month if I work 45 hours a week at my job. For where I live with the expenses we have, we usually need to combine my income and my parents' incomes to survive. Not only would I have to suffer the emotional pain of losing them, I might end up homeless as well. Granted, even with the strained relationship I have with my parents, I'd still be incredibly hurt by their passing.Point being, I don't know what else I would do in my life after they're gone. Living is so fucking expensive and tiring, I don't know if I'd be able to survive on my own when I inevitably lose them. And my lack of life skills won't help either. I just feel so fucking lost.",1

Is there maybe not something specific i can take that won't mess me up in unpredictable ways of the sort?

"Me and my Boyfriend met online and are long distance. We‚Äôve met in person multiple times and he‚Äôs coming to see me again soon.  I am so in love with him like I know he‚Äôs the one. He‚Äôs a genuine sweetheart and it‚Äôs so refreshing in my generation. He talks about getting married and growing old with me. He‚Äôs the first person to give me hope about my future, where before I didn‚Äôt think it would exist. But I‚Äôve been struggling with multiple disorders and having a hard time recently. He‚Äôs been incredibly loving and patient with me. He has never gotten upset with me despite all the outbursts I have. Noticing these things, I‚Äôve changed how I react. He makes me calm. But I have an increasing fear of being a burden as I‚Äôm getting older. This leads me to withdraw from relationships because I‚Äôm scared of being abandoned. Sometimes I‚Äôm so triggered or depressed that I don‚Äôt text him for hours, which is a lot because we‚Äôre both very clingy. He has the same issues as me just less impulsive about it so I sometimes realize I‚Äôm treating him this way, and he‚Äôs just as scared as me. I‚Äôm better than  when I used to go days not talking to him, Although the urge is still there. There‚Äôs just so many things that I feel guilty he has to deal with. Every time we talk it‚Äôs about my mental health because it‚Äôs all I‚Äôm thinking  about. And then later I feel so vulnerable and embarrassed for being too open. I feel like he‚Äôd be better off without me , I talk to him about this a lot and he just stands his ground that he will love me forever. I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve him. I don‚Äôt know why he is still with me and at this point i think it‚Äôs stressing me out more than him. I‚Äôve been in and out of the hospital the past few years, I feel like my personal life is too much for him. I‚Äôm not a normal person, i don‚Äôt want to get a job I don‚Äôt want to eat or talk or do anything. He has goals and money and a life and I just feel below him. A few weeks ago i was in a slightly better place where I thought I‚Äôd work on myself so I could have a future with him but it‚Äôs getting worse again, and I feel that it‚Äôs unfair for him to be with me. Is the answer obvious? He‚Äôs my best friend and I genuinely don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever love someone again if it‚Äôs not him.  I have no one else and I don‚Äôt want anyone else. I don‚Äôt want to keep him from his full potential because he has so much ahead of him. Neither of us will ever break up with each other. I promised. I know I don‚Äôt want help.but I guess this is me subconsciously asking for it. I strongly believe I‚Äôm going to die by suicide young and I‚Äôve thought that since I was 10. I‚Äôm thinking about how it‚Äôs my only way out, and I‚Äôm going through the process of realizing that. No one  can  control me but me. I was not meant for this I‚Äôm scared",1
"I'm a 24 yo male. Always had the thoughts but didnt consider it seriously till last year and the entire year was hell, i always calmed myself down by thinking about the pain i would put my family in but that started to lose its affect. Whenever i try to open up about it to a friend amost every time its the same suggestion which is to change my routines, having a Job that i dont enjoy at all and almost hate, but those are not the problem but the results of living with a worn out soul and burnt out psychology for a decade. Whatever i do i do with pain, i do it cause i want to be done with it even if its supossed to be a fun, joyful stuff. For years i thought having someone in my life would solve some of these problems and help me get rid of the depression or whatever it is, but i started to notice this is now a permanent mental state, dont want to work, dont want to love, dont want to have anything, always being in pain and agony led to constant fear of loss,cant trust myself for enduring any process, cant trust anyone else to love, share or even to talk sometimes, dont even know what i expect from sharing here, entered the app with a hope to find some effective ways to off myself but found myself here. Peace out i guess",1
"I‚Äôm 13, I‚Äôve had a good enough life, I mean, it could have been better but im not going to complain when I know there‚Äôs worse, I just don‚Äôt want to live anymore.

But I won't for one reason that I won't share. I don‚Äôt want to grow up and spend thousands of dollars on an education for a job I won‚Äôt even like for money I can‚Äôt even use because it‚Äôs going to taxes and the government until I‚Äôm old and grey. I'm scared. There‚Äôs nothing to do, nothing to see, climate change is a huge problem but not enough people care to fix it because they either think it‚Äôs pointless or they‚Äôre rich and healthy and they don‚Äôt want to focus on problems other than themselves, there's not going to *be* a future for any ""next generation"" because nobody cares! I don't know what I want for myself, I don't know if I want to be a girl or if I want to cut my hair and get top surgery, I don't know if I want to move far away or if I'll just stay, I'm so goddamn indecisive it's so stupid. Anyway, back to what I was saying, life sucks, everything is pointless, nothing feels real, and I just want to die. ",1

"Sorry for the length, had to get this off my chest.TL;DR- Diagnosed with TS years ago and feeling horrible because of it. Now I'm dealing with the problem of forgetting on top of that and I don't know what to do.Hello everyone, it's nice to hear there are communities like this one that are there for those who need it, to which at this point I'm willing to try out for myself. Hell, I'd try anything to get rid of the thoughts I get every now and then. Sorry if I don't make sense, it's currently 4 AM and I have yet to sleep.I (19 M) have been feeling negatively about myself for a while now. One of the lowest points I've been has to be a few years ago, before and after I was first diagnosed with a condition known as Tourettes (I'll shorten this to TS). To keep it short for those who don't know, TS is essentially involuntary movements split into motor and vocal tics (I make random movements and noises). I'm currently taking medication for it, and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.Before I was diagnosed and got treated, my tics happened constantly, which started becoming a problem in 6th grade and progressively got worse. Every day, especially in class, I would make a (very loud) noise every few seconds and adjust my neck and shoulders every now and then, which I still do to this day. I was bullied for it, and to be honest, this condition makes me feel like an anomoly whether or not people notice. March of 2023 comes around and I see my neurologist who gives me the diagnosis of TS. I was sad but thought nothing of it.  Now that I found the problem surely there'd be a solution, right? Well, my life started falling apart after that. 3 months before I graduate that same year, I come to find out the career choice that I have been preparing myself mentally for all these years does not become the option for me anymore. The reason? The medication I'm taking has the side effect of drowsiness, which is a huge deal. I've had to scramble to find another option, having to decline my acceptance into my dream university. The military isn't even an option either, as they require I be off the medication for a while and I'm heavily dependant on it. I took a gap year because of that, but I've found a new path to take. Even so, I've dreaded myself since I'm feeling like I'm falling behind everyone else and the opportunities lost that I would have had had I been a perfectly healthy guy.Then comes the other issue I've had to deal with. See, I think I'm a somewhat decent person to be around, but the issue is I tend to forget a lot of things all the time. And when I mean ""a lot,"" I mean anytime someone tells me to do something, to look for something, or to even recall a memory from not too long ago (like from conversations we've had the day prior), I would not be able to recall it at all. It's gotten to the point where my parents and anyone I talk to become frustrated with me, and it's making me wonder about what is even wrong with me. Recently, when my girlfriend talks to me on the phone I kept repeating the same things to her on multiple occasions. When she called that out, I immediately got self conscious about it and didn't know what to say or even do. It even affects the way I handle things at work. Whenever I'm given a task, I have to constantly ask what it was I was supposed to do. I'm surprised I even held the job for an entire year (it's my first part time).Both of these issues make me think I'm such a burden on whoever I interact with. I don't want to suffer like this anymore. Sure, I'll forget about these feelings one day and act like my normal self again, but it's only a matter of time until I really get to a bad point. I am looking to take advantage of my college's therapy sessions, but if that doesn't work, I'm considering giving up. Why should everyone have to suffer for my mistakes?I just want this to end. For everyone's sake.",1

"You know how it is when you are struggling with suicidal thoughts for years and years. This year I finally snapped . Prepared everything (not that well$). Made some videos for my family, friends and stuff. Went to the beach and stayed their until the moon was shining. No one was there to prevent me from doing it . No one was there to save me neither . Ngl I was terrified as fuck. My biggest fear was deep sea and I still chose it to be my grave. You know what‚Äôs crazier ? Is that on my way to the beach, in my heart it really felt like I was already dead. I was just taking the road to meet my judgment. Even at the beach sun was rising like it was my time. I pictured my whole life and felt happy . I felt free . I felt grateful. So at night I took 4 or 5 sleeping pills, handcuffed my self and jumped into the water. Since I‚Äôm a good swimmer I managed to get far with the strength of the waves. I didn‚Äôt even notice I was far from my initial point. I can clearly remember it as  nightmare I had . I was drowning. Omg the pain. The salty water getting in my mouth and my nose was horrible . At some point I couldn‚Äôt even manage the strength of the waves. I don‚Äôt know what got Into me cuz it was blank at a moment (maybe cuz I was under water). I just jumped off the water and shouted ‚ÄúI DONT WANNA DIE YET‚Äù . I used all my remaining strength and manage to pull myself out of the water. I ran as fast I as could. Grabbed my backpack and my shoes and ran to the road since there were many crimes on that beach. I got home. At least no one watched my videos . I torn apart all my letters and deleted all the videos. Since then even while in the taxi back home, I was thinking.   I realized I own myself . I realize fuck this shit  man. I‚Äôm not letting anyone ever again to push to these extremes. I can‚Äôt put everything I feel in this post but. My point of view on depression, suicide, life , friends , family, girlfriend changed. I‚Äôve being too altruistic my whole life. No more . Now I‚Äôll think about myself first !

"I've tried killing myself before, I took a bunch of pills and was hoping to just die and get it over with but my family found me and called 911, getting me to the hospital and stopping anything too bad from happening. After watching me for a couple days to make sure everything was out of my system and that I wouldn't have any complications, they sent me to a behavioral health unit and I was stuck there for around two weeks, I honestly think it made my situation worse, I was separated from my family, constantly dealing with anxiety and had a couple panic attacks, I was able to leave after those two weeks and went back home. I'm thinking of killing myself again but I'm afraid that if I fail again(no reliable way to kill myself, family doesn't own a gun or anything), my family will get tired of me or I'll be stuck in a BHU, with no way of knowing when I'll be able to leave. Another thing that terrifies me is the thought of jumping to my death or hanging myself but surviving and being alive, only to have to deal with being paralyzed or having brain damage but I'm honestly getting to the point where the more I think about it, the less it scares me and I have no clue about what to do, I've tried talking to professionals, I've tried taking medication, but nothing helps and I just don't know what to do at this point, I'm only twenty but I've been dealing with depression for around 6 years now, I've slowly lost interest in doing anything, I haven't actually talked to anyone irl besides my family since the end of middle school and I just have no motivation to do anything in life at this point, I just can't imagine having to live for another 40 years, going through the motions and just doing enough to survive.",1

"Last night I was in a really dark place after being in pain about my marriage for quite a while, and could not get out of thinking about how nice it would be to just not wake up the next day. I was home alone, with several prescription medication and alcohol available and the thought was honestly tempting. I realised I should reach out to my husband who were an hour and a half away, because I really didn‚Äôt want to live anymore, but at the same time I kinda didn‚Äôt want to do it and wanted help staying in those thoughts of not doing it, and of course I wanted to feel like it mattered to him whether I live or die. So I texted him around 10:30 pm and told him that I was in so much pain that I honestly hoped I would not wake up tomorrow. At 11:50 he responds with a text ‚Äúanything I can do to help?‚Äù I had put my phone on dnd because he hadn‚Äôt responded earlier, so I didn‚Äôt see that message right away, so he sent a new text 40 minutes later saying that he had just eaten and was going to bed, and that he hoped I was sleeping well since I didn‚Äôt respond, and told me that I could try calling if I needed something. When I read his replies my stomach honestly dropped. I mean he is supportive in his replies, sure, but I might as well have been dead or already have taken an overdose, and that was why I didn‚Äôt open his message. That was all the effort he felt necessary when his wife said she wants to die, and he was able to just go to sleep after that. I would never be able to sleep if he told me something like that, and then I couldn‚Äôt reach him. I would be on my way home, calling him like crazy, even sending the police or ambulance to check on him if I couldn‚Äôt get a hold of him. And I know for a fact that he has jumped in his car at 3 am when he thought someone else could possibly do something to themself, with them not even saying it direct like that, they just said they needed him. And he told me just one week ago, very strongly, that I had to tell him if I had thoughts about unaliving myself. Am I overreacting on this? ‚ÄúLuckily‚Äù I had already had a couple of drinks and two sleeping pills, so I was really sleepy when I read his reply, but my immediate reaction was that it made me wanna unalive myself more.

I told some people since I thought that other people were exaggerating about people being mean to them once they came out which I was quickly proven wrong so I‚Äôve never told anyone since. I have 3 friends, everyone is friend with my main friend mark (fake name) who is very popular and funny. The other two Jayden and Kyle are just my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù because I‚Äôm friends with mark. Every time I think of my friends I keep thinking about how much they would like me if I was a girl. How maybe they‚Äôd find me actually interesting if I was a girl. I know how starved guys are today and I just think that maybe if I was a girl they‚Äôd probably want to be my friends.  I hate being a boy and I‚Äôve always wished I was born a girl. The way I really want to act, to dress, to live would be seen as weird if a boy did it. I want to wear skirts and I want to be a dumb nerdy girl boys found cute. I‚Äôm pretty attention starved since I spend all day alone in my room without human interaction so I always think about how girls get so much more attention from boys. I‚Äôm always envious of them and I wish that I could just switch genders and become a girl. I want to feel pretty, I want to feel cute, I want to feel feminine, I want to be the weird nerd with weird interests I already am just this time in public, maybe I can be who I really am with my friends and they wouldn‚Äôt find it weird because I‚Äôm a girl. I feel like people would accept me for who I am if I was a girl. They‚Äôd pay attention to me if I was a girl. Being trans is not an option since I know that I‚Äôd never make a good looking girl out of my body or face. I‚Äôd just be an ugly pathetic attempt at being something I‚Äôm not. Sorry if this didn‚Äôt make much sense ",1
"Sorry for the long title. My husband has been planning on taking our baby away from me since I gave birth three months ago. He wants a divorce and wants to take our child. Not because he thinks I‚Äôm a bad mother, because he knows I‚Äôd do anything for this precious baby. So I‚Äôm not really sure what he‚Äôs getting out of it.  He works long hours every week so he said he will have his family raise him. That thought depresses me because not a single family member of his has come to meet the baby yet (again, he‚Äôs 3 months). They just don‚Äôt seem to care for him and that breaks my heart. I‚Äôm a stay at home mom so I don‚Äôt have any income to hire attorneys or help. I‚Äôm also originally from Europe and here on a green card, so I‚Äôll have to return home if we divorce and he‚Äôs already made clear that our baby will stay here with his family as he was born in America. I haven‚Äôt left his side for even an hour since he was born, and the thought of seeing him maybe one month out of the year or nothing at all makes me want to just give up. I don‚Äôt really want to live this life without my child, and I don‚Äôt want him to see what a loser his mom is. I just want this suffering to end. ",1

"It felt like I've changed so much recently. I don't know how people don't realize how far I've sunken. I attempted back in March and people besides my mother only seemed to care for a week before going back to assuming I was fine. I wish people saw, I don't want to die, I just don't want to hurt. How am I supposed to believe people care about me when only one of my close friends cared enough to check in on me that night I was in the hospital for an attempted suicide? When people said they assumed I attempted suicide when I went to the hospital? ""Yeah that's what I thought."" when they asked why I was at the hospital. Not an ""I'm here for you"" but claim to be my friend. It's like I'm dangling off a cliff and they turn away because they don't want it to be their issue or they assume I can pull myself up. The few people who I do believe care about me don't know how bad it has gotten again. It always gets bad again, even if I improve for a bit. My loved ones don't see that when I get dressed for each day that I am dressing in preparation for if tonight is the night I decided to do it. They don't know that I am walking around and talking to people as if that is my last conversation with them. I fully expect each day to be my last because I am so so close to the cliff at the end of the river. I want to stop hurting, even the few times when I am happy, it feels like it won't last, so I might as well kill myself so I can die happy. O genuinely believe my death will be at my own hand. I can't tell this to anyone I know without being locked up, I just have to let things take its course and hope nothing gives me that final push.",1

I want to get back with her so badly even tho i broke up with her. For the past 8 months I been on Accutane and unaware of it's impacts on my mental health. This past week I took double my dosage to be healthy and take my meds and make up for lost time. But in this I became so unstable and ruined my life in 72 hours. I am still feeling the effects of the pills and have almost killed myself in 2 encounters.I lied and manipulated the truth based on my intrusive thoughts and anxieties. I told 5 people who I never should have told this to, I also should have never said this, because of their closeness with my now ex girlfriend. I called her horrible things like a manipulator, gaslighter and predator, when she is none of those things. I just was so scared and overwhelmed by my feelings and thought everyone was out to get me.I just feel like I am stuck in a loop of hating myself and feeling not enough since I was little, but Accutsne has caused me to ruin my life, I destroyed my friendships and relationships with my now ex girlfriend all because I couldn't trust they loved me. I feel like I did irreparable damage and deserve to die. I know how stupid this situation is but I am scared by how much I have been cutting and gotten so close to suicide.3/5 of my friends have accepted my apology and say they want to continue being friends. My ex girlfriend is still not responding to me after 3 days. I feel like I just failed the world and actually deserve to die. ",1

Please.I am 16 years old, I am Colombian and my life has been somewhat complicated since before my birth, since I had and still have many medical problems such as hydrocephalus or Inattentive ADHD. I am quite limited in motor and cognitive issues, which has affected not only my social life but also my academic life(literally nothing specially maths or numbers in general gets to my mind even if I want them to). This directly affects my relationship with my parents, whom I have (literally) begged for psychological care because of all the shit that has happened to me. Sadly, they are the type of people who don't believe in mental health and minimize my problems by saying I'm an attention-seeking lazy person and useless.For several months or maybe a year now, I have been having anxiety and panic attacks almost all the time (in class, at home, etc.) and I have had a lot of thoughts about death and suicide, something that passes for my head all the time.

Am I missing something?!? As far as I know, the only one to judge and convict the sins of another is God? Why does ""The Far Right"", or should I say ""The Far Wrong"" want to play God?!? Did Paul not tell us that ""They will know us by our love""? Who asked for their opinion and hate? As a christian, I love EVERYONE! I DO believe that the LGBTQ+ community have a room in the Lord's House always! Sure as followers we can guide people, who WANT our advice. And lets be honest here ok? Jesus' ministry was not made of holy people! lol A prostitute, a tax collector, a highly trained assasin, rebels who violated Shabbat and the Torah, and even maybe a few Romans and let's not forget Paul who was a bounty hunter and killer of Christians! Considering that, this might be the closest we've gotten yet to a modern day equivalent of that true Last Supper!Tl;drFar right or rather ""far wrong"" political extremist views make me as a trans girl who wants to serve and follow Christ with all my heart and share the good news with others in the LGBTQ community, feel worthless and like I should take my life because too many people are trying to play God.",1

"This is an alt account for obvious reasons, I want to maintain the most anonymity I can while still having someone to talk to about this. To preface, I think I am a pretty good person in most ways. I love my family very much, I love my gf (yes I have a gf and did this) more than anything else and if it wasn‚Äôt for her I would be out of here by now, I‚Äôm kind to retail employees, etc etcI don‚Äôt think anybody could really guess the monster I am sexually however. There‚Äôs a lot of ways this is the case. I beg God if there is one for a lower sex drive so I can kill this part of myself and let the other parts flourish. I‚Äôve always kind of knew this and felt ashamed of it, but esp whenever I take stimulants, which isn‚Äôt often but often enough to affect my life negatively, this monster comes out and I have no conscious mind. I will masturbate to the most depraved shit without a second thought. Well today is the day that ends, because now I‚Äôve fucked up so badly that I snapped right out of itMy brother was sitting off to the side and he somehow saw my phone and was like ‚Äúis that [his gf]?‚Äù I said no and quickly tried to actually hide my phone. He was like ‚Äúreally cause that looks like her hair?‚Äù And I was like ‚Äúno it is not her but I‚Äôll admit I am ‚Äòwasting my time‚Äô‚Äù (meaning wasting the stimulant when I should‚Äôve been working). I immediately felt guilt like I‚Äôve never experienced before and like I was about to have a heart attack. He asked me that again a few more times and I kept denying it. I couldn‚Äôt tell if he believed me or not. Even if he believed me this is still the worst thing I‚Äôve ever done and he would be suspicious of me. I was thinking of how I have no choice but to give my life to Jesus or something now to deal with this horrible thing I‚Äôve done. I want to end myself and whilst I‚Äôve had some very very low moments before, I‚Äôve never truly seriously considered actually doing that until now. I realized that I‚Äôm likely gonna have some kind of ptsd from this so I immediately dropped whatever I was doing and started playing Tetris as I‚Äôve read that that can help reduce ptsd from traumatic moments. So since then I‚Äôve been bawling my eyes out just not able to think about anything else. I deleted the photos of course. I went to r/ confessions to read about some other peoples horrible decisions to maybe not feel alone at least. Went to top this month, this year, all time and none of it compared to this which made me feel even worse Yes I only feel this soul crushing guilt because I was caught, but it is genuine. I guess from my experience I‚Äôm learning that sometimes even if people are only guilty because they‚Äôre caught, perhaps that brings out a guilt that‚Äôs genuine sometimes. I hate myself and am still seriously considering it and I just need someone to hear this Every time I take a moment to truly think about this again, I just feel more convinced that my only option is suicide.

"I don‚Äôt know why but I don‚Äôt feel like is worth living, I‚Äôm way behind in life struggle with addiction, it feel like nothing work for me and I feel alone, suicide came to my mind to the point today I was trying to end myself I wish I can sleep and not wake up anymore.",1

"I have been having suicidal thoughts for the past 2-3 years and have lost hope and any will to carry on. I‚Äôm 21 with autism, complete alopecia, and a couple other diseases and my doctor is testing me for testicular cancer. I have not had any friends in years along with any girlfriend or any luck dating. I feel weak and tired everyday and it‚Äôs now become too much. I feel like I‚Äôm cursed and can‚Äôt catch a brake and have no control over my life. I took a year off of school to help find myself and I feel worse off than I‚Äôve ever felt before. I‚Äôm just tired of living a painful and lonely existence while I see everyone else having some sort of life. I feel like a burden on my family by not leaving the house much, having a job or any sort of social life. I know that my family loves me but I know that they don‚Äôt like me which makes me hate myself even more. The only reason I haven‚Äôt committed suicide yet is because I don‚Äôt want to cause them that pain. But I don‚Äôt see my life getting any better anytime soon, and I don‚Äôt know how much more I can do this. I simply don‚Äôt envision myself happy or healthy in a few years so it would be better to get it over with now.",1
"Recently I self harmed for the first time, well the first time it was cutting like in the actual way people do it.

"Hello, I am a 19-year-old autistic Brazilian, and I have come to the conclusion that I can't go on living like this. I have been working since I was 15, and now at 19, I started college, which is an hour away from my city. I simply can't handle working 8 hours a day, going to study, and only getting home at 1:50 AM every single day. I can't stand the people at my job, and I've managed to argue with all of my coworkers. Instead of just ignoring me like I do with them, they do everything they can to get under my skin; it's torturous. As if work wasn't enough, I have to deal with a classroom full of students I don't like, with ideals, personalities, and tastes completely different from mine. To top it all off, I have no peace at home since my mom can act like a bitch with me and treat me poorly, even though I bend over backward to please her. My dad only communicates with me through orders. I honestly can't take it anymore, and I don't think it's worth continuing to push through college just to finish, knowing that when that happens, I won't be living the dream life. On the contrary, I'll be even more trapped in this crappy system, working exhaustively and waiting for a weekend I can't even enjoy with friends because I'm so exhausted. I just want to end it all.",1
"Hello everyone imma bad person, I quitted my job at Walmart because I felt like I let the team down. Im going to college next month. I plan on offing myself near the woods once I get a car.

"I've dealt with suicidal ideation for a little over 2 years and as everyone in this community knows, it comes in waves. For this wave in particular it is def partially caused by a trigger from my abusive mom but overall it's just bad. I've thought about going back to old habits and just offing myself. Will I do it? No. Funny enough I'm extremely scared of pain due to childhood trauma üòÜüòÜ but it still stands. I'm exhausted and don't want to fight anymore.",1

"I know to many this many seem stupid or down right silly but all right now I need is a voice. A few days ago my boyfriend blocked me. We were talking then he hung up and I tried calling back and he ain‚Äôt answer then my dad called and I was like omg why you hang up now am stuck on the phone with my dad and he got really upset. For a while now he‚Äôs been saying how me not been able to spend time with him call and how it makes him upset.And I totally get where he‚Äôs coming from but there‚Äôs just a lot going on in my life right now. I have a friend group that‚Äôs really demanding and I have first stage kidney failure.But still them are all not good excuses for cutting him off and not making time for him but now I just don‚Äôt know what to do.Like I can genuinely see myself making out high school with him and marrying him someday so when he does stuff like this, it just makes me really sad and go back into my old mentality thinking I‚Äôm useless and that nobody cares And yes, he‚Äôs done this before where he‚Äôs blocked me, but there‚Äôs also been a time where he was genuinely seriously wanting to break up with me and I don‚Äôt know if right now this is him just trying to take a break from me breaking up with me I would like to think that he‚Äôs not because I know he‚Äôs the type of person to be straight up and say he is, but I just don‚Äôt know And he was the first person I ever talked to in-depth about my depression and how I really feel about things so losing him is like everything and I really hope that‚Äôs not the case but I just don‚Äôt knowAnd a lot of times when he does stuff like this, it just makes me think I‚Äôm stupid. I have so many chances to keep writing wrongs and it just feels like I‚Äôm always doing the opposed And the reason I say I want to commit is because I‚Äôm tired I‚Äôm tired of failing him and failing my friends I wish I could just be better and do better I have some steroid medication for my kidneys idk if I can overdose on them but I‚Äôll figure it out ",1
Thought about killing myself again today. A lot. All day. My last bar job didn‚Äôt renew their liquor license so I‚Äôm not working.

"I think I‚Äôve tried enough times through all outlets to ask for assistance. I‚Äôve reached out to my ‚Äúloved ones‚Äù and all the people who ‚Äúwould be sad‚Äù if I left with no results. I‚Äôve even asked questions here for assistance in leaving and could get no answers or assistance for that either, which definitely proves my worth. If you‚Äôre one of the three people who ever replied to one of my posts or someone who was ever randomly nice to me, thanks. I hope my kids know how much I love them and how hard I tried. I figured out that this is just what it‚Äôs gonna be and that some people really do just have it easier. Peace. ",1
"hello, 27NB here. i‚Äôm in a rough place in my life right now ‚Äî there‚Äôs just a lot of things piling up ontop of one another within the last 10 years of my life. i have a bipolar disorder, stemming from my dad‚Äôs side, and i‚Äôm left unmedicated (no insurance, no time / money for therapist / psychiatric visits). my mom died in 2018 from breast cancer. my dad just got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and it‚Äôs looking grim. i work as a store manager (freshly promoted) but i fucking hate the job. i‚Äôm overworked but paid so little. i‚Äôm stressed out to the point where breathing is hard ‚Äî can‚Äôt eat properly, sleep properly, i go days to a week without showering. there‚Äôs just a lot i‚Äôve been dealing. i don‚Äôt even say ‚Äòi want to kill myself‚Äô anymore ‚Äî i just say ‚Äúi hate being alive / it hurts to live‚Äù. everyday is painful ‚Äî mentally, emotionally and physically. tldr; my life is horrible and i was planning on writing personal letters to everyone in my life, like a closing chapter. friends, family, my sister,  my boyfriend, even people i hated / no longer in contact with me. i feel like this would be such a good way to finally breathe and not feel so much undeniable pleasure from finally being released.  i have a lot of good things to say about those in my life; and bad things to those that made my life hell.

"Recently, I was diagnosed with OCD and autism, the reason I was diagnosed with autism because my therapist pushed for a psychiatrist/diagnosis because of my sensory issues. My mother refuses to acknowledge that I‚Äôve autism and will actively deny it. She also acts like I don‚Äôt have OCD, and I‚Äôm genuinely confused on whether or not she read my psychological report which said I had it. The past week has had so many changes happening, I finished therapy, I finished summer school, the day after I finished summer school I went shopping with my mom, I found this dress I absolutely loved. She said that I looked horribly fat in it. I already have fucking body issues, I‚Äôve been going to the gym three days a week for the past month and I haven‚Äôt lost any weight in the slightest. The last thing I need is my family calling me fat, they already insult my body hair, why do they need to insult my weight? My dad got home from a cottage today, he didn‚Äôt say hi to me, but when I went to greet him, he yelled at me and told me to take his empty food suitcase(can‚Äôt remember the actual term) downstairs. The summer school I was at was attached to the psych ward I went to, and if I bring any of this up to anyone, I will just get sent back there. I don‚Äôt want to go back there, it didn‚Äôt help. Of course they tell him when I most need therapy, it just ended. I don‚Äôt know what to do at this point!",1

Nagstart to last year nung natuto akong mag online casino, at gaya ng lahat ng ending, nabaon ako sa utang at di ko alam kung paano makakabayad. Wala akong mapagsabihan o mahingan ng tulong kasi ang tingin nila sakin okay ako. Di nila alam na wala na ko, ni wala na kong maramdaman, di ko na magawang maging masaya talaga.

"Every day I think about killing myself. I suffer from treatment resistant depression. I've tried so many meds and therapy. I'm not capable of feeling fun anymore, and I rarely feel joy of any kind. I don't even know what's keeping me here. Maybe it's the fear of the unknown of death, maybe the pain I will feel? The thought of not existing? I don't ever think of family or friends when I'm like this. I'm trying to get help, but nothing helps. I'm just constantly in a massive depressive state. I don't want to feel this anymore. I hate it.

"Just wanted to share some of my thoughts and how I've been feeling lately.I just want to simply resign from everything. I utterly hate being around people, around anyone. I find almost all people to be so outright self obsessed and selfish that even the thought of any interaction disgusts me. I find that everything we do is influenced so much by others and by our environment alone that it's purely useless and futile to want to find anything you'd want to do in this world. Is it really even your choice what you choose to do and not do? I could go on ranting about this subject specificaly, but ultimately, I geniuenly don't believe it to be as such. I don't really think we have a say in what we do, if that makes sense. I just don't want to partake in this fucking world. I want everything to end. But I'm too much of a pussy to end it. Too worried about my parents. What if I'll destroy their every last hope they have with what I do? Well, sometimes I just ask myself: What if I do? What if everything turns to fucking ash if I do it. And simply because of me doing it. Sometimes I feel like it really won't even matter. All is but a moment. Everything is one. And everything is just so utterly meaningless. The lack of meaning in this world is what absolutely astounds me. Seeing what most people worry about and how they eachother, and what they expect you to do for them to accept you... It's just so pointless and tiring. It's all meaningless. I'm sorry.",1

I was driving and I just like zoned out. All i had in my head was to accelerate and close my eyes. I stopped at a gas station and cried. I couldnt do it man. Im trying to hold it together but fuck is it hard. Im only 19 and I already threw my life away. After that zone out moment, I was just thinking, if imma kill myself, why not do what I always wanted? I got myself a tattoo and its helping. My family doesnt know about it and they would kill me if they knew. Im at a stage where I dont give a fuck. Like not in a bad way but in a ""yk what?

After some weeks i heard that she started date with a guy who always swearing, agressive etc. This guy is like if i look him more than few seconds he can stab me.(Probably she wanted him Becwuse he is very tall and good looking) Its not important how smart, nice you are, if u ugly and small then u dont have  chance agaisnt them. Im learning new things every day, im Being very nice And funny agaisnt them but this not enough.Yesterday i went out and saw many beautiful girls with guys and asked myself What I do wrong??? im asking to myself that what i did to god? Why he punishing me with this? Why should i be alone forever? If my parents died now,i would live in a room alone forever and no one would notice if i died. Maybe after months because my body will smell.This life not fair Seriously,I dont want watch others happines forever.i want kill myself so much nowadays but theres always a positive feeling inside of me that i can change things. i guess im getting crazy.",1

I broke my boyfriends trust with my addiction for the 2nd time, I cant face it, I cant tell anyone, I would rather kill myself because at least that way no one will know what a failure I am and what a waste of air my life is. I dont deserve to be alive , i dont deserve anything. At least if im dead no one has to know and i dont have to live with the embarassment of my existence. If he finds out i have done this again he will break up with me so whats the point of being alive if he doesnt want me.If my parents find out they wont ever look at me the same, no one will, and i dont deserve anyone to ever even look at me. I dont know what to do, i dont know how to fix it this time.I could just walk out of the flat and keep walking until i find a bridge high enough and just jump.",1
"I tried to leave my abusive marriage and just ended up in a different kind of toxic relationship. My roommate was basically a hoarder who was more than happy to let me flush their shit down the toilet and deal with their dirty dishes and rotten food. I can't go to my Sister for help because her husband bullies me (he once made fun of my for being slapped around by an ex) and she insists it's normal and that I get over it. My Dad yells and I thought he was going to slap me the time when I told him I would not be introducing him to a particular friend. I'm in pain from my migraines. I can't stop shitting because of course my guts need to get in on the fun. Why do I have to be alive? The people who would protest the most at my passing are also the people hurting me.And yes, I have friends, but I'm not sure what they could do for me. I'm just so tired.

"This is a throwaway account.I‚Äôve been depressed since I was 10, I‚Äôve cut since I was 12, I first attempted suicide when I was 13. I am now 16, and the past few years have been filled with manic and depressive episodes as well as multiple attempts.I know I am only burdening my family. I have been told multiple times that I was ruining the family, tearing it apart, causing my parents‚Äô rough patch, etc. by my parents. My parents have always been verbally and emotionally abusive. My mom in particular always finds something wrong with me and keeps on shaming me to my face or yelling at me. Every conversation that I have with her ends in her being condescending and making me feel like shit. My parents have always favored my younger brother, their interactions with him are STARKLY different compared with me. **I am fourth wheeling in my own family.** They are their own happy family and I am just at the side, unwanted. My parents have made multiple remarks about how they do not want me, and how I am difficult and just cause pain. I remember when it was discovered that I was depressed, harmed myself, and attempted suicide. What felt like the biggest betrayal was that my parents did not care about supporting me, just hiding all of the issues from other people. They did not change their ways, oftentimes treating me worse. I have no relationship with them.At school I have no friends. Everyone whom I have tried to befriend has used me and/or excluded me. I don‚Äôt have a core friend group. I remember that I went on a few class trips, and on every trip, I tried so hard to connect with the other students, to hang out, but I was always excluded. It doesn‚Äôt help that I‚Äôm gay. I‚Äôm probably the only gay guy in my whole school. I can‚Äôt hang out with guys without arousing suspicion, I‚Äôll never be one of the girls, (only co-ed friend groups are couples who create a clan for some reason) I‚Äôll always be treated differently. I will never experience the things that other people my age will experience. I‚Äôll never be able to go out or make memories with my friends because (1) those friends are non-existent (2) everything relies on academics for me. I‚Äôll never experience young love, unlike all my classmates. No homecomings, no proms, no matching pajamas during Christmas. I feel so isolated and alone at school.I cannot feel anything anymore. I feel like all my emotions are artificial fronts, like masks, to convince everyone that I am normal. I cannot feel happy or sad or make any genuine connections with people anymore. I was raped when I was 14, and I have felt super dirty and worthless since, which I know should not be the case but I cannot shake the feeling no matter how hard I try. I am pouring everything into academics in hopes that I get into an Ivy League school, which I know is basically impossible but I think that will finally make me feel happy. All the sacrifices, all the pain I went through, all the things I lacked, would be worth it.I feel like God has left me to battle through this alone. I have prayed and prayed and had faith that I would get better eventually. I felt that every time I survived a suicide attempt, that I survived because He had a plan for me, that I had a greater purpose.I should be grateful. I should not be feeling like this. My family is financially comfortable. I have the chance to travel a lot. I have a 4.0 and am on track to be valedictorian. I have all these opportunities. Yet, I have gotten rejected from almost every opportunity that I have applied for and I know that my freshman and sophomore selves would be massively disappointed if they saw me today.I am so tired. I just want to stop suffering. I want to go and be with God. I cannot keep living like this.I am writing this from my kitchen, where all the prescription medications are kept. I know which ones I am emptying out. I will probably clean a bit before I carry out the overdose. From every past suicide attempt, there is nothing lonelier than the feeling after attempting. I plan to do this tonight and I hope this is the last time. If you have read all the way to this point, please keep me in your prayers/intentions, I really appreciate it.",1
Maybe a cry for attention. Maybe just like a message in a bottle. Maybe just throwing thoughts out there because I don't have anywhere else. My best friend died last week. I don't know how to cope. I don't know how you just move forward. ,1
"I've been on meds since I was 16, but I've never actually stopped thinking about suicide. My other symptoms of depression have decreased to the point that I haven't needed to go to therapy in years. Its always on my mind, though. I see a household cleaner and want to drink it, I hate driving because I want to swerve off the road, I can't even play solitaire without visualizing my own death. The worst part is that these aren't just fleeting thoughts. These are developed ideas that never, ever end.Does this stop? Does anyone else have this problem? ",1

"I‚Äôm pretty set in my decision and I‚Äôm not exactly sure why I‚Äôm making this post. I guess it‚Äôs because I can‚Äôt tell anyone else. Anyway I‚Äôve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts on &amp; off for almost 10 years (I‚Äôm 25 btw). I was fired from my job last week and although that does play a role in my decision, I‚Äôm pretty sure I would have killed myself eventually. Ever since graduating from college, I‚Äôve been stuck in the cycle of going to work everyday looking forward to the weekend; then dreading going back to work during the weekend. This cycle is called life‚Äî- or at least my life and it‚Äôs gonna continue like this. I enjoy spending time with my friends &amp; family but I prefer to be alone sleeping or watching tv. Also it seems like everyone is progressing and I‚Äôm not. People my age have careers, spouses, families, etc. and I‚Äôm nowhere near that. None of these are sole reasons why I want to end my life. In short, I‚Äôm just tired of living. Usually when I think about suicide, I get anxious and cry but not this time. Even writing this I feel relaxed and sort of at peace like this is the right decision. I‚Äôm not necessarily looking forward to Wednesday but I‚Äôm not scared either. That‚Äôs another thing. The fear of not knowing what happens after death has always stopped me from attempting in the past but for some reason I don‚Äôt fear death. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone is actually gonna read this post but I‚Äôll add a bit more information.Why Wednesday? It‚Äôs July 31st. My best friend‚Äôs birthday is in August, my mom‚Äôs is in September, mine &amp; another friend‚Äôs is in October. Then November &amp; December are holidays and other birthdays. I don‚Äôt want to ruin that time for anyone in my life. I also want to clean my apartment really well before I go so I have time to do that. How? My plan is to take 8 bottles of sleeping pills and hopefully fall asleep quickly. The active ingredient in the pills is the same in Benadryl.

"I‚Äôm about to kill myself and it‚Äôs kind of an hours long process. Just wondering if it‚Äôs normal to be crying the whole time. I‚Äôm grieving the end of my life, and also the fact that I had to curse anyone with my existence. But I don‚Äôt want to sleep to just wake up to another day of the same fucking bullshit. I‚Äôm so tired of my brain being like this. Idk I always thought it would be peaceful, and also I have everything written down in my phone and in a notebook for my loved ones. I have everything ready. Didn‚Äôt expect to be crying this much. Is it normal?EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone for all your responses. I haven‚Äôt had the emotional energy to respond, and I apologize for that, but know that you guys really helped remind me that suicide isn‚Äôt worth it. Thank you to those suggesting the suicide hotline. If you find yourself in that dark place, PLEASE CALL THEM!!! A very nice woman named Chelsea listened to me vent and sympathized with me and didn‚Äôt try calling 911 or anything. I was finally able to get all my thoughts out and by the end of it I was so tired I forced myself to cuddle with my dogs and go to sleep. Thank you Chelsea, and thank you redditors for saving my life this weekend. You guys all deserve a giant hug ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"As the title says I‚Äôm all of those things and dim constantly reminded of this. And honestly I just feel so bad for my parents, they deserve a skinny beautiful intelligent daughter like all my cousins. And all they have is an obese, got kicked out of uni due to low grades, and completely unfashionable daughter. I really do just have the urge to end it, but I know that dying now would basically be them losing all the money they used to raise me. I know I have to get out of this hole that I dug myself into. I know that dying won‚Äôt solve the imminent doom of explaining to them why I failed at uni. Dying won‚Äôt change the fact that I was a failure and even died one. So I know I have to live and pay them back for their investments.But im honestly so scared, I‚Äôve always been a failure pretty much and it didn‚Äôt help my younger brother was everything I couldn‚Äôt be. He was fit and smart. Whilst I‚Äôve always been fat and dumb. All of this would‚Äôve been fixable if I wasn‚Äôt so lazy but it‚Äôs hard getting over laziness and lack of motivation. Miraculously even with these debuffs I was able to get into a good uni with a foundation year, but then I completely failed at that aswell. I should‚Äôve never went cuz now I‚Äôve got 2 years worth of debt with no degree. Whilst all my cousins are so intelligent always getting A‚Äôs, they‚Äôre thin and they‚Äôre super pretty.

"Essentially, I'm having trouble wanting to be alive because no part of life is enjoyable anymore. For the past 15+ years, more than half of my life, I've been struggling to want to be alive and I'm just so tired. I'm treading water and I'm wondering if it'd be easier to drown.The more time I spend not actively avoiding this sort of cliff, the less options I feel I have. But how do I keep going if I truly will not enjoy so much of my life. Practically speaking, I think I could get back out there and figure something out, but I just can't think of any reason that would actually make me happy. Or at least get me to a place where I have something to live for, I'm actually not asking for instant happiness.I know it's the depression, maybe a few other things too. Certainly ego is a part of it because I don't talk to the few friends I have about feeling this way. I just can't keep going like this, so I'm wondering if I should keep going at all. I'm suffering.I don't want to shove my feelings onto my friends or family because I know I cannot hold up my end of the social relationship. Is that the only way to live?",1
"14FBefore I start no I didn‚Äôt joke about SA I just want to talk about the backstory on myself a little so this seems to make a bit more sense obviously not excusing the joke itself but I want to explain a little.Throughout primary school I was sexually harassed and assaulted by a boy. Told the teachers and nothing was done. (I won‚Äôt get into it )When I was 9 my former friend Sexually assaulted me . I believe numorous times as some of the ‚Äúgame‚Äù we played was very disgusting. The police was told eventually and nothing. I had got into watching YK at around 7-8 and from then , in year 8 I also had an insane yk addiction. I had strange online friends and was around alot of sexual jokes.So a lot was just normal to me and I never thought before I spoke at all.Now let‚Äôs talk about the day I made this jokeI was around 11-12 and me and my friend were walking to the park . She has sweets in her hand and this boy (around 5-6 maybe) stares at her. My friend says ‚Äúhe wanted a sweet‚Äù for some reason my thick head decided to say ‚Äúthe seductive stare LMAO‚Äù or something like that. I probably knew what that meant and I remember hesitating a little but then seeing no wrong for some reason . I wasn‚Äôt thinking abt the meaning of seductive I just said it. My friend called me out and I panicked because I realised it was wrong. I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what I meant‚Äù we just talked normally after , she never brang it up but now that I‚Äôve suddenly remembered this I can‚Äôt get it off my head. I was so lost in the head I said something so nasty. I hate myself for it, i said something that was complete against my morals.Someone please talk to me. I need to talk about this",1

I used to blame the abuse I faced outsidethe home for my SI. I held my family in a separate realm of reality. This is the truth.I cried myself to sleep as long as I could remember. Not every night; but more than a child should. There were good times but I never felt truly safe.When I was in high school I was told sucide was illegal. The state owned my life. I promised myself that day I'd never be taken alive. I was lying to myself. I suppressed all reasons my family made me suicidal and made that comment the reason.School was a long time ago. My family are frauds. I'm more suicidal than ever. I hope I'll outlive them. I hope one day I will be out of their horrific shadow. That one day their horrible words won't echo in my mind every minute. I also admit that day may never come.I believe in full honesty. Not every moment with my family was awful. But that's how abuse works. You tell yourself it's okay because sometimes it is. Today isn't. I'm not sure if they're bad people. I don't believe they are. I think they're human. That nobody ever taught them to manage their emotions. I feel bad for them because they want a relationship with me. Yet they constantly disrespect and degrade me. Gaslight and bully me. Yet I know they genuinely love me. That hurts more than if they just hated me.,1

"I am obsessed with suicideI think about it all day, every day.  Sometimes it makes me forgetful or slow because I was distracted by it.  I know it often makes me miserable, though I'm a skilled enough actor to make myself appear to be fine.  I do have genuine moments where I'm focused on something else and I'm actively enjoying myself.  I may even have pretty good days or overall good chunks of time, but the overaching theme of my life is still wanting to commit suicide.I just want to opt out of life.  I don't want to hurt anybody by hurting myself, but I'm inching toward a time during which I will no longer care if my death hurts my loved ones.  I'm already hurting my wife with my existence.  My dark demeanor and miserable attitude.  She doesn't deserve this.  I want there to be a button I can press that removes me from existence and wipes the memory of me from everyone who ever knew me.  I don't really want ""help"" or a change of perspective.  I want to die.  That's what I want.  I'm not interested in an alternative solution.  I'm not a fighter.  I'm not resiliant.  Yes, I'm a loser, a quitter, and a failure for not fighting harder.  Those titles don't bother me anymore.  I just don't want to participate in this life thing.

"What's the point of not killing oneself? Since all of us will die eventually, I agree with Mishima's point of view, the ultimate purpose of human life is to prepare for his death. I can't stand the trash entertainment that capitalism endlessly produces. In the movie M*A*S*H, people use the most ridiculous methods to prevent suicide, which I think is ironic and pessimistic. Why does society prevent people from committing suicide even as it continues to chip away at people's faith? (I'm basically a Lacanian, maybe a bit nihilistic, atheistic and don't believe in wageslaving, communism or some shit)Here is a quote, ""I just cannot believe this is it. This is life. There is no magical third act where | am the star in some fantasy adventure. I won't suddenly gain superpowers and fight cartoonish villains. This is it. This is all it will ever be. 50 more years of quiet, drab misery. Our one shot at consciousness is spent on something so unimaginably boring. My 'gift' of sentience is spent wageslaving, consuming media, messing around with hobbies that will never fill the void, eating, shitting, cleaning. And that is all there is.""",1

I continue them now because for so long the demons in my head have been my only company and my only friends. The angry voice in my head is the only thing that‚Äôs always been there for me. How could I turn my back on it now? I want to leave, I want to give it all up. I would rather feel nothing than continue feeling this way so consistently.

Along with subtly changing my style to be more masculine I was finally able to look at myself and not hate what I saw.

I don't think I'll be able to live knowing that I could have saved someone's life but instead I contributed to her suicide. Is there anything I can do? She said that she will kill herself as soon as she comes home (2 days). She doesn't care about anything in the world like her parents, family, religion or the impact it will have on others.Is there anything I can do to save her?",1
"i dont want this , i dont want to live this i dont want to be this, this id so disgusting and im so tired and sad, im tired of dealing with trauma after trauma, tired of dealing with all the shit, i just need a fuckin break, ill do it as soon as i get the opportunity.",1
"Today I cleaned my stuff so it will be easier to throw it all away once I'm gone, and I found some extra pills.I have 40 of haloperidol 1mg118 of Lithium carbonate  300mg71 of Chlorpromazine hydrochloride 25mgIf I take it all at once, is there a chance I could die? Overdose would be a lot less violent than what I had planned.",1
I took a lot of fluoxetines last night and haven't eaten since. iim shaking when I try to walk and have high temperature and frequent chest pains,1

"I'm convinced that everyone's tired of me and only staying with me for pityI don't know where else I can turn to, I came back here, and all I ever understood was just nothingSo I'm planning on killing myselfNot gonna pussy out this timeOr if I do I'm just gonna self harm, either one is better, because in this world I'm hated or aloneFuck it's both now actually that I mention it",1
"I just took 20 pills of 2,gm temesta and a tiny bit of alcohol, shod I go to the clinic ? Thanks",1
"Sorry if this is poorly written I really don't think It does, I was extremely depressed and thats standard to be honest, I've never had anything diagnosed so I don't know if I'm depressed for sure. This attempt happened months ago by the way and I'm not sure how I've been feeling since. For starters it was a normal day, my girlfriend at the time had broken up with me a few weeks before and I was losing my mind, id been severely unwell mentally before we got together by the way ( id wake up every day and my first thought would be suicide and I was snapping and changing moods constantly) but when we were together I was worse I would go completely numb and then start burning and hurting myself. I'm only stating this because I want it to be known it's not a sudden thing for me to feel like this. But yeah it was a normal day and I had an exam the next day and I was upset about the breakup, I just had a headache so I took some pain killers, about 2 then I just finished of the packet. These packets had 8 of them in, then I had another packet, and I'm not sure I cant remember now but I think after that I had either one or two more packets of that and then I had another one or two  packs of some random pills I found that said something about pain release in the body not the head so I swallowed them and my thought process wasn't I want to die, it was more so I'ma just keep eating these and if I die I die I gues it doesn't matter. And then I sat in my bed all night thinking and I didn't really want to die anymore but if I do its fine and I won't have to worry about anything, I then proceeded to constantly throw everything up ( not on purpose ) and then I had my maths exam and wanted to die even more. I'm really confused about the whole thing and just need an opinion on if this was an attempt or just me wanting attention of being stupid ",1

"I‚Äôve dealt with some depression and other things like chronic pain for years now and it never seems to let up. Meds don‚Äôt really help me for pain, I‚Äôve been on and off a variety of different meds for mental health and they really don‚Äôt help me at all. I never feel joy or happiness really. I‚Äôm just kind of numb to everything. I can‚Äôt do it because of my kids, knowing that would be a huge source of trauma for them as well as abandoning them. I have a few diagnosis that are life long and will never go away. I don‚Äôt have friends and my family circle is very small. I just see myself as a disappointment and a burden to those around me. Living and being alone now really does not help at all, but I don‚Äôt feel a connection to others. Has anyone beat their depression actually? What made you want to live? Thanks for reading this.",1
"Feeling comfortable around your coworkers doesn't mean they care.Remember your failed attempts to reach out and connect with them more personally. (Spotify, axe throwing, etc...) Remember how they respond positively in person but never have anything follow through once people punch out? She always seems exhasperated or stressed when you try to talk to her face to face. The only positive engagement that felt safe was after you gave that old gift to her as a surprise. Following up on the favor she offered in return in the moment, you just feel like she'd rather not be talking. Oh. And shes also not interested in being friends. Neither of them are. The impression youre worried about having made is probably exactly what they're both thinking. If not that then something's off, dont forget about that weird barrier that hangs in the air between you. Dont let the shred of peace and contentment that your meds have have you fooled. Its a side effect. It never lasts. Give up. No one actually cares or wants you around. Any outreach that may come is just the subconscious reaction to a change in staus quo. Theyll adjust soon enough and itll be fine because no one actually cared to bother trying to stop it. Remember how much better you felt when youd settled in to accepting things weren't over, they never began. It still hurt once the meds wore off but at least you dont feel stupid for falling for the ""maybe i was wrong and we can be friends"" trap when the meds were in your system. Theyre friendly. Not friends. Friendly is as far as it goes and thats fine. When youre in your right might you actually have healtht boundaries and perspective on attachments and that self reliance makes everything okay again.You just gotta step off the pendulum again. And this time, dont get too ahead of yourself and jump back on the instant some delusion gets your hopes up for ever being something more to someone. Remember the moment you physically flinched when youd seen a stranger hug a girl with such genuine care and joy in his eyes. Hold on to that because breaking your own heart is the only way youre gonna keep from fooling yourself again with wishful thinking. ""We tried. Just not cut out for the ""friend"" stuff"". How many fucking times do you have to wash rinse repeat this lesson all over again with different faces and names just because you think ""maybe this will be different.""You fucking idiot. Just grow up. People dont always get close and you always said you want to be loved organically and not force your way into anyones life. ""So im not going to ask to be a part of someones life"" right? Fucking stop moping about licking your wounds when nothing is going to change for it then.Pathetic. He's not coming back.You're not getting closure, or an explanation, or anything. You're left with gifts ungiven, a heart &amp; friendship that is as unwanted as you, and yet another mystery left in place of a person to have up and left you.Because you were fooling yourself to think they were ever there to begin with, let alone stay.Dont listen to the side effect or anything anyone says. No one cares. You dont matter. Lock up those walls already bc the longer you keep holding on to nothing the more youll hurt yourself ",1

yesterday i planned my suicide and nearly went through with it but backed out at the final moment. i stopped because i hoped that my pain was just temporary because i get intense impulsive suicidal thoughts and usually feel a lot better after waiting it out but i now regret not finishing myself off sooner. earlier today i found out that my grandad is now in hospital and most likely won‚Äôt make it out alive. i should‚Äôve ended everything yesterday so i wouldn‚Äôt have had to deal with the news today and with the pain of losing another close family member. i really want to go through with it now but i don‚Äôt want to hurt my family by having them grieve 2 people at the same time. i honestly don‚Äôt see any of my pain ending; if it got even worse this time then it has the capacity to get even worse than it is now in the future. the only thing stopping me from doing it right now is my fear of being labelled as selfish and weak. i am mentally and physically weaker than most people and even though me and him weren‚Äôt extremely close it still hurts me a lot to know that he‚Äôs probably going to die within the next 24 hours. ,1

What i should do when all the doors are closed..lost my dearest person and having all these feelings which made my life unbearable ,1
"i just don't know how long i can go on like this. everyday is a matter of trying to outpace my own head, and on the days i can't run fast enough it feels as though my world is crashing down around my ears. i just... don't see how anybody can survive this thing long term. i can't get treatment for it because i'm too terrified to even try, i can barely even talk about it with anybody because i barely understand what's going on myself and half the time i have no idea what's real and what is some terrible invention of my brain. i'm trapped in this nightmare world that nobody else is able to see or comprehend, and the terror, even on a good day, is the worst thing i have EVER experienced. seriously, i've got enough mental health problems to fill a fucking psychology textbook, not to mention the audhd and all the shit that brings with it, and yet ocd (for me, at least) is still the biggest monster of them all.how do you fight off pretty much every single thought you have? how do you exist in a mind that exists to destroy itself? how can a person possibly survive, let alone enjoy, a life that will likely be spent in an endless fucking loop of the same old fears? how can i possibly fucking escape this without cutting short the only life i'll ever have? i really, really, really want to live. i want to be here with every fibre of my being and yet i don't see a way to make that happen without sacrificing my sanity. i just don't know what to fucking do and as is the case for most mental health problems, there are no answers, no cures and no escape routesanyway, this was entirely pointless, but if you read it then thanks, i guess. sending my love to everybody. whatever it is that brought you to this subreddit i hope it gets better for you",1

"It is getting really hard to resist killing myself. Basically the only thing stopping me is the pain it will inflict literally on myself and the pain it will inflict on my family and friends, although that too is slowly not becoming a problem in my psyche.I had a girlfriend for almost a year. We had been friends ever since we met in 7th grade and I had loved her, or felt like it, practically since I met her. We dated once before our freshman year, but I broke it off due to some personal issues I had. We didn't talk much but were still friendly until our senior year, where we became closer again. Her boyfriend cheated on her near the end of our senior year and a couple months later I asked her out, and we were a really happy couple with a great summer full of memories (ish I will explain later). The problem came when we had to go to separate schools for college, over 3 hours away from one another. To make a very long story short, she found somebody else at her school after we had grown apart emotionally due to an argument we had over having kids (which had us mention breaking up), and she became very close with this guy during April and broke up with me because she didn't want to hurt me any longer by dragging me along in the emotional turmoil. It really, really hurt me and I still have not recovered from it at all. But this is not even the main problem in why I am wanting to escape.My main problem in life or with life is that I have practically no memories. I can't remember what growing up was like very well, I know it just happened. I know I did well in school but I can't remember my classes at all and only a select few of my teachers' faces and names. I can't remember family vacations at all, what we did or when they happened, even when I am shown pictures. I know my friends exist but it would be hard for me to describe their features or interests to someone, and I honestly can't remember any of the times we hung out except for the two that occurred in the past year, but there were obviously more than that. I do not want to keep living like this. There is no value any doing anything if I'm not even going to remember it. It's hard for me to recall what I did most days, even the next day it's hard for me which I don't think is normal. I can't resist wanting and wishing I could live in the past again either. I do feel like I was much happier back then - I really loved school, it was predictable and simple and there was time to socialize with people without it seeming forced. I just have no interests now and I can't even remember what my interests were when I was a kid. Any time I do try and get myself out of this mental slump it just feels so fake because I know how unhappy I am and how badly I just want it to end. Life's possible experiences have no meaning on me when I know I'm probably not going to remember them. Someone please give me advice or something. I am really trying to want to be here but it just seems so pointless. ",1

"I have no plans, but I do have ideation. I have chronic moderate or higher depression and anxiety. I can‚Äôt remember my official diagnosis. I stopped taking my meds a couple months ago because I had some elevated liver enzymes when I had to go to the ER for something unrelated.I‚Äôve been doing pretty well overall, but I just feel like a loser and very little in life ever brings me joy any more.I spent through life savings keeping the family afloat after I got squeezed out of a dream job at the beginning of the pandemic. I haven‚Äôt been able to find a similar job since and now I‚Äôm switching careers by going back to school.My two step kids are very stressful. They both have ADHD and have serious problems in school academically despite us doing everything we can to help. They constantly make messes around the house for me to clean up because they won‚Äôt do it. My stepdaughter has become incredibly defiant to where she refuses to clean her room, do homework, or even take her medication. My wife and I haven‚Äôt been intimate more than once in the last two years because she didn‚Äôt want to be touched while pregnant and frankly since my son has been born everything in the house is my responsibility and it‚Äôs distressing. Neither her nor her kids will ever clean up after themselves and if I don‚Äôt do it all the house looks like a dump. I had a job until a few months ago but I quit because it was causing me health issues and the schedule almost lead to us getting divorced. That‚Äôs another thing that hurt my marriage, I was never around for 10 months because of the schedule.I just feel totally ineffectual as a parent, like I‚Äôll never earn enough money again, I‚Äôll always be everyone‚Äôs fucking butler, and any joy besides my son has been sucked out of life.This morning I found myself wondering if my son is old enough to remember me and eventually miss me. What do I add to my kids lives? I can‚Äôt provide financially any more, they don‚Äôt value me or anything I have to say, they don‚Äôt listen to or respect me. My wife has no problem not pitching in on anything with the house despite working a desk job (couch job) from home. If I died, her parents would take care of her and my son would be okay. I just feel like I have no place, I don‚Äôt belong, I‚Äôm not valued by anyone, and life is so painful where it was once hopeful and good. It makes me want to go lay in a snow bank, or go lay down in the desert and just die. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll do it, but the thought is there. I hate what my life has become.",1
I want to die so bad. I am scared I will be punished by God if I do. I‚Äôm not even a religious person at all. But deep down I can‚Äôt help but wonder if I will go to hell if I kill myself. It feels so selfish. I am tired of being here. I‚Äôve tried four therapists and multiple different medications. I am unfixable. ,1

"I've been living with depression since 2016 but I've always suffered from homophobia and bullying for years and years, and I've always thought about the possibility of suicide. This year my father and grandmother died a month apart and my five-year relationship ended precisely because I don't have any kind of long-term goal and my ex expected me to get better but that didn't happen. Before you say I should try something, yes, I have. Therapy didn't really work for me, it only exposed my obvious traumas but knowing about my traumas doesn't help at all. I'm poor and public psychiatric treatment in my country is very difficult to get. I've tried exercise and I never felt good doing it, the only thing I felt was tiredness. Staying away from my cell phone and the internet didn't help either because real life was just as shitty as online life. The only thing that held me back were my friends and my mother, but unlike me they have the will to live. If they want to stay alive, that's entirely their problem. I'm not obliged to go on living this shitty life just because of them. They're not going to improve my life and I'm not going to improve theirs.

everyone says to reach out if you‚Äôre struggling.  i have been dealing with suicidal thoughts for over half my life and reaching out has never done anything but push people away. most recently my bf. i feel like im all alone. no one wants to hear my problems or help me. i‚Äôm forced to deal with my trauma all alone and just be told i need to go to therapy and to be medicated. im sick of it. i just want one good thing to happen to me but all i get is piles of shit and then everyone expects me to be happy while i‚Äôm suffering.,1
"Writing this for myself, because I am up at 4am  and can‚Äôt do anything else because of the pain. I have severe stomach pain, it feels like so many things, intense cramping, intense pressure (like someone is punching the shit out of my stomach), a stabbing feeling in my upper stomach, with a sinister side of gnawing, aching pain. I feel nauseous, I am on nausea meds that repress vomiting but don‚Äôt stop me from feeling nauseous every minute of every day, dry heaving over and over. I am on every prescription strength anti acid and stomach coating medicine. I have been in this pain for over a week with no respite and to the er twice, no answers. Maybe it‚Äôs ulcers, maybe it‚Äôs something else, wtf knows. My continuous birth control, meant to stop my debilitating period pain, has also stopped working this month. I have pain on top of pain on top of pain and I can‚Äôt take it anymore. I spend all day crying, desperate for any med and position for me to be comfortable and nothing but agony. For years I was bedridden by period pain and given no answers, for another year I struggled with severe gastritis. I healed‚Ä¶sort of. It keeps crawling back until this week I have been hit with the most intense, long lasting pain of my life. I am on the strongest sleep meds and it can only get me a couple hours sleep, I barely eat. I have always been passively suicidal, but have never been so close to actually killing myself in my life. How the fuck am I supposed to stay alive days, weeks, who knows how long while the medical system has their dicks in their hands. I can‚Äôt take another minute of this pain. I am done! I am beyond fucking done! I just want the pain to go away and to sleep forever. There is nothing in life worth living through this fucking torture. I just want to fucking die!",1

"Has anyone here tried offing themselves by hanging and failed? I can only imagine how traumatic such a failed attempt would be and I am not expecting anyone to open up on that topic.It's just that I have been struggling with suicidal thoughts  for months now. It only intensified a month ago when my depression and overall situation got unimaginably worse. Sometimes thinking about ending my life gives me some sort of comfort, probably a feeling of being in control of at least ending everything if I want to. When wondering about how I'd do it, I always end up with the thought of hanging myself. I am just too cowardly to jump off a height, my prescribed meds aren't lethal and I live in a country where guns are restricted.

She dissapeared again the other night, when she came back the following morning with a large bump on her head and a bruised hip, i filled with rage, grabbed what i could see, chucked it in a bag and told her it was over and walked out of the door.One of the issues is we are in a very poor financial position, she has spent so much money on booze its insane, i cant believe i didnt realise how much, so stupid of me!

It was clear to me that I was nothing more than a liability, another reputation taint my university was trying to avoid.

Why the hell didn't I commit suicide that night? Well, who knows?Why doesn't anyone understand me? I hate being so sensitive. People say that I am not a burden, but life has shown me otherwise.

"I don't even know where to start, but before i talk about what's wrong with me i wanna make clear a couple of things.First of all, i need y'all to be respectful, i don't use reddit a lot, but when i posted something in the past, a lot of times there are people who likes to spread hate, even if there's no reason for it, and right now that's the last thing i need.Second of all, english it's not my first language, and besides that i am writing this on the phone, so there will be a lot of typos, and i apologize for that.I'm going to give some context, there's a lot of reasons i am thinking about this, i don't want people to think it's something meaningless. 6 years ago i tried to died and failed, after that i got diagnosed with depression and i had to be in the hospital 3 months, there i met my best friend, someone whom i shared a lot of memories and we helped each other through the years. That was a difficult time of my life but i've been getting better over the years... or so i thought.Now i'm in college, i'm an archeology student, and to be completely honest i'm not sure if i want to study this career, but i already wasted 2 years due to my depression. But that's not all.A month ago, my best friend, the one persone who was closest to me ghosted me, recently we've been arguing a lot, in fact, we never argued before, but recently happened a lot... but idk, i feel like at least we could have spoke about it to see if there was a way to get things better, or at least to end things well like adults, if that was the way it would have hurted me but at least i could move on, but no, she just started acting like i don't exist, i tried reaching out to her a lot of times to at least know if it's something temporary, to know if she's ok, or if there's some way to make things right, but she only blocked, and i can't move on, because i don't know if she's sad, or angry, and even if we don't talk anymore i still care about her, and i can't stop thinking that she's not ok because of me. And i feel bad bc i insisted a lot, and i don't know if it was the right thing to do, but you can't just ghost someone you care about.Besides these things, i always felt lonely, it's something i had all my life, and the reason i tried to die some years ago, and it's not fair, because i have a family that cares about me, and, even if i haven't got a lot of friends, the ones i got cares a lot about me too... but in one hand i just feel lonely, and by the other hand, when i feel people is worring about me i feel guilty, like i'm only bothering them.I wanna say that i already tried everything, i reached out talking about my feelings, and i'm getting help from the hospital, everyday 3 nurses come to my home to ask me how i am, if i eat, if i take my antidepressants... but it's not enough, i tried telling my friends that i've been thinking about suicide, but it's not use, the only thing i gain is getting people worried and that makes me feel guilty, i tried reaching out and talking about my suicidal thoughts at my best friend, but she didn't even respond, wich hurted me a lot more, cause even in something so urgent she didn't care... i feel that she never cared about me, and if someone that was so close in reality never cared, and abandoned me so easily, that means that anybody could just leave me the same way...I'm sorry to say all this, but to be honest i'm very desperate, i don't want to die, but i tried litterally everything and nothing worked, i just feel empty, i feel like i don't deserve people around me to worry, and most of all i feel like there's no other way out. I sincerely dont wanna die, but there's litterally no other way, i feel betrayed, i feel like a nuisance, and most of all, i feel extremely lonely.",1
"I (31m) deal with obsessive compulsive thoughts of committing murder.  These thoughts are often exasperated by stress in my life.  I am dealing with one of the hardest times in my life, cannot afford a psychiatrist to find a medical solution (despite trying countless SSRI's, meds, therapy, etc.) The thoughts are so pervasive that at this point I would rather end my life than obsessively think about hurting others and dealing with constant financial struggle as well as constant heavy anxiety.  My life sucks and I'm over it.  The only thing that has kept me going is the girl that I love who loves me back unconditionally.

But it's not their fault, even if they offered to help I wouldn't take it. It's not their fault that I am a failure. It's not their responsibility to look after me. It's not their burden to fix me.

"I've these same thoughts over and over again. No matter how many times I ask people and get satisfactory answers, it'll always come back. Something that someone said and I am hooked on to this one sentence they said and I'm overthinking what they meant although I know what it exactly meant. I have had these issues for years now. I can't control them. Being a guy, I can't say my issue to others. This constant fear of getting some immune disease is causing me to wash my hands every time I touch a surface which I'm not sure is clean is almost killing me. Extreme overthinking of the same thought and lookint at it from various angles and the obsession with washing hands and checking doors is making me tired. On top of that, the dysgraphia has made my academics a funny failure. Can't get into a career without a masters and to do masters, one has to do well in their bachelors. And I can't write to save my own skin. Life is pretty fucked. I've thought of suicide for the past 8 months and these thoughts occur in a gap of a few hours. I don't think I'll have a good life at all. I had dreams but seeing the way life is going, I genuinely don't see a way out. And none of this is anyone's fault or probably someone's or probably mine for not asking for help or support. Whatever it is, it's irrelevant now. I wish I could die by terminal cancer or by rabies or sepsis. Idc I just want something to happen to me. I don't yet have the courage to do it myself but man I wish I die of pneumonia or something. It's not about my career or any specific thing. I don't want to continue life. I'm not enraged or ungrateful to my parents and people who love me (those people are basically 3in number), but I've had these thoughts occur to me that life for me is not worth living. It's just not worth it. Please have mercy on me Lord and take me. I can't live like this being the black sheep in every room that I go into. ",1

" I will copy my full story from one of my previous posts. It's a little sensitive material but I hope it brings some clarity.Tldr  the love of my life was sexually assaulted in a pub restroom and i didn't murder the bastard who did it because I didn't know how severe it was and also i was scared of someone much stronger and now I will never have a beautiful girlfriend   From childhood, I was a selfish and cowardly person who, because of these two qualities, coupled with inexperience, down family and friends. I was beaten by my parents and offended at school, both by teachers and classmates, and I never knew how to answer. On the contrary, it began to seem to me that my bitter experience allows me to offend others, to take everything from life. I was very wrong, but definitely karma will bite me for this. My bad character and my grotesquely disgusting appearance (my left eye is lazy) led to the fact that I was fatally deprived of female attention and jealous of the men in my environment who drowned in it. Therefore, when on August 14, 2021, the most beautiful girl in my life, whom I had known for three years, invited me on a date herself, confessed her feelings to me and kissed me, I was the happiest person in the world. She was special. The most beautiful woman, dyed red hair and played rts videogames and watched anime, even let me touch her and seemed to want sex with me. However, in 48 hours everything turned upside down.  I witnessed the horrendous harassment of her on August 16th and did nothing. The rapist, our former friend, stood up and towered over her began to somehow strangely demand a kiss from her when we gathered for, as it seemed to me then, the most ordinary drinking party. I felt that she was not comfortable, but then I had no idea how bad everything was. I was too frightened by a physically stronger man to stand up for my beloved, especially since we had not officially dated yet. My God, I should have intervened already then!  The next morning, on August 17, I received a message that if I stood for her, she would have thought whether we should date or not, and since I did not see this, she does not see the point. I sobbed nine times after this message. I'm ready to cry over her right now  too.What I didn't know at the time was that shortly after the kiss-demanding incident, he followed her to the restroom and started molesting her. Very bad. I even continued to communicate with this bastard for some time, not knowing the whole story. I learned about the whole picture only a week later, when we met with her in the same company on other friends birthday party (but without the rapist). It was a very difficult conversation and I made a mistake in it, my stupid head. I said complete nonsense and selfishly tried to cling to any little thing, somehow trying to rehabilitate myself, but this only hurt my beloved more. When I tried to promise that I would behave differently if I had known the full story or next time, she started making fun of me. Fucking hell. I cut off all contacts with the assaulter that same evening I had learned the full story, and he was still surprised, he said, ‚ÄúWhy does it bother  you? Fell in love with her? ‚Äù, To which I answered in the affirmative and sent the bastard to the Blocklist, after which, in the spring, I began to talk about his atrocities to the girls in our common institute. Although it hardly mattered, it was our last year at the university.  Somewhere in February, I blocked my beloved everywhere I could, because I realized that my feelings for her were not mutual and having her in my contact list, I only hurt myself. I hoped that I would forget it. Not at all. With a red-hot iron, her image is burned into my brain, heart, in my eyes. My mind is clouded, I feel disgust, shame, regret, depressive sadness, I want to cry forever. I thought that the gym and the study of foreign languages would somehow distract me from the manic desire to end a meaningless life in which I would never again touch the most beautiful and nicest woman on the planet. I began to hate my own sexuality and gladly would have self-castrated myself.Even right now I pendulum from asexuality to wanting to fuck everyone, anyone at the first given chance. I wish this had never happened.I want her back. More than anything in the world. I failed her. Now I have no one and nothing. My reputation is also ruined because she told everyone what happened. So now even if I wanted to find another girlfriend, I will never be able to because none would trust a coward such as myself.It was my first time dealing with such situation and I just froze.I wrote to my beloved and asked her forgiveness. She doesn't blame me, but when I said that I was ready to do everything for her safety for free, she said ""no, but thanks for the offer."" I wrote that I understand that she does not trust me, but suddenly yes, and that this is the first time in my life this has happened, to which she said that in any case I am glad that everything is fine with me and I wrote to her. I wrote her a paragraph that she gave me a lot of good emotions and this topic is difficult for me, and I want the best and make sure that everything is fine, she replied with one line ""have a nice day"" I wrote ""you too"" and deleted the chat.I am very sad that she does not trust me and does not see me as a reliable person. She doesn't have to date me or anything, but her not trusting me hurts so much. Like a knife in the heart. I didn't do it on purpose, I panicked because it was the first time. It makes me cry and want to die so much. Even if at some point I wanted to settle for someone else (I will never be nearly as happy as with her), I won't be able to because she told everyone what happened and news in Baku spread like forest fire. He ruined my life. She was redhead and beautiful and thin. she has more energy than all other girls i know combined. Now antidepressants and porn killed my own male performance and I doubt I will ever have a normal romantic and sexual life. I have high prolactin and tsh.He ruined my initiation in adulthood,my love and my life. I will be killing myself shortly because I cannot live in a world as s single person without my beautiful girl.",1

"I'm so tired. I've been 'sick' for the past 8 years, I have various food intolerances and leaky gut. That shit straight up sucks all energy out of me. There is no day were I feel truly fit or 'awake'. I'm 26 years old but I feel like I have been laying on my deathbed for almost a decade. There is so much that I want to do and experience. But my body acts as a prison. Each day feels like a struggle. I have many friends that are very supportive. Yet this does not take the burden off my shoulders. My body feels so heavy, I'm so tired. I don't know how much longer I can take this. And yet I'm too afraid to tell the people around me what I truly feel. What difference would it make? I don't want them to be stressed out because of me. I've been in therapy for the last maybe 5 years or so, which probably helped quite a bit in keeping me alive. Thoughts of suicide keep reappearing in my head. I'm always looking, thinking, searching for solutions to my problems, but there is no definite solution. ",1
"I've had enough of allthis bullshit. but if I'll kill myself, I'll be seen as ungrateful, selfish, all that shit... and in case i fail, everyone's gonna hate me. it will be even fucking worse than now. i just want to fucking die. i wish like a car would hit me, or a train. some accident, so noone will hate me. i just want this shit to be fucking over",1
Im addicted to porn. I masturbate heavly. Yesterday i went to eat with some classmates. One of them is a mom. Her boobs was big. I got hard. I think she noticises me watching her. I feel realy ashsmed and guilty. How could i look lustfully to her. Im a virgin and lustfull for sex. I cant go to hooker i have std anxiety. I cant gave a gf im not good looking no money and cant commit to relationship right now. I dont want to use a girl only to have sex. Just let me die. I cant anymore. Im scared to become a monster. I cant do that to woman. I have a rope in my car. In case i cant hold this lustfull urge anymore.üòî,1
"I'm tired. I completed HS, and university and now got a job after 6 months of unemployment. Yet, it feels like I'm never good enough. Got told off by my family, seeing that I was being a problem cause I didn't talk to people I refused to be friends with due to not favouring casual racism and comments on my body. I have to be on eggshells talking to coworkers unless I want to risk getting laid off from my first-ever job. My family doesn't give a shit about my undiagnosed mental conditions and just says 'See a professional' like it's a bandaid solution. If I could I would have years ago, but I'm broke asf. As soon as I show that I'm hurt they start to act all ""caring"". Fuck everyone and everything, who claimed to love me to only backstab me when it's convenient. I'm used to dealing with this shit growing up that it never fazed me, my mistake is being a fool thinking it would get better or things would change. I hope that one day when I go to work or any moment my life will be taken away. My life deserves to be taken from me the most than a child born with an incurable disease to be shortlived. Being an invisible person my whole life, I doubt I would be missed.I am just a shadow that gave up wanting to be seen.",1
I did not lie and yet I am accused of lying (Our argument was just about her hearing the wrong number of my bank acc and she thinks Im the one who said it wrong. SEE HOW THIS PROBLEM NOT THAT SERIOUS? She threatened to hurt me again physically for defending myself and correcting her.)  now she wants me to travel everyday for 5 hours to go to college because I was disrespectful but I just defended myself. I am struggling to finish my schoolworks when I am staying near my college and now how am I suppose to finish them if I travel 5 hours per day tired and have 2 hours of sleep per day. If I fail any subjects I will lose my partial scholarship and I do think I will lose it if I do this. I think dying is an option now my brother finished his bachelor's last week after being a problem child who stopped school for years. And she acts like I did worse than ny brother everytime I try to defend myself. Once I am gone she won't need to pay my misc fees in school and wont have any more liabilities except my funeral if ever I die and my body is found. Ill either slash my wrist or jump of a bridge. ,1

"32F. I've attempted a few times in my life due to what I thought was clinical depression. Recently, lifechanging therapy helped me realize that I've had PTSD this whole time and was abused by my mother who probably has BPD.Mentally I have been doing so much better, except that I deal with chronic disabling migraines and, for the past couple of years, stomach and digestive problems that have gotten so much worse. Lost my gallbladder too which has been horrible to live without.Things are so seriously bad right now that I believe I have at least one ulcer (dx with erosive gastritis &amp; reactive gastropathy seemingly from bile reflux) a yr ago. It hurts to even move. I'm at a healthy weight (even slightly under), no alcohol, smoking, drugs, soda, or NSAIDs. Trying everything. Doctors just prescibe meds that make the problems worse or maybe even created them in the first place. This all started around the time I tried an anti-CGRP drug for migraine and had terrible side effects. My husband is largely great and helpful, but he can be so invalidating. He's a bit lizard-brained at times. He's admitted it and goes to therapy to work on all his issues, which I'm proud of him for doing and grateful for it.But he just doesn't get it. He still - after all these years and all these horrible things that have happened to me - just kind of thinks I'm fine and is invalidating at times about my pain.I feel so alone and not believed. I can't tell my parents because of my mother's BPD, and my brother will just ""tell on me"" to my parents if I try to confide in him.I was just starting to love life and myself for the first time after I thought I would die from parental and friendship abuse and trauma and now I cannot physically feel well.I wake up everyday with the feeling of a knife in my stomach. I have unbearable pain, diarrhea everyday, migraines, and extreme fear. I've tried so many doctors, treatments, etc. and I'm ready to give up. I have COVID now too and have for over a week and am terrified that it‚Äôs going to fuck me up even more.I‚Äôd rather go on my own terms than wait around in agony for an ulcer to perforate my stomach. I‚Äôve had enough pain.",1

"I don‚Äôt want to do it, but doing it slowly seems like the way I‚Äôm going.  I don‚Äôt want kids I‚Äôve lost all faith in real partnership.  I never wanted to admit I‚Äôm lonely but that is what it is.  But I don‚Äôt want the options to not be lonely.  So maybe just slowly doing it through drugs and alcohol is the way I‚Äôll go.  ",1

"Prepare for a wall of text. Feel free to skip cuz it‚Äôs probably a waste of time.I‚Äôm morbidly obese and might have type 2 diabetes. Last year my A1C was in the category of prediabetic; I‚Äôve gained 50+ pounds since then and am uglier than ever, and now I‚Äôm worried that I have full fledged type 2. I can‚Äôt go get bloodwork because I‚Äôm scared shitless of insurance fraud. You see, a few weeks ago I told my eye doctor‚Äôs assistant that I vaped occasionally, and they labeled me as a smoker. I don‚Äôt know if vision insurance is separate from health insurance but now I‚Äôm worried that if I tell my doctor I stopped vaping (thus making me a non-smoker; I quit vaping cold-turkey two weeks ago) that the insurance company will think I‚Äôm lying for lower insurance premiums and think I‚Äôm trying to commit insurance fraud. Thus I‚Äôm avoiding my doctor. Thus I‚Äôm avoiding bloodwork. God forbid my PCP asks me if I smoke and the two answers contradict themselves; it would get me in a lot of trouble. I‚Äôm on my dad‚Äôs insurance and I don‚Äôt want him to get in trouble either for my stupid mistake. So now that I‚Äôm scared of having diabetes, I‚Äôm scared of eating. I just ate a small portion of sesame chicken with rice and I feel anxious and guilty over it. I immediately went to my room and started crying. I don‚Äôt want to be fat anymore. I look in the mirror at my hideous fat body and cry. I avoid mirrors as much as I can; I don‚Äôt take pictures of myself anymore. Surely I could lose some weight if I started exercising but I can barely muster the energy to get out of bed and brush my teeth or shower. I shower once a week and brush my teeth maybe twice per month. My meds aren‚Äôt working like they should; they feel like placebo pills anymore. So can‚Äôt get bloodwork done because I can‚Äôt tell my doctors the truth, thusly I can‚Äôt get results to see if I‚Äôm diabetic. Food terrifies me now and all I see is calories. I just ate so I‚Äôm probably done eating for the day; too much sugar and carbs. I‚Äôm sick and gross and ugly. I did this all to myself and I have no one to blame but me. I genuinely just want to stop all of this. Everytime I see cutlery in my kitchen I consider acting on my impulses. My mind never shuts off. I wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing; I have a hard time sleeping more than four hours at a time. I hate my job that leaves me physically and mentally exhausted after every shift; I don‚Äôt work fast or efficiently enough so I expect I‚Äôll be fired soon. My parents birthed a disappointment. I am a failure. My brain has failed me. My body has failed me. I am a waste of space and a fat, bulbous monstrosity. I just need this all to stop; it‚Äôs too much. ",1
I feel so pathetic. I was a straight a student but ever since puberty i have become so mentally ill. Im so dependant on everyone else and self sabotage anything thats not me staying in bed. I literally starved myself the first week of college bc i was dorming and couldn‚Äôt step out of my room without having an anxiety attack then proceeded to fail out bc of it. My brain is mush and i cant speak bc everything i say is stupid and dampens the mood. I hate how mentally ill i am. I misplaced my health insurance card and started spiraling. I thought maybe i would get a referral from my doctor but of course when i actually wanted to seek some help i cant. No money cant get a job. I feel stuck and all i hear is my mother‚Äôs disapproving voice in my head. If there was a gun in front of me i would not hesitate to pull the trigger.,1

It should've been a big moment for me, right? But nope, I didn't even cry; it was like any other day. Heck, I've felt worse when cutting, so why not during that time? I just wanna feel something, for god's sake. Why do I have to be so fucking apathetic?",1
I have untreated but diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and anxiety as well as clinical depression. Everyone i‚Äôve ever cared for and loved has abandoned me. My boyfriend just broke up with me after 2 weeks of fights and I don‚Äôt think i can do this again. Ive been abandoned too many times and the pain is excruciating. I can‚Äôt eat or move or think about anything else. I love him so much and now hes gone too. I wish i could do better because all of this is my fault. Its always my fault because of my anger. Im so tired. Ive been SH-ing again and honestly i see no purpose anymore. Theres a lot more to it than just this. I might not get to see my 19th birthday. I might end it in a month. ,1

"I‚Äôve done everything the sources tell me to do. I tell my mom I‚Äôm suicidal. I try telling her again because nothing is helping. She says ‚Äúwhat do you want me to do.‚Äù She has no compassion for me anymore. I tell my therapist. I go to therapy twice a week. I used to do dbt for 9 hours a week. I get a social worker. I get a job. I quit job. I get different job and quit that too. I take meds. I don‚Äôt take meds. I take more meds. I try even more meds. I write stuff down. I go to hospital. I make lists. I do everything. Why do I still feel so bad? Why am I so anxious every second of the day? Things aren‚Äôt getting better and I‚Äôve been trying my hardest since I was a child. So please tell me when the fuck it‚Äôs supposed to get better. I look up resources all the time. What the fuck is supposed to help? Telling someone I‚Äôm having suicidal thoughts? They sent me involuntary to a mental hospital and put me on a hold for 3 days, not counting the weekends because apparently I stop existing on the weekends. And they punish me for acting autistic. I leave more suicidal than I came in. I have suicidal thoughts when I get reminded of having no power or autonomy. I am reluctant to say anything about my thoughts because I‚Äôm so fucking scared. Especially as a disabled person. It‚Äôs fucking terrifying.I try to get the help but NOTHING IS WORKING AND ITS BEEN THIRTEEN YEARS. So tell me, what the fuck should I do? Because I have no idea. ",1

I spoke with mental health department and they thought I was fit to go back home.Now I feel so confused, like the feeling I shouldn‚Äôt be here is stronger, like I couldn‚Äôt even do that one thing right.

"About 4 years ago (when I was 12) I started self harming and stopped that same year after I got therapy due to my parents finding out. It wasn‚Äôt a happy finding out though, I got thrown on the floor, almost kicked out of the house and repeatedly told to kill myself if I wanted to so badly. I still think about that incident daily and I wonder if I stopped self harming for myself or because I was just scared.Self harm thoughts and suicidal thoughts have been creeping up on me lately and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I honestly don‚Äôt like my life, but I don‚Äôt think I can change it either and while self harming would possibly relieve me a bit it isn‚Äôt an option because I really don‚Äôt want to experience that again. I‚Äôm also extremely insecure and only about a year ago I was suffering from disordered eating. I would fast for 24 - 72 hours and would make myself throw up, but I also binged a lot so it wasn‚Äôt noticeable as I stayed the same weight. That has stopped since this year as I now eat like normal ,but my weight still gets to me and I still hate my body.I‚Äôm too scared to ask my parents for a therapist (again) because when I had therapy my dad would complain that it is expensive and that would just make me feel really guilty. I really feel like just ending it sometimes.. I‚Äôm scared to grow up and I hate looking in the mirror everyday at something I don‚Äôt like.",1
