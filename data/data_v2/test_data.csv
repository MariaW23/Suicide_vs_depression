"my own mother doesnt want to come see me. i moved out a month ago in the process of moving out into an apartment while working two jobs an going to school

i told her she can come by tomorrow with my dad to see me and she said she doesnt wanna burden her sister and my cousin because if she doesn then they have to cook food and clean the house for her 

my dad coming over to check out a house and help me with my car and also drop off some stuff. 

she said she doesnt wanna run any errands with me and just overall says im not coming. 

shes a fucking bitch. i hate both of them. the shit that they put me through i was undrserving of it and they still find a way to hurt me 

i actually dont care that im guilt tripping my dad because he took my college education away and beat me up so the minimum thing he can do is give me money. ",1
And utterly useless except as a caregiver fir my beloved parents.  I can't see a future when they're gone,1
"When I was 18, I swallowed a bunch of pills and immediately got hit with the realisation, called the ambulance.
When I arrived to the hospital the staff were all really annoyed to see me, they put me in the waiting room with a lot of people as a doctor proceeded to shout at me and tell me: “what are you doing stupid girl, do you think this is a joke? Messing around, people are dying from Covid and you’re doing this”.

This has stuck with me for years, I wanted to know if anyone had a similar experience…",1
Im 14. I don't even have any real problems and I feel pathetic beacuse im so tired. All i want is just to die. I want to rest,1
"Burnout has nearly destroyed me. I am exhausted. Stay at home dad with no prospects/hope. I have applied for many, many jobs but I keep getting turned down. I am so discouraged. Everything is so expensive and stressful lately. I am losing it. ",0
"I really wanna die, I have no reason to be here. It feels like no one appreciates me, and I'm just a burden to everyone and that everyone's better off without me, though I know that's probably irrational. But I just don't see it. Time and time again I've been feeling like this, always telling myself that it'll get better, just hold on a bit longer, but I dont know anymore. I've been holding on for so long and I'm constantly at my breaking point. I'm at a lost right now please help me",0
"Unfortunately with everything that’s been going on recently I don’t think that I’ll be able to hold out for as long as I would’ve wanted to make sure everything is set in stone and that all of my monetary assets will be going to the right people. I’ve left a paper trail as some sort of half cocked will, everything else in in their hands. I don’t know exactly when the right time will be but it’ll have to be very soon. Look for me in the butterflies and in the fall when the leaves change colors, that’s where I’ll be",1
"Just feel detached from everything, starting to feel like I am really going crazy, like I’m not part of the world around me. I have family who remind me how much they love me, and I love them. I just feel very different and disconnected from everyone. ",0
"I had a pretty nice and comfortable childhood. And even then I knew that my adulthood would be godawful. Lo and behold I was completely right. Almost every adult with anything to say would tell me adulthood is constant stress from five thousand directions. If anything they were sugarcoating it.

If only I had killed myself before adulthood started I would've avoided so much headache. The only redeemable thing about it has been the occasional sex and drugs. Other than that, adulthood is nothing but making and spending money and being stressed out. Now I am in deeper than ever before, and even more damage will be done if I ever choose to end all that noise. Maybe the worst part of it is that the one real choice I have that's mine, the choice to kill myself, can't even be carried out with dignity or peace. 

Hopefully I'll either find the courage to end the cycle, or get killed randomly.

"Just stared at a sunrise and felt absolutely nothing.

Checked a bunch of things off a to do list and had no sense of accomplishment.

Money has brought me no joy.

Exercise barely does anything anymore.

Food has lost all taste.

I'm left haunted by memories and realizations of the past.

Alcohol only makes the memories worse.

Working only makes the realizations worse.

There is nothing left. I can't escape the memories and the realizations.

I'm trapped in a prison. Tortured endlessly by these thoughts.

Every day is a new low. With nothing to pick it back up.",0
What if i failed and stayed alive!! I have no desire in living anymore i don’t see future for me and i can’t enjoy things i like i feel chained and stuck can’t move forward i can’t handle this i can’t. when even the simplest things i can’t even do! I hope i get the courage i really mean it i can’t have one day without these thoughts i wake up every day and think i don’t wanna live! But i know the consequences of being impulsive i know that i don’t want to end up in the hospital alive and this time if i do survive i don’t think they would tolerate it. I sometimes hope i get cancer or something fatal.,1

"I'm always alone and dont see a point to living anymore. Thought I would keep busy with school and do well, but it really doesnt matter and I just dont see a point to life anymore. My agoraphobia and social anxiety just gets worse and being alone so much is just making me lonely/insane.",1
"(Throwaway acct) I (19F) don't think I can physically or mentally handle this anymore. Basically, I had been in an on and off abusive relationship for years. He SA'd me multiple times. I got pregnant and he had ghosted me before I could even tell him. My family put lots of pressure on me to go through with adoption, because god-forbid there be a teen mother in the family (even tho there already was one, my aunt). I placed my only child for adoption one year ago. The mental pain only got worse. It is an open adoption, although the adoptive parents have become more distant. I used to get pictures every other day, now im even lucky to get them once a month. I have deleted all the pictures of my child off my phone, it is too painful for me. I avoid it at all costs. I cry every single night. I have flashbacks often from these events, to the point i have had a seizure from the stress, and I believe i have some sort of PTSD.. although I can't afford to get an official diagnosis. My birthday happened this week, and it has to have been the worst birthday ever. I woke up crying, in a lot of physical pain and dizzy, my mom was drunk. I was holding back tears the whole day. Yesterday after a night full of flashbacks i resisted the urge to take a handful of pills. I've already OD'd 3 times, 1 time putting me in the hospital and I almost died, and i now have a little brain damage from it. I have things that should make me happy;  someone who I love and who loves me, an electronics collection, a decent job and a nice room. But it doesn't distract me enough. I don't do therapy as I have went through 3 therapists and they never help, just run you around in circles and drain your wallet. I don't want medication because it never helps, and only tempts me more. There is nothing anyone can do to help. I just want to die because that is the only way that would make the pain stop. I doubt that I will make it to next year, and I have constant thoughts of dying. I don't want to die I just want it to stop...",1
"Last 10 years I felt like I'm skipping on everything in life. My young years is so... I don't know how to even say this... Painful.

I don't want to die. I want to live. From what I can see life can be beautiful... Just not mine. 

First I was incredibly shy. With time I managed to overcome it but then COVID hit. This will sound bad but I gotta be honest. 2020 was the best year for me in the last ten years. I found my first good job, got masters in physics, spend a bunch of time with my friends playing games. It was fun.

Then something majorly changed. Every new day I felt like death is coming and I couldn't understand what it is. I ignored it for about a year until it got so so bad. I couldn't sleep, not a one single good or positive though visited my brain. Level of tiredness was way to high to do basic tasks on the job. I decided to go to psychiatrist since I understood that something was very wrong.

Long story short I got diagnosed with GAD or generalized anxiety disorder. 2 years of treatment and it got a bit better to the point that doctors allowed to stop taking meds. I've felt fine for the first time in 3 years, but obviously those 3 years I was absent from normal life. At that moment I felt like I'm missing something. No relationship, no strength to pursue it, no desire to chase it.

Then happened something way worse than I could imagined. War in my country. It's not a political post so I won't talk it from the point of politics. My mental declined with massive speed, to the point that I've felt again that fear of death on a whole new scale. I knew that I could be drafted at any moment and with my health problems (stomach and spine problems) I knew I will not survive on the battlefield.

Now it's 3 years of war. This whole time I see funerals of young and old, men, women and most scary - children. I don't remember who said war is hell but that person was right. I never ever would wish something like this even to my worst enemy. Too bad my worst enemy happy that this is happening.

Now I'm looking at my life with understanding that even not on the battlefield I can die at any moment. And question myself ""what my life even was for?"". I have no family, kind, woman I love, solid salary, my own home or something to go towards. Some of my friends are dead or badly wounded. If I parishes right now, what did I even left? 

This post is not about asking for help, politics or something like that. This is just something I needed to get of my chest.

I don't know my future. I know my past. I know myself. And I don't like what I am. 

Maybe I will have a chance to send invites to my best friends for my wedding one day. Maybe I will see my kids being brought to life. Maybe I will be able just to enjoy life with someone I love.

Or maybe I will die soon and nobody will ever remember I existed.",0
"I'm 15 almost 16 (m)... I am at that age where I'm learning a lot about everything and I figured out my home isn't ok... my father is always mad 24/7 and if I step wrong he explodes and screams at me, my mom is a weed head she's high all the time when she gets home and I'm finding myself resenting them both and considering taking my life because my father has raised me to be angry and an asshole and to hurt others but that's not who I wanna be...

"I’ve realized over the past few months that I have kinda withdrawn myself. I think I know why and this makes me feel weak or inconsiderate of my friends. I feel like I’m only thinking of myself bc I will just act like I’m busy and text then instead or say “I can’t hang” when I can, I just “can’t”.

I have recently found that after spending time talking to or hanging with my friends I feel bad and they literally haven’t done anything…so now I  
don’t trust that the conversations from my friends will keep me in a good headspace. Sometimes even them asking me “how I’m doing” makes me reflect on how I’m NOT doing good…and they mean well….but even little questions like that can sometimes make me spiral….

They are aware of my diagnosis of depression and I’m sure they could tell LONG before my diagnosis so they try to make sure I’m ok.  But even with that sometimes I feel guilty bc they “have” to be mindful…sometimes I wonder why they don’t just give up and let me be, it’s not what I want but I don’t feel like I don’t deserve their effort…I just feel bad bc I don’t reciprocate the same effort if I’m being honest. I used to but now it’s gotten worse…

"I want to give up. I really don't want to try anymore. I lost my relationship after I finally stood up to her and left her. Abusive or not I loved her  and spent the entire relationship trying to make it work, and now I've been alone for nearly 2 years. I lost my unborn daughter, the one person who I would truly love with all my heart. I never got to hold her in my arms, tell her I love her. Just watch her get thrown away at the 4 month mark when the doctors realised she was already gone. Both of my parents are dying and there is nothing that can be done about it. Just a matter of time now. 

I lost my ameature bodybuilding physique from binge eating and major substance abuse over the last year and a half to the point I'm now just overweight. Lost my good job because of my addictions and now I'm back at the bottom of retail, stacking shelves, and getting verbal abuse from customers all day every day because we don't have their favorite flavour of cheetos in stock or whatever. There is just no fucking point. I even lost the drugs after I lost access to my dealer. All I have left is drinking and eating my feelings away, and given how much money I'm spending on that I'll be loosing that soon too. 

I've battled my depression for 15 god damn years now, hoping one day it will be okay but it's not. Life has just gotten worse and worse and at this point it literally cannot get any worse. Everyone tells me it could... ""oh you'll get cancer if you keep smoking so much"" or ""your drinking will kill you"". GOOD I FUCKING HOPE SO. Thats why I do it, I hope it does kill me. I just give up. I can't take any more of this. No amount of therapy or medication has done anything to take away the pain of loosing my daughter. Nothing ever will. She should have been my everything, but instead I'm sat here with nothing. ",0
"I dont think I remember the last time someone genuinely returned the efforts or even seemed to enjoy having me in their lives. every relatives too busy doing their own thing so like we only meet up once every blue moon unless its the usual but even they tend to seem less interested in me as a person. I have had so many failed ""friendships"" that I just end up not caring for people anymore. In fact I would not care if society or this earth didnt exist, its a hellhole trying to find somewhere to belong and trying to do well at something.

I also cant count the amount fo general bullshit I have had to deal with over this life. yet people seem forgetful or clueless when it clmes to their own behaviour often telling me its just a joke or outright invalidating everything I say or feel thus making me withdraw from others. I try to care about the latest thinfs but I dont feel overly attached to nothing, people mostly seem to have a statement to say to me then thats all there is to the conversation, nothing more nothing less just nothing for me to go on because theyre not putting their share of effort into it.

For example I have one ""friend"" whos clearly the type that has 100s of other friends online but she has such little effort with me that I often wonder why I bother with her in the first place. She only seems to message me when say theres an online quiz or some other shit otherwise again she doesnt seem to notice that I go months without hearing from nobody. Sometimes I question if I am even real because I cant find no place to fit in no matter what I try theres people who try to get me into unfair situations or unhelpful situations theres been endless counts fo gossiping but no one else but myself has noticed it so no one else has even tried to prevent it, people just make snarky comments judgemental looks at me even for merely trying to exist in a social setting. For example I was in an outdoor store and there were two old hags in there at the same time as myself and my mum, and they were outright sideeying me and whispering just loud enough for me to hear it and they inly stopped when I stared back.

I feel like its got worse with social media because I try not to feel so bored, lonely and done with this whole ""life"" thing but when I aint got no one else to hang out with cause people have turned me down in the past even if I made the suggestions yet they would happily do things with other people and post about it online. it basically rubs in my face that they really never did care or simply they do not need me in their life. Or that their life is some how more interesting than mine. Thus leading to me feeling fomo for not being able to get anywhere and society always says its never too late but it does get to a point where everyone else my age has something going for them and people judge anyone my age for not being at the same point as everyone else.

In lockdown I tried reaching out to former classmates but only got one response and I expected him to reply but havent heard nothing since and it feels weird to message someone who got their life and he got his own family together yaknow? what do I do? theres literally nowhere else I can find my ""people"" and it sucks when O have to witness younger people being able to do more or have their own group and then they can share it online for anyone else to oggle at.

I dont mean nothing special to nobody. its fact at this point. if you arent rich no one cares, if you arent popular no one cares, if u quiet no one going to give u enough chance to socialise because everyone so mf loud and attention seeking, if you arent rich then also no one cares for you.

People just dont want long meaningful connections outside of the people they have around them, I might as well be a mf ghost as well cause people fucking act like im not part of anyones lives as it is.

The friend that message me about the quiz didnt even ask nothing not a hello, how are you? not a what are your latest interests? I thought it was bad in school but with social media and smartphones it feels sp alienating? everyone else so busy with their lives and showcasing it online they aint caring about those they leave behind. Even people that are on rhe street get more attention than myself they wouldnt dare ask me what I been doing and I cant think of nothing to say because in social situations those loud enough get most the attention and hog all the conversations so even if someone ask me I get maybe 5 seconds and one sentence out of it.

You have to actually force yourself to find something worthwhile to care about be it sports or some other stupid celebrities or movie series because it seems thats the only way people would ever have anything in common enough tonwant to converse with you. otherwise they dont care how you feel, they dont care what you doing if it not anything relevant to themselves. I dont want gifts I want deep meaningful connections that last in the long run where we check up on one another but even with social fucking media people dont put that saame effort badk make me wonder why I shouldnt just put myself 6 feet under

Eeven the arupid retarded part time job I couldnt make that last and if I did anything to try to socialise people either didnt care for what I say, the younger folk already had their own group and the manager would pretend to be nice but then snitch about me to her mamager and thus it seemed like I cant get nothing out of it anymore.

  
you have to be obnoxious and pretty to receive plentiful or active on social media. ",0

So my dad threatened to kill himself a few weeks ago with a knife and got hospitalized then lied his way out a few weeks later and a few days ago used all of his money he had to buy a gun. My parents are getting divorced cause he's an asshole and he's been really mad about that and I'm worried he's gonna try to hurt my mom or other family members then himself or just himself but either way he's gonna hurt someone. But idk if I should take the gun cause if I do he'll be absolutely pissed and will probably try to hurt me in some way but I care way more about the rest of my family so I think I might just take it from him so he can't hurt himself or anyone else.

Ig i expected to be fine even though i cried myseld to sleep every day for a year and was deep in denial. Same thing with anxiety, which was diagnosed at the same time. I thought  I was shy, turns out it's not normal to feel like dying after walking weird or having to talk to a cashier. Does anyone else feel this way?

"NOTE: I have not been diagnosed with Depression. However I do suspect myself of having it and don't know where else to post this.

I (a 16M) am struggling a lot right now for a lot of reasons. I have no hobbies and don't take  an interest in anything. As an Autistic person that's unheard of, so to fit in with the Autistic community I faked a special interest in history for months. Speaking of Autism, because of  it I struggle with socialising and therefore hate every*one* alongside every*thing*. I have really bad self-esteem issues. I want to be an author yet can't spell the most basic of words, can't think of any ideas for books and have the world's worst handwriting. However I think my biggest issue is my deadbeat dad.

My dad an alcoholic and he chose alcohol over me. My dad didn't love me enough to choose me over some drinks at bar. Only now that I'm typing this do I realise how entitled I am, but it's how I feel nonetheless. I saw him on and off until 2022 and he was always mentally unstable. He would always yell at some small random thing I did, even when I was little. If I trust what I've heard (which I honestly don't since humans do nothing but manipulate) he also hit his children when he still lived with us, before he got kicked out, before he chose alcohol over me.

All this has made me feel so depressed. I would have committed suicide by now if I wasn't such a coward. Does anyone here know a quick, safe way of committing suicide? I'd greatly appreciate it if someone told me.",0

"I don’t know if this needs a nsfw marking so if it does I can or however that works.

But im pretty sure im going to do it tonight. I’ve had a rough life if that’s how I should put it, a lot of bad things have happened to me. And for a while I thought I was getting better, but it turns out that was fake. It doesn’t really improve for me. Up and down, back and forth of happy and sad. I’ve dealt with depression for some time now. And the past few weeks I’ve sort of been driving myself crazy. I’ve also not had a good relationship with the people around me. Me and my mom have been arguing or fighting a lot despite my efforts to avoid it, trying to be better, etc. my siblings hate me. They tell me that everyday and they’ve just resorted to insulting me and telling me to kill myself. I don’t have any friends nor do I have anyone im romantically involved with. I’m alone 99% of the time. I have nobody, I am nobody. I am a living embodiment of nothingness, of failure. 

I try to be a good person. I do good things, I help people whenever I can. I have a job and I’ve been in school. I have always made a point of being there for others in any way possible. But nobody gives me the same. People either use me for money or try to use me for sexual things. That’s all I am to anyone. Someone they can use, who they know won’t argue. I’m a pushover, a failure, a disappointment, and so much worse. 

And I was having a bad day again, and my mother and I had to argue. Like the universe had an itch it needed to scratch. And now im sitting here crying planning everything out. I have no notes to write. Maybe one to my mother apologizing for doing her the disservice of being her child, of ruining her life just by being in it. And just a general note of what I’d like done with my things and my pets. I hope they get taken care of nicely when I’m gone and I hope my things don’t just get thrown away, but if they should, I understand that decision as well. 

I know I can’t talk about methods or anything so I won’t. I don’t plan on doing it in a messy way, I’ve cleaned everything so I don’t have to burden anyone with the cleanup afterwards. 

I just hope if anyone on here sees this that someone would remember me. Whether in a positive or negative light, I just want to know someone knows I existed. That I was here. And I tried. I just want to be remembered as a good person that tried. ",1

"Laying on my bunk in the Brevard County jail the man in the bunk next to me started eating chips. I could hear him munching on them as I lay there trying to sleep. He starts laughing to himself quietly as he's doing this, and while I hear this happening, a strange feeling starts to overcome my body as it seems to slowly go from my ear towards the lower half of my body jewels.

It was at this time I started to have intrusive thoughts about offensive things that disturb and anger me. I'm not sure if this was some kind of ritual or what, but it seemed like some dark magic was being performed at that time. I was confused as I didn't know things like this were possible, I just lay there not confronting the man.

I just felt like grabbing a knife and ending it because I have been on this planet for too many long years with out a romantic partner and I am in high school and seeing all my friends have relationships and seeing them happy makes me feel depressed and even I play games with my friends my one friend was talking to this girl on his phone and she does not even know me calls me a fatass because me and my friends like to pick on each other so I just need to tell someone that actually may care about me for once ,1
It's hard to be good to yourself when everyone around you is ostracizing you. I'm so fed up with being misunderstood and ghosted. I'm so sick of people bullying me. I'm sick of people trying to exclude me from life. People suck and I suck too. I just want to ***. I don't know what the hell is wrong with me but I don't belong here. I need to just die. What else can I say? I'm swollen... ,1
"I feel as if I'm slowly losing it. Everything and everyone pisses me off lately. I'm barely able to eat even when I know that I should. I'm scared of something that I am unaware of and my life has gotten so much worse. I've never wanted to completely self destruct just to feel something or perhaps nothing more than I do now. I feel so unmotivated to even get up and do something productive. I feel as if I'm a complete failure to my friends and my family. I thought I got better but maybe that was just me forcing myself to forget or me ignoring that there might be something wrong with me. I don't even want to be in relationships anymore because I know that I'm fine without it. I just think something is wrong with me and I need to know what it is. 

btw I'm not even an adult yet.",1
"Hello, has anyone else done this test?  I did it through myriad genetics, but the meds still had a counter active reaction, making the depression worse.  Mostly SSRI’s and Tricyclic. 

Any insight is appreciated. As the amount of time it takes for the meds to start working , just for it to make everything worse is a long road to go down. ",0
I think that maybe she doesn't hate me but... I think she wants me dead... my mom doesn't care.... and my dad is the worst thing in this world... I'm feeling so alone the only thing I think will help is to kill myself. I'm no longer ambitious about life tbh,1
"I've been going outside, exercised and have eaten for three straight days. I don't know what to do afterwards though. I like gaming and writing but I'm too tired to do any of that once those three things have been finished. I'm improving but I still struggle a lot mentally and physically. Medication helps somewhat and therapy is... okay. 

What I don't understand is the phrases on the wall about the therapist keeping info private. 

Like: It will remain a secret unless you have thoughts of hurting yourself/others or given permission that it's okay to share. I... have those thoughts a lot and it wasn't taken super seriously. 
""If you don't have a plan of doing it, then it's okay.""

Like, bitch! This is fucking serious! Why are you not taking any action?!

They don't give me advice. They just say try [specific thing] during the week, which... I don't follow through. When I tell them things, they're always like 
""Gotcha"" or ""I understand"". 

It honestly just frustrates me since it took so long to actually get into therapy and I can't go by myself. I'm kinda lost in what to do.

"On one hand, I feel content and satisfied with the life I've built for myself. On the other hand, there are these nagging thoughts of loneliness and a longing for companionship that just won't go away, no matter how much I try to ignore them. It's frustrating, you know? It's tough when your heart and your mind are at odds with each other. You start questioning yourself, wondering if you're being ungrateful for the good things you have or if you're just being weak for wanting something more. It's a tricky balance to strike, and sometimes it feels like there is no right answer.",0

I am 15 and constantly get suicidal thoughts. I have a good life a decent house. I live in a ok area everything is fine. But I don’t know why I just have this thing in the back of my head that makes me hate life. And I go through random depressive episodes everyday. I got close to killing myself once. But ussually people who are depressed have problems I don’t have a lot other then I am ugly but it doesn’t bother me too much. I have my parents right now so I go to them when I get these weird thoughts but what am I going to do when I grow up? What’s going to stop me from offing myself then? Does anyone have any idea how to help this other than medication because my parents are strongly against that. I’ve tried therapy but all they told me was how to deal with the panic attacks and anxiety. It didn’t help much. But I feel stuck I don’t know what to do and I don’t want this part of me that makes me hate life for my whole life I won’t make it. If I wanna kill myself now then I can’t imagine how much I will want to when I am an adult by myself. Someone please help me with this problem I’m suffering day and night. ,1

"This post may sound very dramatic, but it is my true relationship with my condition.

In my early teenage years I had a very bad period and I got depressed. The reason is that during that period I first really realized that albinism would severely limit my life, and since then I've started to experience suicidal thoughts.

I really feel like I'm not understood by anyone when I talk about my disease. I have a severe form of oculus albinism which gives me a 20/100 vision, and a slight form of oculucutanous albinism. I can't even stand at home with windows opened without the sunlight hurting my eyes, and apparently no one seems to take this seriously. I've just stopped talking about this when it happens and just go somewhere else. I also have a lot of difficulties doing simple tasks like using a computer, using a smartphone, reading a book, watching tv and, of course, driving. 

I think I will eventually end my life for this. It's something I have thought a lot about in the past, and sometimes I've got really close to doing that. I started to get psychological visits, but that didn't really help. I know that I have to accept it and that there are a lot of the worst genetic diseases out there, but in the real life it seems like everyone has a normal life, and that hurts. It hurts a lot. I can't accept the fact that I will never see the world as it truly is, or that I will never be able to see the sky without sunglasses, and without my eyes that still hurt while I'm wearing them. 

You can tell me the things that everyone keeps telling me from years, such as that I have to accept it, that I can still have a healthy life etc. I'm just not normal, and what I'm seeing isn't normal. I'm not even supposed to still be alive and got this far and I will never be like anyone else.",0
"I'm honestly just here to vent.

Recently I got into a very minor traffic accident,  literally just a fender bender, but it was so triggering for me that I attempted (and failed miserably due to using an ineffective method) . Not just the accident itself was triggering, but the girl I hit called her uncle, (who was a fucking former prosecuter) over it and she decided to make me go to court because of him!!!! :D nobody in my family went to college or knows the law. How is that fair??  so anyway I went to court, and then I had to take a driving class where for some reason the police Sergent is allowed to show a bunch of 16-24 year olds real gore of real people dying in wrecks!!! :D I was the only person there who wasn't there for going 20 over the fucking speed limit!!! :D

I also am so fucking stupid and braindead that I managed to forget to appear in court last Thursday to simply acknowledge that i listened to an old geezer complain about how hard it is to be a cop and scrape peoples bodies off of hot pavement. I'm gonna call the court clerk in about three hours and see if I can fix it today. I won't get any sleep tonight. I would've if I could've forgotten for just a little while longer.

 After that, I have to drive almost an hour away to visit some office for a new job which will pay me barely enough money to live, take money out of my check to pay for licensing or something and health insurance. I remember when I first heard someone say that 15/hr was the bare minimum of what you need to live off of and thinking 15 was a lot. It's low. It's nothing, actually.

 I'm gonna go to college in the fall, on top of a full time overnight job, so that I can get some useless degree, because no matter which major I choose I feel like every market is flooded and I'll just end up making people's coffee.

 Especially considering that all I want to be in life is an artist. All I care about is creating art. But unfortunately, I feel like there are so many talented people that mine would be lost in the noise. I'm good at it but so is everyone else, including fucking AI apparently. I told someone that I was gonna major in graphic design and they deadass laughed in my face and told me to do something else because of ai. By the way, I think that people who can't tell the difference between ai and genuine art at least 80 percent of the time should not be allowed to vote.

And the worst part is I don't want either type of work, coffee or cushy. And I don't understand why that is so controversial to say. Why do you people dream of sucking off your bosses? I just want to swim in the lake by the dock with my best friends. I want to get a house for all of us to live in. I want to have fun and be young like I've never had the chance to before.

But I won't be able to afford that, because apparently the generations before mine were too retarded to create a sustainable and functioning economic system. The same people who care more about trumps stupid ear than 35,000 dead Palestinian people. The same people who literally unironically think Donald Trump was sent by God to ""save america"". From what?? Civil rights? And don't even get me started on how hot it's getting outside. Or how they keep finding microplastics in placentas.

I'm just so fucking angry because I just got here and everything is too fucking expensive. Old people complain about prices, but you at least had some time before during non recession periods to save something up. I have nothing. Once my grandma dies I will have nowhere to live, and I will have to scrap and struggle for every dime. And I never even got to be a teenager because of a fucking plague. I had no fun. I haven't even had my first kiss yet. The world is burning, and the only way I know how to solve my problems is by dragging a blade across my skin. I can't save anyone.",1

"I have had thoughts of suicide for over 10 years now. My little brother killed himself little over a month ago, and the girl I was in love with killed herself 7 years ago. 
I understand the pain that suicide causes really well, and I don't want to hurt others. 
If I didn't care so much about others I would have killed myself a long time ago. 
So I just end up feeling trapped. Trying to distract myself just to get through the days, while also hating myself for wasting time.

"I want to give up.

I'm 15. For a third of my life I've been battling with depression. For all that time, my mother verbally abused me about my mental health. The first time I was admitted to the pysch ward, she didn't visit me the entire time. I didn't get any diagnosises or medication due to her wishes.  The second time, last time, I was put onto a treatment order to basically force my mum into giving me treatment. We went to this mental health tribunal and she said that made her realise that I had issues.   
  
I'm discharged now. My mum's acting weirdly nice, saying that we both hurt each other (me telling people she was abusive and having mental breakdowns) and that we should move on. I'm taking medication, which she supervises. But I'm so done. I don't have the strength to keep on going, to keep on fighting. I think the last straw was my discharge, where I literally locked myself in the bathroom and screamed that I didn't want to go home. But they made me.

I just wanna stop taking meds, stop going to therapy, and wait out my chance to kill myself. But for the first time ever, I felt pleasure and genuinely smiled. But I'm done. I'm sorry, but I'm done. I'm so so done. 

I guess this is goodbye.",0
"I don’t even know where to start.
I am in my late 20s and for the longest time, I have not been able to do much with my life or accomplish anything. 
A little background, I was good until highschool, I did more or less well academically and was pretty academically inclined, was considered smart and everything. The problem started when I finished highschool, I took a few years off(because of some issues) so I started college late, it already took a toll on my confidence and I felt too old and too late for everything. 

Eventually I finished college and I haven’t been able to accomplish anything else eversince. 
I blamed it all on my laziness, I rationalised myself blaming my failures on my laziness and lack of trying. 
But since last year, I really made a conscious effort to try. I really did try so hard mentally to focus on the task at hand, made small goals to accomplish, made a routine for myself. But I noticed that I could never focus on anything for more than 20 mins at most. Even though I would make a mental note to not let anything distract myself, I would find myself hours later being distracted by the smallest of things and would feel like shit for having wasted all those time and it would repeat all over again. 
I tried to lock my phone up somewhere far away from my room thinking it was the source of my distraction but my mind would still find something else to waste my time on. It became a mental torture at this point. 
It seems like I would rather do literally anything else than the task at hand it doesn’t even have to be enjoyable at that point. 
It’s like my mind has another mind of its own and i lose control of it. 
This has caused me some major distress. 

Another thing i’ve noticed that, nothing feels natural and comfortable to me. 
For example, even when i’m doing a simple task of doing laundry, holding my clothes or the jar of detergent feels uncomfortable and unnatural to me, like i’m not holding it properly or something. Everything I do feels wrong and uncomfortable. 


I just really need some perspective on this because i can’t access therapy at this point. 

Thank you to whoever read it till here.

"I am 21 and already diagnosed with bpd, bp2, and awaiting a DID diagnosis. I am so exhausted. I constantly live in the past and relive through my trauma every single day to the point that i can no longer take care of myself. i've been depressed for years and started self harming a decade ago, at 11 years old. i've been waiting for it to get better but it just seems to get worse. i've tried every single medication from SSRIS to mood stabilizers to antipsychotics to benzos to self medication with psychedelics and weed. The only thing that helped with the suicidal thoughts was the psychedelics for a few years but they turned into a dependency and i would not like to try them again. I've been in and out of therapy since i was 8. I am so suicidal and tired and feel so trapped that i do not care that anyone will miss me so please don't tell me to stay here for selfish reasons, they will eventually be fine. My boyfriend today said it would kill him and my family but my dad died a few years ago and life goes on whether you like it or not and it gets better dealing with grief. I just can't seem to continue with my life anymore. I can't hold down a job and if i do i can't work for more than 3 days a week and i'm supposed to be going back to college this semester, i can't even take basic care of myself like remember to eat or drink water and my hair is matted because i don't have the energy to brush it. The only reason i will be okay tonight is because i am in my boyfriends bed and i will not let him the one to be finding my body. I've searched plans and every single one seems to have something wrong with it from organ failure to ending up in a coma/disabled. I do not have access to guns as i am legally not allowed to buy one in my state. No one seems to understand that i can't crawl myself out of this state of despair and every time i try to explain it i am called lazy or that i am overthinking things when i have lived enough trauma for multiple lifetimes. Please just offer quick and easy convenient ways to die, i dont care how painful as long as it is quick. Thank you. ",1
"I already decided on a method, now I'm making further plans about time and place. I'm actually excited to finally end it. It feels good to finally prove that I actually am mentally unwell and not just faking or lazy. Thinking about people grieving about my death (especially my dad) puts a smile on my face. some time ago, ending my life felt so distant and improbable, like winning the lottery. but now that feeling fits more with the idea of a normal life, being able to function or having a relationship. I lost hope and stopped caring. it feels like the end, did my 20 something years, worth a try but ultimately not really worth it. as far as I know myself, im gonna chicken out at the last moment anyway, but I like to believe that I'm finally able to do it when the pain becomes unbearable. I'm gonna give therapy a try, don't have anything else to do right now ",1

I quit using cannabis a week ago. I work in a call center which is stressful, but even more so whenever I'm going through something. I keep wanting to cut my wrists just to feel a pain I can control. I want to shave all of my hair out, it's the longest it's ever been and I feel more feminine than I ever did. 
I feel like a failure to my parents. I don't blame my s.o for wanting someone else maybe. He says he doesn't but the things he says tells me otherwise. My work would be better off without me too.

"Harsh truths. Gentle truths. I need either at this point.

I have suicide plan ideas, no solid plan yet. I want to die. Hanging did not work back when I was 19, so don't wanna try that. OD is extremely difficult to do, I'm more likely to just get hospitalized for that. I do not like gore so don't want to expose that to someone by shooting myself with my step dads gun or jump off a cliff. On my list is either charcoal burning, jumping into a cold lake hoping for hypothermia/cold water drowning, or purposeful heat stroke (I'm a runner; I imagine this would be easy to do just not pleasant to experience). I know the biggest challenge is my body's natural desire to live, unfortunately.

At the same time I don't know if I am actually going to go through with it. Maybe I wrote out the plans as a coping mechanism - to know it is there in case things hit the fan more than they already have, such as my mom dying from cancer/complications of cancer.

I'm on vacation, without any actual plans. I'm just bopping around. Even on vacation I am painfully depressed. This isn't like me, I usually find adventure and fun in the smallest things and find great joy in the spontaneous and I romanticize the shit about everything and anything.

The other night, I could actually feel the emotional pain where I did not want to breathe anymore.

Some background about me: I have depression/anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD. I also have a clinical doctorate and do not dislike my job, but I'm also in 200k+ debt that will be forgiven if I die. I have been feeling quite isolated in the small town I've been in since last fall. My mom got diagnosed with late stage cancer and while she made it through chemo and radiation, she has been having toxic side effects from immunotherapy and recurrent respiratory failure episodes in which she has had 6 hospital admissions in the last month alone. I am not close to my dad or step dad. I feel lonely and I have no close friends. I'm scared of living a life without my mom. Without my aging cat. Without anyone. Life looks bleak. I'm tired of being the funny person and the one that looks out for people, but all alone once I'm at home. Silence is no longer comforting, but neither is music anymore. Nothing soothes the ache.

I do not enjoy what I usually do. I want to force myself to go out and trail run and boulder, things I love but I just do not anymore. I know these are textbook symptoms of depression. I have the logic to identify what is going on, but that does not make me feel better emotionally. I love the moon and sunsets and now when I look at them, I feel nothing. I have no interest in anything in life.

Yes this is a post for ""attention"" because I want to spend the next hour reading advice or insights to keep me distracted, genuinely. I have nothing else going on. I have plans to go through with this on either the 18th or 20th. But I also have a therapy appointment tomorrow too and yes I will let her know, maybe she will admit me. Maybe that's what I need.",1
"I'm crying out loud as I write this. I can't do this anymore. I'm so tired. My life is complete misery and it only gets worse. Nothing is salvageable anymore. Even if it was only I can make that change and I'm too tired and weak, I don't see a purpose anymore anyway. I've never lived to begin with, my whole life was awful. That's not living, it's just torture.

  
I don't have friends, the little family I have hates me. I don't do anything and never have. I don't bring value to anyone or anything and I never have and never will. If I was gone there wouldn't be any negative change at all.

  
The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want my mom to lose her only blood relative, though I suppose she'd still have my brother even though they don't get along as well. She's gonna be by herself without me, but she prefers it that way anyway. I don't even know why I'm still here or why I'm still trying.

25F, struggling with depression and c-ptsd since the age of 16, as well as with newer additional trauma from last year. My mind has become increasingly foggy and empty to the point where I find it difficult to think and articulate. I excelled in HS, got through a five-year/integrated masters in applied mathematics with decent grades (although with so severe cognitive, sleep and emotional issues that I had to postpone several exams and used an extra term to finish my masters), and lately it has gotten so bad that I’m embarrassed to be around people and struggle to trust myself with anything that requires attention to detail. I’ve mostly lost my thought processes, and am terrified that I will never feel like a thinking human being again or be able to function on a normal level. Mathematics used to bring me a lot of joy, but less than two years after writing my thesis I can no longer do it at all.

"I’m actually trying to make something of myself. I’m a housewife (cue all the men telling me I’m worthless yes I know thanks I won’t be alive hopefully soon so you won’t have to worry about humbling me-even though I’m clearly not full of myself).

Got married, went active duty military, then got out. Struggled to get my head on straight for years, got therapy, meds, thought I was making great progress until recently.

Finally I was on track for a degree and a pathway to a field I’m interested in. Until I found out me from high school apparently fucked over me today. Gpa and act score isn’t high enough for the program I want to get into so now what??  Idk I’ve had setbacks before but this just sent me over the edge. And it’s not like I picked my major mindlessly this was my third time for this era of my life and after so much damn research. After all the research and planning and my dad and grandma talking shit behind my back about me needing a job and not just wasting my life just being a wife now what?

It’s like no matter what plan I create for myself the universe tells me to fuck off. I’m so over life it’s not even funny at this point. Maybe to those who predicted I would never amount to crap. 

I’m genuinely fucking trying and it doesn’t even matter

No I don’t need a random job to take my mind off things I don’t even have to work. I want to have a career. There’s only 1 car here so I’m stranded anyway.

I came out to my brother and dad an hour or so ago, over the phone, and they were accepting and supporting and i couldnt wish for anythng more, but my mum dowsnt know yet and i am sat here on my floor waiting for her to come home so my dad and i can talk to hwr about it. ive tried before and she hasnt been the best with it, saying ill always be her little girl and howi wish that could jsut be it. i phoned in sick from work because i cant gather myself and i feel worse for coming out to my dad and brother, i wish i never did, i wish i kept quiet and i wish i tried so much fucking harder just to be happy. Im sat on my floor and im thinking a lot of things and i just want to forget i ever  did this. theres a lot going on and i cant bare to say what im thinking but im strugggling so mcu, i dont like myself or why the fuck i justvcame out",1
"I'm so over this world. why would we continue living in this dogshit world. 

Everything in this world is a fucking joke and its affecting me in the worst way possible. I have descended into this state of being cold... I've become a cold hearted, emotionless husk that can only operate at work. Once I'm at home all i do is sit, game, eat or fantasize about a better life that is so out of reach. The feeling of daily paralysis and not being happy or content even existing is tiring. Sleep is too hard these days too. iv been awake for days just thinking. Not being able to feel emotion and feeling like there's nothing to do anymore in life but to work is just shit. Its cost me friends and is about to cost me my marriage.

Outside my 4 walls that i call home, i am continuously met with a society that cannot seem to accept one another. My very religious family is always out there to condemn every choice i ever make or have made in the past. Society is always trying to convert other people to their belief system whether that is religion, gender, political, socio-economical or even food related and the pressure of being confronted by that is just over exaggerated. Now don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their own choices regarding beliefs or gender identification but just stop laying it so thick on people especially people like me. i have had to deal enough with mental pressure/manipulation in my teenage years and now that i am almost 30 i have to continue battling my way through more mental pressure because other people cant handle the way you live your life? Absurd! 

The idealization of not existing anymore or just disappearing off the face of the earth is such a calming thing. I am diagnosed with depression, PTSD (thank you military) and i will act on my suicidal thoughts (something i have been withholding till now) if this horse shit world gets worse. ",0
"To know I have to wake up, go into work , knowing I’m not happy, I’ll never be happy, I won’t ever reach that point where I could wake up and actually look forward to something, just to feel like a waste, to feel like a burden to everyone, I’m just wasting my life away, I’m taking up., that being dead would be the better option, to be off this planet would be better",0
"Hi all,

I seriously considered suicide at 18, but I figured I still had time to turn things around and I believed ppl when they said things will get better. Well, 4 years has passed and I’m in no better position now. During these four years I focused heavily on self improvement, including learning (for myself), grades(for school), and exercise. I didn’t go out to parties/clubs at all because I barely made any social connections throughout college. As such, I have no happy memories throughout these last four years. 

I have good grades, am in great shape, and I feel generally satisfied with the knowledge I know. My problem is that none of this helped me in my life. I have little work experience and as such I have no prospects for work. Initially I wanted to go to law school, but I realize now that despite putting so much effort into learning I am only above average at best in my intellect, and I can’t score very high on my LSAT despite working an ungodly amount of hours on studying for it. Because I can’t score high on my LSAT I can’t go to a good law school. My grades are splendid, but it turns out grades are not worth much in applying for grad school or getting a job. 

I have no friends and am developmentally behind in communicating with my peers, I developed a terrible stutter, and I don’t know how to socialize anymore. Recently I tried to put myself out there and talk to ppl, but they try to get rid of me as a friend as soon as possible. I have no friends now. Of course I have no romantic experience and no hope in ever getting into any romantic relationship because of my two problems above. I have been on dating apps for around three months, and nobody that I like is interested in me, and my standards are very low. Throughout my life I must have been rejected by 300+ girls online and around 10 in person, I was never ‘accepted’ (whatever the opposite of rejection is) by any. I consider myself pretty chill and I’m not some misogynistic lunatic or sex crazed deviant. And this is despite maxing everything I can in my personal life. Lastly, by reading so much philosophy I developed a value change, and I cannot connect to people because of it.

TLDR So I guess my question is when is it logical to call it quits. I have no career, romantic, or community prospects. Compared to 4 yrs ago I improved everything that was in my control, but I did not improve in any of the three fields I mentioned. Instead, now I have other problems I wasn’t struggling with before, namely being developmentally behind and having different values. ",1
"I know it's been said a million times on here, but I just don't see the point anymore. Waking up only to go to a job that actively makes me want to jump off a bridge for 8 hours, then getting off work so mentally and physically exhausted it's all I can do to just eat dinner, only to have to go to bed and then wake up and do it all over again. Literally, what's the point? People will say work to live, but when exactly am I supposed to do that when all my time is taken up thinking about my toxic-ass job? I've reached a point where I actively fantasize about just ending it all to stop the endless cycle.",1
"I just graduated  highschool and am turning 18 in a month. I have long felt upset over aging but its never been as bad as now. I cant stand the thought being an adult. I would almost ather not exist at all than be one. I dont know how i will live with myself knowing im an adult. The idea that instead  of people i see on the sidewalk or public smiling at me as i walk by because to them i am innocent. They will instead assume im a sex obsessed, money hungry man who should be avoided,  i know that is  probably irrational i just just feel like the world will be so cold when im an adult. I want to mature and want to be independent but its also a scary concept.  had horrible issues about the idea or aging when i was 15  , i thought i was so old them but looking back i realize i was just a kid. I would do anything to go back to being 15. My life is basically over  and theres nothing in my future to look forward to. And even if i find enjoyment at the end of the day i will be always old so why does it even matter.

"I can’t deal with this life anymore even though I’m a teen. I feel like I’m not important to anyone. My life consists of being grounded by my mom just for her to make me feel guilty two minutes after and my dad (when I’m with him since my parents divorced long time ago) doesn’t care about anything about me except anything related to my mom, example if I like clothes that he doesn’t like he’d always associate to my mom “is it your mother that makes you have that taste ? It’s vulgar and ugly”. People think I’m just a girl that wants attention and that is always angry. I’m more than that, I just want to be understood and loved, like actually loved..
Every time I text my friends they just leave me on delivered. I realized that all these things I have interest in, I’m just horrible at it. And the worst is that I’m also fat and ugly, I want to rip my face off. I almost got hospitalized because I would always end up having panic attacks at school. I saw a neuropsychologist and I have extremely high chances of suffering from depression. Does anyone relate ? Am I making a big deal for nothing ? Does anyone know how I can kms effectively ?",0

"I spent most of my teenage years suffering from extreme depression and anxiety, though I have improved, I still sometimes find myself regressing back to my old habits. I have diagnosed borderline personality disorder along with endometriosis and Autism. With those along with my past trauma, I never really know why im feeling depressed or how to fix it in the moment. I am currently finishing up my bachelors degree and starting work on my Masters in 2025. This summer I have been feeling extreme burn out and just feelings of helplessness. I dont really have friends in my home town so I spend majority of my summer alone in the house. Some days I find myself waking up and not leaving my bed until 6-9 hours of the day have passed. The end of the summer semester is approaching and ive been struggling with school work due to lack of motivation and other things, the guilt from falling behind is also getting to me as well. My boyfriend is amazing, but he has a lot of mental issues as well and its hard for me to open up to him because I know he is fighting his own battles right now and as much as I love him, he has never been as invested as our relationship as I have so I fear that if I start asking for help too much he will decide its for the best for us to split up. So moral of that is, not only have I really found myself struggling recently, I also have nobody to talk to about it. I feel constantly tired and numb. I could write so much more about my familial issues and other things that are bringing me down but I just don’t have the energy. With my long history of depression every time an episode hits its so hard not to believe this will last forever. I guess my main purpose for this post is just to get support… to be told this isint permanent.",0

Hello, im a 17 years old girl with lots of trauma. For context my mom (40f) and my dad (38m) have their own traumas which are connected with their own parents. half of my family has mental issues and alcoholism. anyway, lets go to my story, when i was 7, i went to 1st grade of elementary school (im from Europe, i will not say what country). My dad picked his 10 hour long work, yes he’s working 10h per day. Im seeing him maybe 10 min per day for 10 years now. My dad is abusive emotionally towards me and sometimes my mom. For example, on my 14 bday he told me that he hates me and he never loved me cuz i didn’t went to school that day. And he’s always yelling at me that he spends money on my therapist, psychiatrist and meds. he hates the fact that i have LOTS of mental illnesses. Also i was bullied my WHOLE life in school, thats why i have my school online now. Plus, im not basic AT ALL from my appearance, and he’s always laughing at me how ugly i am. When i was a kid and i wanted his help he was yelling at me and telling me how stupid i am. Thats why when i was 11 years old i started sh and i was suicidal, and nothing changed to this day. On the other hand, my mom is drinking so much and she has alcohol issues. And she’s always yelling at me that its not true that she has issues with alcohol. Plus, shes never protecting me from my dad. For example, yesterday i came home crying cuz people were laughing at me on the street cuz of my looks and overall im extremely suicidal since 1 month. (i had suicide attempt 2 years ago and i want to repeat it) And my mom was complaining at me that im weak. Plus she told me that she have REAL trauma and problems and she’ll die cuz of me. Plus she’s always yelling at me that she’ll close me in mental asylum. honestly? i have nobody. my grandma which i was extremely close with died 4 years ago, she was only 52 years old. i have enough. i want to kms. and i feel like my parents are right. Is my trauma valid or i am overreacting? (obviously they’re examples cuz worse things happened with my parents)

"i called to a crisis line and the first time i spoke to a woman for a 50mins and it did kinda help as a distraction but after the call ended the suicidal urges returned and i tried calling the crisis number again and it was the same woman again but this time she said our talking wouldn’t help and i should just call the emergency number and go there to get medical treatment at the risk for going to a psychiatric ward, EVEN when i told her before and during the later call I wouldn’t even want to risk going there, she just told me that our talking wouldn’t do anything. i just ended the call. i just wanted to talk to someone about the way i was feeling wilthout the risk of going to the ward without my consent. she did say that if i were to call the emergency number they might determine that i was actively a threat to myself and they would have to take me. THAT IS THE LAST THING I WANT. legit would rather just end it right here and now.",0
"After i (26m) broke up w my gf (23f), i feel like i became dysfunctional. i set a list of things i want to do in order to grow as a person like exercise, get my driver's license, excel in my job.

I was working along those things consistently for a month, it tapered off in the 2nd, before i finally lost motivation. I slumped. I spent the last month's worth of weekends rotting on my bed.

It's been 3 months since we broke up. This is really bad. My career is now struggling and it's very irresponsible of me to burden my teammates for personal reasons but i just can't function.

I think i need someone to push or coach me but realistically, I'm 26. There's no one to do that for me anymore. I'm an adult. 

I don't know how to go on. I miss her so much and i am incredibly lonely. I don't know who to seek and I don't want to go back to my old friends, after so long, just to let them hear me whine. It'll be as if i am only there when i need an emotional bolster.

I have already processed things and formed conclusions on how it wont work out if we were together and how she was not good for me. But this didn't help at all to making me miss her less, it only rationalised why i am here, not solve the pain. I also processed my shortfalls but my fear is the inability to grow from it and my current dysfunctionality is validating that fear. There are aspects in my life which were like this for a decade: where i couldn't grow in no matter how much i tried.

If this is one of those areas, I don't see anything good. I don't see how i can be fixed. It's looking very very bad. ",1

"I'm 22(M), and I'm in my final year in some university in Nigeria. Recently, I've been having some thoughts of ending my life. It's crazy, because this is the first time I'm saying this out loud lol. I guess I have never said it out loud because I wish it wasn't true, plus I think the reason why I'm having these thoughts is pretty much stupid in the grand scheme of things. It may sound dumb, but the reason I've been having these thoughts is because I may end up not graduating this year, and my energy for school is nonexistent. I never really liked school from day one. And I live in a society that bases your worth majorly on your academic achievements and then financial status. The moment I stepped into this university, I have been dreaming about leaving or dropping out. I study Engineering, and the programme typically spans 5 years, and I always thought that before the 5 years would be up, I'd hit jackpot in my career as a frontend developer and drop out.
I think the major reason why not graduating this year and having an extra year is such a big deal is because of the pressures I experience. Growing up, I had always been the intelligent one and people tend to have high expectations of me because they regard me as intelligent, and those expectations typically involves doing well in the university. But, I just... can't. I hate this school. I don't like being around these people. Every morning I wake up here, it always feels like I'm being strangled. I hate going to classes, I hate writing exams, I hate all of it. And I've never been open about this because I'm afraid of judgement.  Heck, even as I type this I'm judging myself. But feeling this way about school, and then having to stay an extra year?! It feels impossible. I don't think I can do it. And then opening up to my parents and siblings about my academic failures feels like a hurdle that I cannot possibly cross. Especially my parents. Their expectations of me are too high, and they care about me a lot, and I would hate to disappoint them. My parents are not the progressive sort at all. I know for a fact that they won't take it well. They definitely won't. And I'd hate to make them sad, but I can't avoid it at this point. Everything just feels overwhelming right now. Right now, it's hard to imagine myself living past the next few months. My mental health is on thin ice, and I can't really talk to anyone about this because I'm afraid of being judged by them. I just wished I didn't care or gave a fuck about any of it, but I do, and it's eating away at me everyday. Plus I have so much school work to do, but I haven't even been able to leave my room lol. I feel like a failure, and I feel like I have disappointed a lot of people who had any sort of expectations of me. It's difficult imagining a life past all of this, but I hope it happens. I love my family, and I wouldn't want to make them sad or disappointed because of me.",1

"I just want to state I'm doing okay in terms of a place to work and a house to stay at. I'd say I'm dealing with less stress than the average person working in the US. The issue is I'm breaking mentally when I thought I overcame some of my biggest problems that held me down. I use to deal with a lot of depression and anxiety. It held me back horribly and I tormented myself In the past thinking how the way people treat me I must deserve to suffer. I thought that maybe I had done something so horrible in a past life that I absolutely deserved the hurtful things friends would do to me. I'd lay in night crying about how I would be better off if I had disappeared and the only thing that stopped me was not wanting to end my life just out right sense who knows where you go and what damage I would cause to people finding out I killed myself. Even my family treated me horrible as a kid I know I was not raised well. I wasn't raised horribly but I still went through stuff that caused me to develop how I felt about how I deserved to suffer. I know it was what caused my anxiety. Even back then when I expressed my severe panic attacks no one tried to help. They even found out I was cutting cause I tried getting help through a suicide hotline who just threw cops my way so I had to get cuffed and sent to a mental hospital. Explains why I don't go there for help anymore.

Of course I no longer face this exact challenge of hating myself. I actually have grown to accept the things I like and and who I am. I have bought things I like to look at like art and just stuff that would help me. Ultimately I begun taking care of myself and loving myself. With all of this it was very impowering I felt good about life. The last time I felt depression/anxiety was 5 months ago when my bestfriend who I talked to everyday for a year started ghosting me. She had moved back home and shortly after the energy we equally put in started halting. I gave it time thinking oh she just wants to be with family for a bit. A month passed. I had grown to hold a lot of anxiety and concern the friendship was ending. I expressed my feelings of how ever sense she moved back home I felt I wasn't someone she liked anymore. Like I was just used to pass the time she was away from home. I only received deflections and how my comment hurt her. I was just shocked.

What made all of this worse is I had just helped this friend get a new pc with a good amount of money. Money I was anxious to spend but there were no issues in the friendship prior. We always worked things out we always played games and did voice chat. When she needed someone to vent to I tried to be there for her. I gave her advice helped her away from bad friends. Showed her how to be more positive and get through work. I put so much into it and I loved it. That friend felt like a sister to me that I didn't have. Just like that though I was no longer even a thought to them. They said they would pay me back first. They ended up paying others back first. I asked them about it. They said how I told them they could take their time. I did. Though there was absolutely desire being shown to pay me back. 2-3 months in no money was given back. I was dying over this. I spent a year with this person almost daily sharing so much. Now I'm not only not worth talking to but I'm not even worth getting the money back that I so kindheartedly loaned. Remembering hearing how she looked up to me so much. Hearing how I helped so much. So I guess it wasn't meant at all. Or they liked my actions but not me as a person. Eventually I had looked into stuff and my mind switched. I was done treating myself bad over all the stuff that went wrong.

I started taking care of myself and buying things for myself. It honestly didn't feel as good but I know it was helping and after sometime I realized how horrible those close friends were to me. So I started trying to better determine my friends and started a goal of staying out of friendships that had drama. Anyone who I had issues with I put a long stick between us at the very least. This horrible event at least gave me room to treat myself better. Then it started. I started realizing how sickening it was for people to treat such a sweet person like that. To selfishly use me like that. Use me as a wallet. Use me for emotional validation. Use me to fill in their boredom. Most of the closest people hurt me the most. Said some of the most vial things I had heard. It all ended on such bad terms. It made me question if I should have anymore close friends. Shortly after someone who I considered a friend started trying to make me mad. I knew what they were doing cause they started instigating things. They even expressed how they were trying to instigate. I can't just leave this friend because a good friend hangout with him. I'd have to leave as a whole.

All of these little details all of these little actions that I saw in people. I saw how sickening we are as Humans. We steal from people who love us. We use them like tools. We do anything to make ourselves feel better even if it means someone dies. What was unbearable an amount of depression and anxiety is now an unbearable amounts of anger building up more and more. I knew how everyone close to me treated me so disgusting. No one sacrificed anything for me. No one did anything that was at their inconvenience. No one in this world wants to be understanding. No one wants to put in the same effort all the time. My friend group is getting smaller and smaller. I don't make anymore friends. So it just seems like a painful process of me losing all my friends in some disgusting way eventually and I'd have no way of know sense most just switched up on me. Where they take advantage of me or use me in any kind of way. Where at the end of it my health is never a concern to them. Its disgusting how much stuff I dealt with that was horrible as someone with such a big heart.

Now I don't know who to trust anymore. I don't know whos going to toy with me next. I know I can't make any friends not that I don't talk to people but because I'm such a different person from everyone else. My interests are niche and very few people ever know them. No one really gets my way of joking a lot and Im so spastic. I have a lot of energy and I just act dumb because its fun. I don't hate me for this but I know the way I am doesn't bring anyone in which as a human is making me feel very lonely. So while I'm losing people there is absolutely no one showing up in life. I'm growing up and I know less and less people will like my way of joking and interests. Its just saddening cause I use to love people and I wanted to give someone the most a human could. I wanted to experience true love. The closer I got to this it felt like life was stabbing me in the most painful way it could. People I thought I knew who lured me in only to use me and throw me away.

So despite wanting to love people and care for people and help I now Just feel so much disgust and hatred. I'm so full of anger and it gets worse everyday. I stay physically active to hopefully burn off this anger but I can still feel it there. Even if I manage to get it out of my mind during it comes back. Its just there. I'm so disgusted by what Human do. It feels like truly humanity was never full of love. It was never a place with good people. I just hate how no one cares. Whats the point. Whats my purpose. I just want to say fuck it and leave everything. I don't want to deal with this shit anymore. Getting close to someone just means a big chance at me getting screwed over in some way. I don't know how to feel or what to do now. everything is just feeling worse. I just feel like blowing my brains out. There is no good here. I won't even feel that happiness i did from friends in anything else and I've been trying. I want to be happy but I can't find anything to distract me away from this anger like those friendships did. I love my hobbies and interests but I'm not a fueled to them. At least when i do them yes I enjoy it but this anger comes back.

I'm so sick of it. Its tormenting. You think you make it into a peaceful happy life then either someone or life itself kicks you down as soon as you get better. I just don't want to be here anymore. Not even cause I hate myself. I actually want myself to be okay so just imagining ending it all being free from this painful headache. From all the sickening humans out there. That sounds lovely. Its sound like that would be the only thing I'd have to finally put my mind at rest. No more emotions that take over my life. It would be fine if I could be okay for a whole year without breaking down so bad like this. But i don't ever get that. Sense 13 my like has just felt like shit. I don't know how to feel anymore. Yeah maybe I can ride this out but ya know when you actively snap into a positive mindset finally and then anger comes along to kick it out. Well whats the point. All of that work is gone. Its obviously impacting my friendships and even work. I can't talk to people when the thought of blowing my head of is in my mind or when the crippling disgust of all the horrible things people have done to me is catching up. I'm just so annoyed now. I haven't hurt anyone but I've just stopped showing up. Only 2 fucking people would care about where I am and the other would be concerned about me.

Well I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't really have anyone to go to with this. Its funny I wanna give up on Humanity and stop relying on people but I'm here. I just want peace really. Also if anyone is concerned please don't have police show up again. That actually caused me to lose a lot of trust too. Maybe I'm just paranoid now cause how would they tap my stuff on here but whos knows. Just send the police to deal with the guy who needs comfort and care. I know it would be expecting a lot for some to read and respond sense nothing is ever really free but yeah. Well thanks if anyone does. I'm gonna lay down and hope I can swiftly fall asleep before it gets even worse.",1
"I've thought a lot about killing myself over the years, even tried a few times but nothing worked. I kind of accepted that God didn't want me to die. But I don't think I can keep going like this. I'm not enjoying my life. I just had my 30th birthday and it was extremely lonely. No big bash like I always see people have. Does not having a lot of friends mean I'm an awful person? I'm not able to do anything with my life but go to work and come home and watch tv and I hate that. I'm hate going to work because of my depression and I'm supposed to go on vacation but thanks to how poorly I'm paid I can't even go anywhere.

"My whole life I’ve constantly suffered, the past 3 days have been clearly the best in my whole life, 0 competition. I snuck out to meet up with my online friend for 3 nights and we messed around, I had my first kiss etc. I am so attached to him. the past few days I’ve felt truly relaxed, content, and happy, which I have never experienced before. The city I’m visiting is amazing, I had so much fun on this trip, had so many outstanding experiences and some world class ones. I loved my time here and I’m devastated that I have to return home. I’ve been utterly miserable for years and constantly suicidal. I saw the light for a brief amount of time and now I’m even more heartbroken. Most of all I don’t want to be separated from the guy I am so attached to. I’m kinda obsessed and think about him constantly. I won’t be able to see him for a year at least … and it’s extremely likely I will never see him again. I am grateful to have experienced this joy but I can’t function back at home, where I’m lonely and incredibly bored. Just absolutely devastated. I have to return home tomorrow and I will be back to my endless misery and suffering. Honestly kind of wish I hadn’t experienced this. Now I know how much I’m missing out. I saw for a minute the life I could lead, but it is extremely far away.. I just want to be with the guy I love. 😢 idek if he would be with me. ",1
"It's been 6 weeks since I lost all motivation to get out of bed, to go out, to go to work, and do other stuffs that I love before. I just realized that no matter how genuine and sincere you can be to others, there will still be unexpected people in your life that would only want to keep you just for their convenience and would only use you for their own selfish goals. After they got what they needed, you're just like some trash that didn't exist. This really hurts the most especially if the person you didn't expect was the one whom you poured your heart the most.

Not only was my heart and my trust broken but also my hope for love. It's always been this kind of situation since college, which was 9 years ago. But the pain that I'm feeling now is the worst pain I ever felt in my whole life. I can't sleep for more than 2 hours just because of having so many WHY'S in my head even though I take sleeping pills. Like I just want to swallow all of it in 1 take just to see if I can get the peaceful sleep I want and hope to never wake up again. Because I can't seem to understand why I always wind up in this situation. 

All I'm thinking is what's the loss of one genuine life if the world is full of shitty people.

It will happen so quickly that by the time anyone can do anything about it, I'll be long gone.

This is it. Now I'll be no more and don't have to live any longer. I never had a choice to be born so I'll make sure I have one now. 

There is no turning back and no last minute back outs. No more of that.

"This year has been the worst year for me. I had to leave the city that I loved, along with the community and friends I had, and move back home due to visa issues and my parents' health. I’m now faced with the possibility of changing careers (I worked in film) to support my wife and child, as it's not stable or lucrative here. This might mean abandoning my dream of becoming a film director due to external pressures( i come from a conservative community so film is looked down upon), and I’ve been feeling like a failure seeing all my old friends and relatives in higher positions while I struggle to stay financially afloat every day.

I thought this would be the year I finally made the film I worked so hard to write and assemble a team for (I've been pretending that I’m doing well and have just been focused on my film this year). However, it’s been impossible to juggle my dreams with having a family, addressing my parents' needs, finishing our house repairs, finding a potential job to make money, working on my film, and dealing with other personal emotional problems. 

This year, everything has fallen apart, and it has felt like a battle. Nothing has been simple, and I’m tired. I tried following my dreams, but I’m starting to doubt my abilities and whether I’ll ever reach where I want to be in life or be able to give my family the life they deserve. Maybe I’m too old to make it; maybe I missed my chance. 

I imagine life would be easier if my wife had married someone else and not me, a failed artist, or if I died so they could move on without needing to support me and my unrealistic dreams and expectations in life, maybe i’m just another failed dreamer that wasn’t tough enough to go all they way or able to sacrifice to make his dreams real because i’m weak... it doesn’t matter anymore i just want to kill all my ambitions, goals and dreams so i make life easier for myself and everyone around me.

"I have no skills. I didn’t go to school. I’ve been unemployed for two months and struggling to find a job because everything is so hard for me and I can’t do anything right. I’ve been living at my mom’s for over a year. I sleep on a mattress in a basement, I have nothing that belongs to me besides my cat and she’s the only reason I’m alive.
I have friends but no one I’m really that close with or feel comfortable enough to talk to.

All I want is for someone to love me. I was never protected, not even as a child and I hold so much resentment towards my mother for it. My dad’s dead. I have two older sisters but they don’t bother trying. I got dumped six months ago by the only person who noticed how broken I was and he made me feel so safe and cared for, but he is way too good for me and I don’t blame him for leaving.

I never complain. I’m nice to everyone, I don’t have a bad thing to say about anyone, and I do everything I can to support the people I care about but it’s never enough. 
I have no interests. I feel so dull and boring and I have nothing going on in my head. I have such a hard time finding things to talk about. 
I don’t think I’m a bad person but I don’t think I’m a good person either.
I spend all day alone and my mom doesn’t even check in on me. No one ever asks me how I am.

I started self harming again this year, the only person who’s seen my scars was a guy I was seeing  for a couple of months and I thought he cared.
I’ve starved myself to the point where I’m at least ten pounds underweight, I weigh as much as I did when I was 12 and no one notices, or if they do they just don’t care. 
I’m afraid of letting anyone else in because I’m so ashamed of myself and I can’t deal with being abandoned again but I want nothing more than to be close with someone. I will never be good enough.
I just want to be loved. I want someone to notice I’m not okay. I need someone to take care of me.

"I can’t take it anymore man the fact that I am so wildly different from everyone else around me in a way that only they can see has been weighing on me particularly hard recently, and it frustrates me to no end that I will never be able to fix it because I am autistic and I just have to accept that. It makes me feel so unlovable, I’m almost incapable of making friends, and my one close relationship is with my abusive boyfriend who I’m too scared to leave because he’s literally the only person who likes me- but even then he doesn’t respect me. I don’t understand why I can’t just be normal",1
"Basically as it suggests\~ I'm a 21 year old (F) who has struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a preteen. This is my first and I hope only boyfriend but I feel my own mental health struggles are causing a rift in our relationship. He has told me he resents me for the times i've gotten irrationally mad at him. I can see where he comes from and when i'm overstimulated or overwhelmed I don't handle it well, plain and simple I can be a bit of a b\*tch. On top of all this, my mood changes so rapidly he feels he has to walk on eggshells sometimes, I get in depressive moods which tell me that I don't deserve love and I don't deserve him. 

Further, I feel sometimes I wish i'd die or be murdered so he could let go of me (of a future with me) because all I want is for him to be happy. Although it would break me, its worth letting him go so he can be happier, more fulfilled, and appreciated in a relationship than he is now with me. I feel he deserves so much more than what I am giving him and I would die just to do that. I have told him on occasion these exact thoughts which has left him emotionally numb. I can tell that he has grown tired of this constant narrative of mine, he often tells me to ""just not"", and I sense I have caused him emotional trauma since he rarely and typically refuses to express his emotions with me anymore. 

I hold so much guilt for the pain I have caused him and I wish he would focus his attention towards someone more worthy of his unconditional love. 

I have gone to years of therapy on and off, I contextualize and intellectualize my emotions so much that I always feel multiple emotions at once in a given situation and fall into depressive patterns such as these whenever a stressor is present (intense uni schedule or narcissistic mom). All I want to do is not feel so many emotions anymore and sometimes I think its better for my boyfriend and myself if I died. 

My heart goes out to those who also feel this way. ",1

for the past 4 and half years I started noticing that something wrong so start seeking help, I found a therapist that got a discount for the first session, they told me that I got emotional numbness, I still don't know how to feel about it, ironically, I didn't continue with the therapy because I'm broke, I still keep it a secret from my family

"I often get made fun of for my poor English skills, which makes me really anxious about speaking. Just thinking about it gives me panic attacks. My classmates tease me about how I look, so I don’t really consider them friends. I’ve always dreamed of having a British accent, hoping it would help me fit in better. But most of the time, I feel lonely and isolated. At 19, I haven’t had the usual experiences like going to parties or having close friends. I worry about my future a lot and feel like I’ve failed, even though I used to dream of being an astronaut since I was four. Agoraphobia keeps me indoors; I’m too scared to go outside, even when my family goes on trips. I constantly think about my flaws and feel empty, much more than just typical teenage struggles.

Living in a developed country where everyone speaks English fluently makes me feel even more inadequate. I get jealous when I hear someone from another country speak with a perfect accent and flawless grammar, and it makes me feel like I’m not brave enough. Even my relatives, including my cousin, call me a coward because I’m afraid to speak English. Whenever I try to speak, it usually ends with people laughing or avoiding me. High school was tough; I was bullied a lot, called names like “monkey,” and people made hurtful jokes. My self-esteem is low, and I think I’m unattractive and unwanted. Whenever there are team activities, I’m always seen as weak or left out when others pick their teams. My parents favor my lighter-skinned brother, which makes me feel unloved and constantly compared unfairly.

In my native country, it was no better. My kindergarten teacher used to make fun of me and physically abuse me so severely that it lasted for years until I moved to the UK at 14. The teachers there shamed and physically abused me for minor reasons, but where I lived, this treatment was normal. My parents were also harsh; they would beat me severely for even the smallest mistakes, never giving me a chance to learn. My so-called friends used to mock my appearance, calling me ugly and making me feel worthless. Now, at my age, people make fun of me because I’m still a virgin. It’s led me to smoke and drink beer, neglecting my self-care and feeling like I don’t matter anymore.

I have always been labeled as weak and a failure, especially by my dad who constantly tells me I will never succeed. He looks at me with disappointment, seeing only failure. I’ve never achieved anything worthwhile; I feel like a coward and stupid too. Exams and assessments were always my worst nightmare; I consistently received the lowest marks. In group discussions, no one liked me because of my language barrier; they often ignored me or skipped over me altogether. I’m scared to become an adult because I feel too weak, and I worry that I’ll end up alone. These thoughts weigh heavily on me, making me doubt my ability to handle adulthood.Oh and btw lm black

And when I went to my friend's last time in the West, I almost caved in and sniffed cocaine. If it weren't for my female friend telling me ' don't "" I'd have sniffed it.

Instead, I swallowed 900 mg of quetapine (I'm meant to take 600) and had a dozen glasses of alcohol (ouzo, beer, wine...)

"i wanna preface this by saying i am in no way saying that people don’t deserve to live, not at all, and i don’t want anyone to misinterpret my words as that. i’m just thinking i don’t understand how normal people have the inherent feeling that they deserve to be alive, because i don’t. like even when they fuck up, they never feel the urge to hurt themselves or kill themselves. i just don’t understand. how do people constantly have the innate feeling that they deserve to be alive? i just don’t get it.

"I simply cannot find a way to (financially) get out of this monthly loop of just having enough to pay rent, taxes etc. In fact I would love to no longer work for someone who doesn't even know who I am ever again. I don't mind working though, I would in fact love to ""work"" physically, hiking up the Alps, biking across an entire country, kayaking through beautiful rivers. I would love work with my hands in my own garden, secluded by the pollutions of modern cities and put in hard work on fixing or adjusting whatever may be needed on my very own house, in a beautiful countryside. All these things however - travelling, fully owning a house in a beautiful area - cost a lot of money. With my lack of talents and understanding of moneymaking I simply cannot see a way to achieve financial independence to experience (live) these things and as such I cannot ever see myself living the (rather simple) life I would love to live, with its occasional travels and the cozy house surrounded by nature. To me, I just see no point in living when I can't even find the path towards that goal. I can't get out of the system so to speak.

"Broke up with my girlfriend of seven years about about 4 months ago. Seven was our special numbers so I was going to propose July. I feel as if I did it because I was depressed and I lost myself and I lost trust because I caught her lying so many times about silly things. Started to feel I lost us and we were arguing a lot and one day I just snapped. I have been regretting it.

Then lost my job, which I had a really great opportunity at, and it was purely due. The reason I was depressed from the break up, and I couldn’t get myself out of bed for a couple weeks. I feel like I’ve just been drinking and being sad and I’ve tried to eat healthy and go outside and be with people and I just felt depressed and sick like I’m not myself anymore.

I’ve always had depression, yet I’ve always dealt with it very well. I moved out of the house early on Was fairly successful. I don’t get the chance to visit my parents very much. I always knew my mom is a wine drinker but these past four years. I’ve slowly seen her basically kill herself with alcohol. This last year was just got really bad and I feel like I’ve already lost her. 

I’m a big mama boy I can’t even have a normal conversation with her anymore, she can’t walk, and she is starting get dementia from drinking so much. This Mother’s Day she called me by the wrong name and was totally out of it. Life has just been moving so fast. I feel like I didn’t even notice it and she was the best supportive mom growing up so I just don’t understand what happened. Recently, she asked me to go get a gun and kill her, and I didn’t I didn’t even know what to say and just left it just broke me. In and out of rehab have costed me and my dad so much and she just doesn’t wanna get better. I feel as if I’m gonna lose her any day now.

And then I had two friends commit suicide one last month, one this month and I had no idea if their struggles. The first you know was rough cause he had four kids so I just basically tried my hardest to help take care of everything for them, but it was a rough process. Then just last week my buddy shot himself and left a note which I was mentioned in. His mother asked me to write a eulogy for his funeral. This is his one of my close friends who I would come to you when I was down, and he was the best at working me through it. I couldn’t find the words, but I eventually did and I wrote it and then when it was time to go up and read it, I couldn’t even speak a word and had to have someone read it for me.

I have a lot of close friends that love me and then I can talk to, but for some reason, I am so embarrassed and have a hard time opening up other people I don’t want to see the weakness. I’ve always been really confident and I’ve just lost myself and I don’t really know who the fuck I am anymore. I’m only 25 years old and I feel like I dealt with my depression great with hobbies and staying busy. But this year has just crushed me and I don’t even know what to say or what to do. I started a new business which is going well and I have a second job so I’m helping out with a lot of family financial problems. Yet I hate myself and I hate my life, I feel I lost myself along time ago and now I just covered up with drugs.

It feels like rockbottom and that’s not even all of it. I’m trying to keep it short. I don’t know why I’ve came to myself so much and I’ve tried therapy, but I just filled so disconnected. I miss my ex-girlfriend and she needs time alone and I feel stupid for letting her go. I’m looking for support and advice because I feel broken and wanna get better but I still just sit here and weep every day.

"so i don't really think i'm depressed. it's just like sadness bruh. 

i understand that this isn't like doctors diagnosis or anything, this is reddit for goodness sakes. i just wanna hear like public opinion 

so couple things:
a. i lost passion in things i used to love (reason being i'm not good enough)
b. too lazy/no motivation or drive to even try to get good at the things i say i'm not good enough at

1. i hate my friends all of a sudden. (Not all of a sudden it's been a gradual climb. it's just like all their little quirks just set me off. i can't handle their entire personality) 
i have been friends with them for a while so maybe i just grew out of them? 
2. i kinda am disliking my family. not my family, just my siblings. (i'm the youngest and all my siblings are highly accomplished so i have a big gap to fill in. i feel like i have no personality and only my older siblings exist. i just hate how i'm constantly compared to my siblings and have nothing that they can compare to. I DONT HATE MY SIBLINGS. i hate that i get compared to them)
maybe all normal siblings hate each other? also maybe it's an inferiority complex thing idk. 
3. i really just hate myself for being all these things. (I feel like i have no true reason to hate any of my friends or siblings. they all are great people but for some reason i can't handle them. I just don't understand why i hate them so violently. it just makes me feel like a disgusting shitty horrible person.)
is this depression or just like me being an unreasonably bad dude?

I just wanna start on saying im serious on this post, I am actually seeking for help, like therapy tho i dont want to you know? but please give me advice. 

Hi, im Z, i have the thoughts and actions of Inc*st, sorry for the word, but yeah. It all started when I hit puberty, I had this older brother who i put my H*rniness into. I know its so wrong but its so hard to fight the urge. Until now I still do, But just last month, I had just realize its immoral, and such a big sin so i stopped (voyeur), after that, I still had the guts to do actions of Inc*st, I actually had been caught by my older brother, after that we act like nothing happened, we talk the same, we sometimes laugh together, so all goods on that i guess! As of right now, my addiction has been died down (I hope) I just really wanna move on pass by this, I need help. I need advice. Its so immoral i wanna move on. 

I read one Quora answer that its probably just because im young and bc of my hormones, and thats why I put my Older brother in that position, which I guess was true. I had a Mutual Understanding relationship once and I didnt bother to put attention to my Older brother, so i guess its true you know?

I hope you guys wont be harsh on me, Because i am seeking for help and advice on how to move on! I wanna be the best version of myself, to make the LUST go away, I get panic attacks and overall anxiety about it. Need help.",1

"Hi all,
this is gonna be a long post so many thanks in advance for your precious help.
I’m struggling to cope with my boyfriend’s depression as I don’t really know what’s going on in his head, therefore I don’t know what’s the best thing to do to help him and us as a couple.
So - to give you a bit of background: we’ve been together since last November; when we met and started dating we realised we weren’t just physically attracted to each other - we had lots of things in common and saw life the same way. When ok, he really is an amazing partner, very caring and supportive. I felt (and still feel) very lucky to have him. He disclosed his depression struggles to me from the beginning; he suffered from it all his life (he’s 28 now) and that is due to his bad upbringing/bad life experiences, + a feeling of being powerless to change things which are wrong in society.
When I got to know him better, I started to see his depression episodes unfolding and I also learned to see when they start as he becomes very apathetic and tells me he feels “cold and empty”. I’ve been observing the pattern and the length of these episodes varies: they may go from a few days to more serious ones which last a few weeks. During these episodes he bottles up, doesn’t go to work and neglects himself - he just lays in bed with no strength for anything; needless to say, during these times he disappears from me too and sometimes without warning (we don’t live together). When he’s ok and back to normal, he always tells me not to worry as he adores me so I should never take his illness personally - he just needs a break from everything as he can’t deal with anything. He doesn’t want to take medications and never did; I fully support this decision as I 100% agree. He simply wants to find the core reason of the problem and deal with it himself. He recently started to see a psychologist once or twice a week, but I can’t really see any improvement: some days he feels very happy and hopeful but some others (the majority of them) he’s back to his struggles. Now I know that depression is a serious disease and it may take him years to get over it, but my questions are: will he ever be able to fully recover from it, or he will have to embrace the illness all his life? Is it possible for me to get used to it and for us to have a fulfilling relationship despite this?
I’m asking you because he doesn’t want to talk too much about it with me.
Also, I tend to worry a lot when he disappears without warning, as I can’t help but questioning his feelings for me or - even worse - I start getting paranoid that he may kill himself. He told me more than once that he never feels suicidal, just apathetic so not to worry. However, I can’t help but texting him and telling him I miss him and I hope he’s ok, but I don’t usually get a reply during these episodes so I really feel left out.
As a partner, what’s the best thing to do/way to deal with him disappearing? Should I not contact him at all knowing that he will come back to me when the episode subsides?
I look forward to getting some insight from other people who struggle (or did struggle) with depression. Thank you so much!!",0
"Basically what the title says. I live in the UK and have a partner whom I’m getting the mortgage with. He knows about my struggles and also knows that I’m doing a bit better now. However, I’m not sure how long it’ll last. I don’t want him to have to pay it off on his own. 

Another option I’m considering is getting a life insurance so that he’s covered in case I die but not too sure how much of a safety net that is.

Does anyone struggling have a mortgage? What are your thoughts?",1
"I don't know how to really start this. It's hard for me to ask for help as a adult man. But I'm in need of help immediately. I have put this off for far to long after being told by a friend I should ask for help here. Let's start with why I need help. This is a lot so bare with me please. I feel I need to tell the whole story so everyone that is going to help knows exactly what happened even if it means putting all my personal information out there. The main thing I am worried about is my oldest son. He has been struggling with adhd and depression since he started school. He is on medication and sees doctors twice a month for it. To say the least I'm his strong backbone that helps him when he has his bad days. I was forced to leave him and ever since he had really been struggling. I'm asking for help to fix my car (650) and get gas money (350)to get back to be in the same state with him and as well as my other kids but he needs me the most especially now. He is turning 10 on July 18th. I want to be back there for him and with him as soon as possible. I can't describe how much stress this has caused me mentally and physically. I been working at a dead end job to just try and stay afloat and get my car fixed which just stopped working so I can get back to him. I'm really ashamed to ask for help as a grown man. But it isn't about me anymore. I need to get back to him and I can't do it on my own.I NEED HELP. PLEASE.


Here is a back story to what happened to get me in this situation. At the end of last year 2023 around November I lose my home that I worked to keep for two years. ( A lil back story. I'm not trying to bash anyone or place all blame on anyone because I'm at somewhat fault as well for not seeing the signs. I was blinded by what I thought was love. It all started on Christmas Eve 2021 when my life began to change. My and my girlfriend of a year at the time were in a a really bad car accident. She was injured pretty bad. So I took on the mantle of providing for our family. This turned out to be a crucial decision. I spent the next two years busting my tail to provide for her and her daughter as well as my own three kids I have. It was working out pretty good for a year or more or so. I was able to maintain our home and both our cars. It started to get overwhelming after such a lengthy period of time. In this time I exhausted all my avenues of trying to stay afloat and allowing her to heal properly by staying at home and me taking all responsibilities for everything. I maxed out all my credit cards and was working two jobs day and night to try to be the man and keep everything that I had gotten for us. I finally after so long pressured her to start looking for a job I could no longer do it alone. Which gets to where the main problems started to happen. I didn't realize how much pressure I was putting on her because I was stressed out and maxed out. Well this pressure actually made things worst because now things she didn't say before came to light. Which was she was depressed on how the car accident made her look and feel and she shut down. So for the next half of year or so when I begged for help and pleaded I couldn't do it anymore. Things took a turn for the worst. Instead of helping me she shut down. Then month by month we ended up getting lights turned off. Next month water turned off. It was just a domino affect. One thing lead to another. Robbing Peter to pay Paul as they say. Finally it came to a head and we were kicked out of our home because turns out she was not paying the bills like I thought she was. Which is why I take blame I put all that on her to pay the bills (as in call in and make sure they were paid since I was working to make the money for them. All while she was not doing that. She was depressed coming to find out because of how she felt after the accident. So instead of paying the bills she used lots of the money for self care which turned out to be cheating as well. So we are kicked out and all of our things put on the curb. I was then forced to move states away from my kids with family because I had no where else to go. I'm am cracking under the pressure mentally and physically to be quite honest. Seeing my son struggle ever since I had to leave is heart breaking. I'm only asking for help to fix my car and gas to get back there. I already have a friend that is going to allow me to stay with them until I get back on my feet so I can be closer to my kids. I have secured a job for when I get back there so I'm not asking for handouts and not doing anything positive to help myself. I just need a little help to get ahead.


Anthing would help whether it's a dollar or two or if your feeling more generous. I just want to get back to my son where I belong and where he needs me. I thank everyone in advance for taking the time to read my story and possibly helping. Thank you may God bless us all.

I'm a shitty son. Probably because I'm a shitty student and a shitty boyfriend. And I'm a shitty student because I'm fucking stupid or lazy, and I'm thinking it might be both. And in turn that makes me shitty at my job, which I already don't make that much money in.

I'm a shitty boyfriend because I push her boundaries. Especially during sex. I'm a monster to her. And I don't know why. She's the best thing in my life. She's my shining star. And I hurt her. Again and again and again. She says that I don't respect or love her. That she's just someone to fuck to me. I hate myself. Why did I become this person. Why am I hurting the person that I means so much to me and makes me to happy.

I want it all gone. Everyone would be happier if I disappeared right? My father wouldn't have to pay for me to go through school anymore. My girlfriend is so charming and smart and kind that she'd find someone better woth no problem. 

I know I shouldn't think that I should die. Maybe it's me being cowardly and trying to avoid facing the consequences of my actions. I just don't want her to leave. And I know it's not fair to cling onto her. Or to ask her for forgiveness. I ruined it. I ruined us. And now I'm going to be alone again. And it's my fault. I think it about it more and more lately.

"Bonjour a tous

Besoin de parler du vécu qui est actuellement en train d'arriver et n'arrive plus à surmonter

Pour résumer ma situation j'ai 36 ans une compagne de 36 ans également avec qui nous sommes fusionnel, une entreprise de 7 salariés avec un salaire confortable, une vie simple d'entrepreneur qui roulait parfaitement 

Mais il y a 2 mois tout c'est écroulé subitement, mon activité c'est brutalement stoppé, l'administration m'ayant retiré les autorisations me permettant de travailler... et tout cela à cause notamment de MES propres erreurs et prise de décisions catastrophique 

Ne pouvant quasi plus travailler j'ai malheureusement dû licencier le personnel et doit faire face à de multiples problèmes : procédure judiciaire en cours, forte amende (en centaine voir millions d'euros), licenciement des salariés, prison mais vraisemblablement sursis, contrôle fiscal j'ai fais que de la merde avec ma société, impossibilité de payer les charges à venir, liquidation judiciaire, faillite personnel... Bref une erreurs que que je risque de payer toute mon existence

Depuis ma vie est devenu un véritable enfer, je vis dans le stress permanent; je ne dors plus que sous Stilnox et sous Lexomil, je n'ai plus le goût à rien, je suis en dépression sévère et n'ai que des idées noirs...

Je passe mon temps à ruminer, me dire que j'aurais dû faire ci faire ça, comment j'en suis arrivé là, j'en veux à tout le monde alors que le seul fautif est MOI MEME

J'ai perdu toute la confiance et complicité que j'avais avec ma compagne (l'une des rares chose qui me rendait heureux), nous allons perdre notre maison notre sécurité financière et surtout notre amour qui ne survivra certainement pas à cette épreuve

Je suis en train de sombrer et ai bien peur de ne pas pouvoir assumer toutes les problèmes qui risquent d'arriver. 

Pour les personnes ayant subi ce genre d'épreuve comment avez vous fait pour affronter ce type d'événement? Comment y faire face? ",0
"Title says it all. I’m sick of feeling the way I do, and I don’t have access to anything that will fix it, except death and medication. Since dying is a last resort, is there any medicine out there that will numb or completely eliminate my brain’s emotional response receptors?",0
"Almost 30 now and have been in the same spot in life for 10+ years now. Smoking my life away watching everything pass me by. This year I decided to try to get trauma therapy to address when I was sexually abused when I was little.. Needless to say it’s fucked my whole head up. Not only am I having the flashback dreams I been having for years, I am day-nightmaring vividly about the day I was raped. I have been out of work while I get this therapy and had to dip into Roth IRA to pay rent and bills &amp; this past time I ended up paying off this months rent and gambling the rest of the money away. — that’s another thing that hasn’t made anything easier. I like to make things more difficult for myself. I feel like I’m acting more irrational than ever before and don’t see value in staying alive to watch myself flounder

"I only just turned 17 last month, but i don't want to live, not that i'm sad , i'm too lazy for anything i don't want to experience the hardships of university even if i have to, i don't to work even if i want to 
I would like to just laze around doing nothing 
I'm a lazy piece of shit
I know i won't kill myself because of religion and stuff, sometimes i strangle myself but stops because i can't breathe logic lol
Don't wanna die to suffer even more in hell lol
I feel like if i could die rn at this moment i wouldn't regret it, like why experience hardships and maybe sin if i can just go to heaven rn 
I'm not bullied or anything, not that they could, im pretty fighting spirited but since school ended all i do is watch my phone or pc all day till 5 am and repeat every day
Not motivated for everything 
Not looking forward to anything ",1
"ive never really used reddit so yh dont judge me  
Hi, I'm a 13 year old girl, I live with my mom and my dad left me when I was 6, honestly I couldn't care less for him. I can hardly remember him. I have 7 sisters, (4 older, 3 younger) and 3 older brothers. My house is pretty fucked up to be honest. I got my phone smashed because I didn't make my younger sister food even though my mom told her to make it. My mom hasn't bought me a new phone yet, (its been 6 months). My mom also has walked in on me when I'm showering, I know she's my mom and all, but it just makes me uncomfortable to be honest. I remember one time in year/grade 6 (when I was about 11/10 years old), I felt really shitty and I just wanted to end myself, all my friends left me and made rumours about me and I remember I told one of my sisters about it, she told me I was overreacting. Then I hid the note behind the couch I completely forgot about it. My mom found it a few days later, she began screaming at me, she was pissed. I just cried in my room. I've never felt so shitty. I've been losing my friends, being disruptive and getting high. I've had thoughts about killing my mom and family members whenever I felt shitty. I've had thoughts of stabbing myself over and over again. I just want to end it all. I've been self-harm free for 2 months. I really want to finish myself off, I just want to actually fucking die. Please don't say that I have potential or that I shouldn't, I just want to die. I really want to die, I've tried overdosing, hanging etc. I want to be sent away to a mental hospital, please.

"I planned to do it today. I had everything set up but mum found my pills. My fiancé left me and I really don’t know how to cope with it. I have bpd and I know I get attached to people it’s part of my disorder. But I really didn’t think I’d ever have to be without him. We were planning our wedding, started to buy our first house planning to have kids. And now I have nothing. I don’t have many friends around me. Only a couple from work who I don’t really see outside of work. I did everything with him. I enjoyed doing nothing because he’d always be with me. 
I’m thinking of hanging myself but I don’t know a lot about how to get it done. I know where I’d do it, there’s a forest near me I always used to walk my old dog. I need to get a rope and maybe a step stool otherwise I don’t know how to get up to a branch. I’m thinking of doing it Friday night. ",1
"I feel like this is probably just as much a release and hopefully helps me let out a lot of tension I have inside me. 

I have a history of suicide, I tried when I was 14 and failed (which is quite ironic because I was doing it because I felt like a failure). I’m 26 now and the feelings have got stronger and stronger day by day. 

It’s hard to explain because on paper I’m very fortunate. I’ve got a good job, I’ve got mostly a good lifestyle and I live one of the best cities in the world. Butttt.. I hate myself, I hate everything about myself outside of the situation I’m in. 

I hate my skin colour, it makes me feel like an outsider in my own country, with my own friends. I’ve been brought up in a society that I believe thinks being white is better and that’s more so drilled into me and my thinking. So many people saying oh you aren’t British, no no where are you really from. 

My dad left my family when I was young. Which I think is pretty common but it’s the lack of effort he tried with me. His only communications with me, if we can even classify it as that, was to goad my mother. 

My last girlfriend told me she doesn’t love me and felt like she never could. That shit cut me so deep, I felt unlovable and even when asking to explain it she said she didn’t know, but I was so nice she wanted to try.

My mum has always put the pressure on me to perform and whilst that has meant I’ve achieved a lot of academic success. I will always look for the negative in myself or the situation because that’s how it’s always been for me. My mum would always point out my weak points to prove. 

I can pinpoint all the things that I don’t like about myself and where they stem from, and yes I’ve tried therapy, I’ve tried medication too. They just don’t seem to subdue or get better. ",1
"I’m a 31 year old woman and I honestly fantasize about just passing away in my sleep all the time. I have no relationship with any of my family except a mom who only talks about the newest diet she is on and only wants me to be okay so she doesn’t have to deal with my sadness , and my friends don’t even ever want to hang out with me because they are all codependent on their partners. I literally enjoy nothing and right when I wake up and open my eyes I feel flooded with anxiety, and then when I open my phone all I see are ads about how to get rid of cortisol face or whatever stupid diet trend is out now . I have no money despite working harder than my parents ever did. I don’t enjoy any hobbies or music or shows and even my vices like alcohol and weed don’t do anything anymore. I exercise but it doesn’t help. All I think about all day is how much I don’t want to be in my own body.",0
"i have no idea if this even makes sense but it feels like my brain is tired. Physically, I could sleep 24/7 if i let myself, but beyond that my brain just doesn't want to think about anything anymore. I just sit around head empty. I have plenty ideas of things I like to do/want to do in theory, but i cant bring myself to because the mental energy required is off the charts. I gave up my phone a few days ago so i no longer doom scroll, instead i have replaced it with just laying in bed doing nothing. Im starting outpatient treatment and left my job which means i cut ties with my inconsiderate boss, but instead of feeling better now im just scared because im directionless once again. im on prozac and klonopin, i have no idea if theyre even working. I have my first day of outpatient on Monday. Hoping to god this fixes what evers gone wrong in my brain",0
"(M) (22)
Where do I begin, I spent all of my childhood dealing with trauma (now live with my dad who saved me from the abuse), have 2 failed relationships, dropped out of 2 colleges because I'm autistic and struggle with everything, being so hideous I cry alot wishing I was better looking, I eat unhealthy, lost 4 people last year 2 family members to cancer and 2 to suicide and only found out a few weeks ago 2 more of my family members have cancer, I have a diploma in computing but due to trauma I've been left with extremely shaky hands making working on computing impossible it makes me feel like a fraud. I already have attempted once with an overdose but everyday I struggle to do anything I feel like a failure to my family I almost feel like a leech knowing I'll never be able to give back everything they've given me 

Here in the UK due to a lack of funding I'm not able to get any real treatment, the last suicide hotline I vented to said to me ""what do you want me to do about it"" and when I almost made another attempt I was told ""unless you're actively bleeding, stop calling us"" or ""drink camomile tea and go for a walk"" 

Truthfully I hadn't planned on living this long and just nothing feels like it's gonna change I can't be happy about anything as once I do something always goes wrong like I mentioned with my other family with cancer

I truthfully just don't know where to turn from here just when I think I've hit rock bottom it goes even further.",1
"So I have been deeply depressed for the past five years. My mom finally told me she had cancer, covid prohibited me from coming home in her last years and she passed. Then a few months ago my soul dog had to be put down after months of seizures. I do have a history of depression I will say. Well, I have since come home. Went to the doctor who said I have depression. Colour me surprised. I was put on medication. My dad doesn't believe in therapy and since I spent my life savings on my dog's treatment and have yet to get my documentation in order for a new job in my profession I do not have money to get a therapist. I was asked by both remaining members of my core family the above. They also added the fact that they miss the old me. So far I have chosen to respond to the one using film and tv quotes since he doesn't want to hear anything negative. To my dad who I live with I respond when spoken to. To his girlfriend I am polite especially when she keeps saying men are like this. The family dog is a good listener though. She has yet to offer advice. I just needed to vent. Thank you. ",0

"Hi there, I am not a native speaker so, yes, I really want to write down my story.

I am 26 and last year i divorced my marriage, we where together since I am 17.. so you see a long time. Nothing bad happend, we didn't cheat or something else. I'll guess it's my fault wasting his time. 

I grew up in a village from a good parent household. My parents know his parents and they always said, ohhh our children should be a couple, dream couple ... and and and... for some real we got pushed in this role, but I don't want to play a victim, it was my own decision (I guess) 

I was never really happy in this relationship, he knows, my parents knows, we had nothing similar. I am more that type of human ""spread love and help everyone"" and he was more like ""other humans problems are not my business"" (he's banker, you're problem is only his business when you need money) &lt; his favorite joke 

Ok - so in this RS, Marriage from 2014 to 2023 we seen a lot, we buyed a lot, 2 houses, moved 900 KM away from our home and much more. 

It's like I was sleeping and last year I woke up from a dream and don't want to life this live anymore, it's like a bubble popped and I tried so hard to suppress this unhappiness but... i couldn't. I divorced and he was ok. We don't have a fight or trouble, we are friends now. We don't had children together, just cat &amp; dog. (Our future goal was always, be richer then to others 😓)

Since then I am single and I don't sleep with someone else, because I feel like wtf how should this work with someone else? And I am a wife or I was a wife, I am too good for this hook up culture! 

.... Now I am here, feel completely lost, I don't want my old life back, but I feel like, I can't see the why for living. Why I am here, what todo. Anxiety haunt me everyday. 

From the outside I am strong / independent women. But in the inside I am a children. 

And I don't do drugs, no medicine, alcohol, no smoking... I eat healthy and still feel so depressed. 😔 

I feel like I don't know who I am.. where I am be and and and. All my friends have BC 30+
Wtf I was all this time married and had no time for this, when they where drunk at party's I was at work, nursed my dad and cooked for my husband! (No we are not a religious cult or something like this, we are not religious) 

I really feel lost, I feel like shit but my old life was not good at all too. My old life was a golden cage.

I don't know, I really feel like everyone around me is in a dream bubble and I am the only one who is awake 🥲

And I feel so much guilt and shame, how much time I waste in his life. I mean yes I was always honestly about my unhappiness, but I was never brave enough to go. 

I literally destroyed 2 lives, mine and his. I wish I could suppress my emotions and feelings and life with him until we are old. But over the years it got everything so worse, that I didn't wanted that he touch me anymore. But I was always loyal! I never cheated. 

Omg my head feel so sick 🤢

"i’m such a kind and soft and gentle person. people come up to me and call me an angel and tell me i’m a nice calming presence. 

and then my brain sees that same kind, gentle thing and is reminded of its birth-given curse to destroy anything that can’t defend itself. i know how to be kind because i know how to be cruel. i know the pain of all the terrible mean things i could say to anyone else, because i’ve inflicted every single ounce of that pain on myself. 

it’s like when a cat sees a fish in a bowl. a boy sees an ant. a hawk sees a kitten. there’s that need to torture and kill something so defenseless. it’s a part of the circle of life. sadly, for me, it’s the curse of being the predator and the prey. i’m too kind to hurt anything else, but something needs to hurt. i have to be the destroyer and the destroyed. 

im not exactly religious, but i think that there is some sort of cosmic reason for everything. i think i was put on this earth and met the people i’ve met for a reason. i want to have a positive impact on everyone around me. sadly my sacrifice is my own vessel. even though i don’t think i was meant to be here for very long, i want to leave this world a better place than i found it.

"God I dont even know where to start with this, I only stopped crying 5 minutes ago. I had relapsed tonight on multiple counts, I relapsed with SH and Alcohol. I had some friends help me through it but once I left call I went back to feeling terrible. For context im 18 and have attempted too many times to count and have been hospitalized 5 times from past attempts. because of it my family is in a lot of medical debt. All my attempts in the past have been very little planning, little researching, at most I planned for 2 months and then I didnt research and didnt take a lethal dose of pills. But this time ive done more research, I know what method in specific Id like to use and that it would be a high success rate. tonight I started writing suicide notes to all my friends and while writing one of my friends who helped me earlier messaged me. they had said around a week ago their experience with one of their friends committing and It didnt really set in till I was writing how much it would hurt them. I broke down for a while, I hadnt cried that hard in god knows how long. I feel awful, I want to die so bad but I know Id hurt them and all my other friends so much. I feel like such a piece of shit for even thinking about it and I dont know what to do. obviously all of you on here will tell me not to do it, but I dont think I could even though I want to.

"Is there actually recovering? I don't know, I keep cycling through different lows or layers of my own issues. Sometimes I'll think maybe it's better now but then I just fall into something else, and come out worse.

I'm genuinely concerned if my brain was just rewired wrong so early to a point that I can't fix it. If anybody has dealt with all of it as a kid, can it actually get better? Can someone talk about it?

I did therapy as a child, teen and now at 18 I'm in a recovery program. I won't go into a whole ramble but im always depressed, I just cycle through additional issues. Self harm, eating disorders, attempts etc. 

I thought I was doing better, I recovered from anorexia last year and it's almost a year since my last attempt. In actuality I've just begun abusing alcohol when self isolating, it's a Tuesday and I'm hungover and throwing up.

"Sorry for the stupid title, i lack originality and will to think about it.

I'm male, 21 years old and living in Italy. I've felt depressed in the last years, but i think that it's only in the last two that i've got clinical depression. Sadly i don't have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist, it's just that my sadness is worst and i see nearly every symptom in me. 
I've always thought about the possibility of suicide, but never in a totally serious way until these last months. Now i'm searching ways to do it, thinking what and if leave something to the few people i care etc.

To be honest i don't know why i'm writing this. I was searching ways to kill myself and found this subreddit, then thought ""Why not?"". Now i feel even more pathetic to be honest, i've read a lot of stories here, people in huge pain and with big problems while i'm depressed just because of problems with myself and my family. It feels like i don't deserve to complain about it and that i'm just stupid to be sad.

Two days ago i was hanging me, but choose not to because i cannot leave my girlfriend alone. She's also depressed (actually diagnosed) and doesn't deserve more suffering, i'm trying to live in orser to make her less sad, but i don't know how long i'll be able to.
She wants me to go to therapy, but i don't think my parents can afford it and probably would think that i'm stupid, crazy or not really depressed if i'd tell them this. I don't work so i don't earn a thing, but i'm thinking that i could maybe work some months before/during uni lessons just to afford some therapy sessions... I don't know.

"I was diagnosed by my therapist and psychiatrist with depression and was prescribed Wellbutrin. A lot of my symptoms involve lack of motivation, overwhelming feelings of being uninspired, having a fatalistic attitude towards my day (like no matter what I do, I'm convinced of a negative outcome for a lot of things,) sometimes having random spells of being emotional, and feeling too overwhelmed to engage in my tasks for the day so much that I just end up sleeping a lot. When I do push/fight through to get something done, it feels very exhausting and often don't feel accomplished even if the outcome was great on paper.

My psychiatrist mentioned that this is not a stimulant, which I am trying to avoid, but that this would help with those symptoms, especially with getting my motivation regulated. 

Id like to ask if anyone in this sub has had any success or failures with this medication. How has your experience been? Did you have similar symptoms that improved after taking this medication? Also, I'd appreciate any tips you might have for when you're on the medication (i.e. drinking more water than usual, adding/avoiding certain foods, etc.)

Depression  
Not good enough at academics

I can continue my healing from depression and I might overcome it, I can just study more slowly and maybe hire a tutor. 

Additionally, having experienced heartbreak numerous times before, I have grown familiar with it and can now move on more easily.

But at the end, I forget my dad is a person too. I always reply to him monotonously as if he is not my dad, speaking in a way like I want him gone and just not bother me anyone. I only say thank you when I got what I wanted, I rarely say love you to him. I tried spending time with him because you never know when he's gone but I never did. 

Few hours ago, my dad unlocked my door with a key and asked me if I ate already, I said I already did and to not use the key anymore and just at least knock in a disrespectful tone. I wish I could have said that differently to be honest. He lashed out and said he noticed how disrespectful I have been lately and that he gave everything to me even though he has been struggling at work as a single parent. I couldn't say anything but stare at him from my bed. After that he just slammed my door and left me feeling extremely guilty to the point I intent to k*ll myself that moment, I have constant thoughts of relieving the burden of being a spoiled brat. I grabbed my belt from my closet and tied it to a somewhat n*ose to hang it on a door and hang myself with. I thought of all the things that could happen if I ended it here right now. It could take a while for everyone to grieve, but the burden of having to put up to my shit is not there anymore. It felt like a win for everyone. But the thought of the pain made me hesitate, so I just went to self harm, sliding a small but sharp thread cutter along my arms. It felt liberating, to physically punish myself because no one will. 

Lately I've been struggling mentally, I starved myself as a form of punishment, even self harm. I wanted to run away from everyone, start a new life, a chance to change my disgusting behavior. But I'm still an upcoming college student, (19) no job, barely any savings. Why is it hard for me to accept that I'm extremely fucking lucky to have this life? Why do I have to bring others down? When I see my friends bond with their family, I always get so jealous even though I'm the problem. I really love my dad, but I can't seem to show it or act it.

I don't blame anyone but myself, so why is it hard for me to change my shitty self?

"This is kinda a vent post but I do want support to help.
I'm currently at the hospital with a sister in law having a baby. Her whole family is her and their friends. My husband's family is very conservative and they always jab at us for being alternative / emo etc. (Also I'm sad I can't have a child right due to finances  now had a miscarriageast year around this time) so I'm on edge I guess. Trying to not cry. But I'm sitting here in the waiting room and I say to my husband's mom, ""I hope they let us babysit when she is more grown I'd love to."" They look at me like wtf no. I instantly try not to cry...

Then I'm talking about how if I have a kid I'd try to get on all fours because that's better and easier for the women, it's a more natural position than laying on your back.

A family friends goes, ""omg if you have a child it be like the exorcist""

Like wtf does that mean?
That I'd scream and cry cause yes I would obviously anyone should.
Or that I'd have a demon baby cause they are mad I'm not Christian conservative. 

Either way I'm triggered in many ways and I'm trying to stay cool, meanwhile my husband is sitting there unaware to any of the slights against us. ",0
"Warning: Language (IDK if this is worthy of a warning or not), small mention of sex

(Note: I never meant to be a jerk to anyone. A lot of people don't see me as a jerk, and I've tried to change my actions to be kinder and better. I never tried to do any of this to impress anyone. I did it because I was naive and being a dumbass)

I'm sorry for venting I just have nobody to vent to. I've just been holding this in too long.

I've made some really dick moves and I feel like a terrible person. I've hurt people I didn't mean to hurt (I never meant to hurt anyone emotionally or physically, but I guess I didn't realize I hurt them emotionally), and I feel terrible thinking that I might have caused them to do something to themselves they might deeply regret, and I might've started some downward spiral and I feel super guilty.

When I was in 7th grade (a few years ago), I didn't know I was aroace (aromantic and asexual, lacking romantic or sexual attraction) so I felt confused and hormones were weird and shit so I got obsessed with other people's relationships because I was basically suppressing the fact that I hadn't really ever liked anyone. There was this one girl my friend and I talked to like every day in PE and I didn't think I was being a dick. Looking back, I know I was. I'm 80% sure she liked me but I didn't understand people actually lied about not liking someone. She said she hated me and I quite literally told her how much I didn't like her. She was probably lying. I was not. I was being a fucking piece of shit to her and I didn't realize it. She thought I liked her, and she thought I was lying about what I was saying.

There was another incident where she thought I liked her but it was because there was multiple threats written in the bathroom at our school and my friend and I were almost certain her and her bf did it (note: we had nothing against them. She was sweet and kind and thhe bf was a chill guy. We just had pretty good evidence and we went up to the principal, ect) so we were happy when they broke up because we thought one of them would confess. She was crying. I didn't know how much breakups were supposed to hurt. (Note: nothing bad happened at our school, just the threats. Nobody knows who wrote them.)

This one I feel the worst about. She and her bf broke up and she was bawling her eyes out for like 2 days. I wanted to show the ex-bf how much he was hurting her, so I wrote a letter to him ""from"" her. Not the best move but I was confused and naive at the time. I ended up switching the to and from names and it got given to her. I've never been so guilty and never seen someone so sad. I tried to apologize and make up, and she let me. She told me ""we're square"" and we never talked again after I did what she asked me to so we could be even.

I feel like such a dick and I never meant to hurt her but here I am. I would quite literally do anything, even sexual (again, I'm asexual. I've literally had nightmares about sex). She said we're square but I know we aren't and its been a few years but I feel so guilty I hope I never do anything like that again. I don't think I'll even be able to forgive myself and I'm now depressed but I totally deserve it for what I did. I may've been young, confused, and finding my identity, but that isn't an excuse for what I did.

Sorry for the length and sorry Emelia.",0

"A bit of backstory but I went through a very bad stage from May 2022 to roughly March 2023. I was self inflicting, and had several attempts that didn’t work. I would scream that I wanted to end things when I was having a bad episode. Around Christmas, I told my mum and she helped me sign up to counselling, all was fine and well, I finished counselling around late March early April and I felt so much better, even though it was still brewing and I still have that sudden urge and feeling that I’ll go back to that state.

Ever since then I’ve been very angry, I’ve been crying a lot more, I get irritated and frustrated over every little tiny thing which causes me to lash out at my loved ones. I’m struggling to figure out why.

How can I deal with my emotions without lashing out? How can I stop myself from feeling this way?

I always end up feeling guilty about it and it makes my family look at me in a way that hurts. ",0
"With trump being shot and basically securing a massive landslide to win

I genuinely don't see a point anymore. I live in Australia and our poltics always reflect amercias so next year I'm sure libreal (right wing party) will win and get into parliment and even if they don't it will probably be labour (slightly less right wing)

I look at whats happening in gaza and Congo and ukraine and just can't process how the fuck I'm supposed to do anything to help.

I'm bi and nonbinary i was amab so already life is hard to a degree but i also live rural so if right wing parties get in all over the worlf my life is done for I'd have to go back to suppressing myself because the world just simply refuses to have empathy for people thay don't feel and look like them.

I'm also a musician but i suck ass most of my songs are just mish mashs of grunge songs i like and even ones i think i completely original end up sounding like another band. My lyrics are bland my guitar playing sucks .

I have a slew of undiagnosed shit and i dont know whats actually wrong with me. 

My friends all live 2 states away and i only see them 2 times a year. I work for macdonalds because  its the only place in my town that doesnt pay under the books that hired me. I have made 0 friends in 2 years and every time i try im let down. Recently me and this girl i was helping cheat fell out and her bf at the time revealed how much she was lying to me about and i was fine with it because i didnt like him but after we sat down and talk i couldn't find reasons to hate him and i jjst feel so fucking guilty


Ive come from the right wing 15 year old boy pipeline all the way and yet it feels like for all my changing all im doing is just trying to makeup for shit i did in the past. Ive tried so hard to help the people around me change and research and as soon as i think im maming progress something happans and all that progress is lost. 

I just feel so hopeless and like every step of progress is just another step back

Capatlism is destorying me i find it so hard to work even a simple job because i just want to be alive without the stress of needing money for stuff.

Ive made plans to aquire euthanasia drugs and to kill myself at a park up from my house. My friend tried to talk me down but in my head its just a burning thought even if i dont want it. Ive struggled witj impulsive thoughts alot but this one isnt impulsive it just wont leave.

"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was about 13 (now 25f). 

Disorders peak and I feel lower than I thought was possible, they settle and I can breathe a little better and say ‘yes’ to things again. Peaks are more frequent. Peaks have made me say ‘no’ to opportunities and people to the point of ruining almost every professional prospect and losing all but couple of friendships. 

I’m in my rumination era. All my ‘no’s have caught up to me, I spend most of my time by myself because of them. The loneliness is so big. I spend most of my time physically and mentally motionless because the feeling (or lack thereof) takes up all my open spaces. 

How do you all deal with loneliness? Do you feel isolated by your depression and anxiety? Is there a way to move through, or away from, all of it and build a life again? I don’t often ask for advice, but I guess I’m in my “please help” era too.

"Well, periodically I end up posting back here, whenever I feel like things getting better, shit always end up hitting the fan somehow.

I'm convinced that we are just brought into this planet to make other's lives miserable for no reason. If my own family isn't willing to support the real me, how can I be sure that the rest of people will accept me?

Whenever I find a semblance of happiness, there's always some douchbag gleefully awaiting the moment to take that from me. The idiot of my father doesn't have empathy for me and still claims that he loves me. I didn't get to choose to be born the way I am, I didn't have a choice about the decisions I took. It was either ""that"" or killing myself, thing that I'm really considering again.

I've been dealt a shitty hand and people around me have somehow made my hand worse. If my experiences taught me something, it's that transitioning isn't hell, people around you make it seem like hell.

So picture this, you need to get over your own dysphoric thoughts and also tolerate the insensitive comments of the people that are supposed to love you the most.

I'm stuck living as a dude while doing hrt and my fucking environment won't let me to socially transition. Fucking conservative Catholics, I despise them, they literally put my family against me with their idiotic ideologies. For them I'm nothing more than a dude wanting to wear dresses or a weirdo.

If I could just move out I would have done it by now, but my salary is so shitty and rents are so ludicrously high that that's not an option. I feel trapped in my own body and trapped by my environment, I just want out.

I'm so depressed that I would gladly take my life or someone else's in the process. I'm so angry and resented at everything that I would like to watch the whole world burn.

I wouldn't wish my situation upon anyone, it's literal torture and also to add insult to injury, I was ""suggested"" to leave hormones for a year. Do you know how that would affect me? I would literally snap faster as my mental health would take an even worse nosedive. I've tried it before so I know by personal experience that it's a terrible idea.

So to wrap up my torture porn biography, I may end up or being homeless or deleting myself. Idk, at this point I don't care, I just want to be left alone.",1

"I am in my thirties and was diagnosed with severe depression on december, 2023. What broke me and made me go to the psychiatrist was that my ideation day failed, not for mental reasons. I couldn't work, eat and for the first time in my life I felt lonely.

I am on meds since then. In march I felt really good, never in my whole life I felt so good, could think better, talk better, could describe if food was good or bad, and for the first time I had a moment in my life that I could describe as happiness. I was able to go do lots of exams (bloos test), everything is good. Walked for 4 hours in one day. Wrapped a birthday gift for my best friend. Could describe how good or bad a food was, never been a picky eater. Went out with all my friends. Was able to do 6 sets of all my workout routine everyday in 1 hour, 12 exercises divided in 3 supersets. Cleaning my whole house was easy.

The best expression to explain it was cloud nine.

One month later, things got worse again. Less energy, harder to concentrate and think, harder to do basic things, crying more, went to 6 sets everyday to 3 sets and then 1, and somedays I wasn't able to workout. I go out with my friends and feel nothing, on that stage that no one wants to see that I am not good, so I just pretend that things are okay.

Doctor increased meds and changed to ""stronger"" and expensive meds. It has been 3 months and It didn't get better. Some weeks ago someone recomended L Citrulline and helped a bit, but not extraordinary.

I am losing my hope, I feel that the ""feel good phase"" wasn't normal and I will never experience it again. I am currently off work since december, not receiving any money from my country social service. I will run out of money in some months, and planing a date again.

I am posting this because in my lurking experience here and on other social medias, I have never seen anyone describe that feel good moment that lasted only days or weeks.

I know that people like to say that it will get better and that I am still on the beginning of my treatment, I am here to read this.

Please be honest, if you have severe depression, did you had this experience? Were you able to feel that again? And what other non conventional (not breaking any post rules) made a difference?",0
"In a few hours my partner and I will get together and talk. My addiction has damaged our relationship since it stared but he has been there with me.

We love eachother more and better than before because now we can see a future together.

But I went out on saturday and relapsed. He said to me that if that happened again he was done. He couldn't deal with it anymore. I could have hidden it but believed (and I still do) that telling him was the right choice. 

I don't know what will happen but I know this. The idea of loosing him for blow, for not having had the strength to leave The party or ask for help because i will always want to do blow. That's part of the problem. I know if he decides to go I will fall apart. Life doesnt feel right already. I'm scared and thinking of the things i'll do if we split. I don't know.

We're weird crazy and so much other things that people describe us but who are we really? I come to the conclusion we don't knew ourselves we are so lost. We were just a kid who have the hope and cling to the promises that we might change the world someday. 

Please don't be like me, Dont be a frustrated daydreamer and a procrastinator. I've done enough self sabotage that I can't bounce back. Someone might say you can do it, I did it myself too. They're not on your shoes they never knew how much you suffer enough to be accepted for who you're or how much you suffer to be deemed as normal. 

It might be ironic and humorous cause I myself suffered and ending it today. But I hope for someone like you who read this, Tell the world to fuck it and shut thier mouth. ",1
Or just maybe shoot myself hihih. Idk what I'm doing with life atp. I'm so filled with self hatred and all I could think of is just how much death could feel so liberating. I also have no idea what was the point of writing this here. Guess I'm just so lonely and I just wanna talk about this. But yea if I'm not so scared of death I'd probably kill myself by now.,1

Not really asking y’all’s standards but I guess I am too idk hope y’all can either use this post to rant or give out some information or connect to it at all.",0
"in my whole life, as much as i could try, i could never succeed in anything.  
An entire life of being a loser and an idiot to people who'll always think i am beneath them (family as much as friends , colleagues and strangers) i always try to be good and do good things but i always end up regretting being too nice to others at the end.  
I can't do anything normally , i can't speak properly without stuttering or mispronouncing easy words, i can't stand still without moving any part of my body in any direction possible and i can't maintain a basic human conversation , i feel like just some guy to my friends and a nuissance to everyone and can understand that maybe without my presence things would be less complicated for others.  
I also wished i was not as stupid as i am and didn't had the attention spend of a goldfish , i can't understand most instructions correctly even when i my best.

I’m going to end up posting on here every day for the rest of my life. Someone just kill me. It seems so impossible to find a way to succeed in doing it myself. How do people do it and sometimes at such a young age. I legitimately wish someone would try and rob me or something and I’d just ask them to shoot me. I can’t go on.,1

I'm a crybaby, most people just keep going but every time I just think about how nice it'd be if I were to slit my throat and get it over with, I just complain and cry about my problems as if they mattered.",0
"My ex (wlw relationship for context) was arrested for felony DV. I was the victim. She hit me with a truck and gave me a traumatic brain injury. I have permanent brain damage for the rest of my life. She attacked me with a knife, she called me r*tarted knowing I’m diagnosed autistic, she said I deserved to be r*ped. A lot of it I have on video. I even have her on video confessing to the abuse and saying if I told anyone she’d k*ll herself or me. She got away with the abuse a lot because I would call the cops and she’d attempt suic*de so they’d have to take her to the hospital instead of arresting her. She used her mental illnesses as an excuse for her behavior. She blamed it on bpd and schizophrenia. She even blamed me. She got probation and they will remove the felony once she completes probation. I feel completely robbed of justice. I live in constant mental and physical pain from what she did. Everyone is telling me to move on but it’s hard when my disabilities SHE GAVE ME affect me every day. I want to just die and end this. She’s broken the restraining order multiple times and the cops won’t do anything. 

She manipulated me for so long like saying it was my fault for getting hit with the truck bc I ran after my car after she stole it but I was on the side walk.  Doesn’t matter if I was doing backflips on the side walk if you run off the road and ran someone down on the side walk that’s your fault yk? She said it was my fault she stabbed me with a knife bc she was trying to off herself not me. She’s telling everyone I was the problem.  Even despite it being on video and her being found guilty in criminal, civil, and military court she STILL won’t take responsibility. It’s so hard to move on when someone is doing stuff like that and won’t even acknowledge what they did. 

I have nightmares about her.  Every night she’s haunting my dreams. Sometimes I dream she apologizes, and that’s when I know it’s just a dream.  

I want to die I want to end this suffering. I hate myself for staying with her for so long. I hate what she did and what she continues to do. Yet I still mourn the life I dreamed of having with her.  To top it all off the trauma of that made me develop bipolar disorder. Fml ",1

"I swear I'm cursed or something. Bad shit keeps happening to me, it's not been a very good few months already and now I've got to deal with this too. 

I've had symptoms of bowel cancer for a while now, but I just assumed it was something else since I'm young so I ignored it. Last week the symptoms got so unbelievably bad that I had to see my doctor. I was hoping for something simple but he ruled out hemorrhoids or a fissure an had me do a FIT test. I maxed out that test, literally as high as it could measure. There's only a couple diseases that can cause that result, and the only one that matches my symptoms is cancer. I'll have an endoscopy soon to confirm though.

Ive almost certainly got cancer, at 23 years old. Ill probably lose all my hair from chemo and look like a man. They might have to cut out parts of my bowels. I might need a permanent colostomy bag. Maybe it's spread to other parts of my body and I'm basically dead already.

I am so fucking scared. I just want to give up, I don't want to go through all that pain. I've tried to kill myself over less, and I'm finding right now that it's a very attractive option.",1

"I had a falling out with a guy I was talking to a while ago and Ive still been pretty upset and confused about the situation because he sent a lot of mixed messages claiming that he cared about me but acting another way. I asked my friend what his take was and he just said that the guy just didn’t care that much and “If people care enough they will act in a way to show that and think about the other person when trying to show it so that the other person can be aware of their efforts.” So I said “that would mean you didn’t care much about me either.” He said yeah and went on to say he cares more about other things but doesn’t mean he has 0 care for me. He hasn’t treated me that great in the past and I have a history of abuse and a lot of toxic relationships where I was treated poorly, so this stung a lot. It made me reevaluate a lot of my relationships in the past and I realize that most people in my life have not really cared about me. It’s hard to accept and I’m struggling a lot with this. I really need help and advice or something to get through this. ",0

The shit he talk about makes me even less feel like a human I'm in a constant state of derealization it always feels like I'm not connected to myself anymore. I don't like it anymore I just hope it gets better when I'm away from my parents. No actually my mum she hates me she never spent time with me. She always argues with me. They will move soon and she forces me to help them because if I don't she will cut me out of her will. But I can't help she wants to renovate the old house of my Grandma but it's basically a ruin.

I have no will to live I have no energy I'm a 1,77m girl with 45kg I can't help renovate a house for half a year with no free time. I work every day till 6. I just turned 18 and she expects me to move even though I won't have time. I hate her. The only though that keeps me going is that maybe I'm in the right and she's terrible. But idk I'm wrong I'm horrible I'm a lazy asshole. But I still hate her more she tells me my bf is a narcissist all the time. He's a bit stupid but not a narcissist and she talks in on me for hours daily she won't stop till I agree he's an asshole. Or that I'm an asshole. I've not once argued with her. And if I get mad she tells me that I have anger issues. Everything just seems dark and cloudy and I just want to sleep but she will make jokes about me when I sleep so long.

"I haven’t seen many people say this. I know it’s not just me but, being depressed feels like waiting to die, a slow miserable death, being happy you’ll die someday. I can’t wait to die, honestly its going to be the best amount of dopamine i’ve ever recieved, im done trying to OD it never works, instead I will do anything and everything possible to make my body as weak and disgustingly fragile as it can be, it’s not suicide if you don't die the same day, right?

"I'm 28, had to move back in with my parents last year, and lost my girlfriend 6 months ago. I have so many regrets from my past, like quitting two different career paths which has led me to this point of being broke. And me being broke heavily contributed to losing the woman I thought I'd marry. 

Many people will say don't worry about the past, it can't be changed. Instead focus on be future. Well, I'm going back to school and will have a career that pays 70-130k depending on where I go in the country. It's not bad money, enough to live and maybe even afford a modest home, but I'll never be wealthy from it. I'll have to save and invest and work until I'm old just to have a chance at retiring. My time will never be my own, I'll be a wage slave my whole life. I have very little hope of being happy in the future, but I'm approaching 30. I can't keep putting off a career. 

""Okay then,"" some might say. ""Just focus on the present."" How can I do so with no money, no one to love and cherish, and no hope for the future? The only thing that's kept me alive are my friends. I'm thankful every day that I'm not as lonely as many other depressed people are. But it's not enough... not whenever I feel like my life is out of my control and my future is so uncertain.

I no longer have any friends and my family doesn't know if these thoughts, as I hide them pretty well after 15+ years of practice, so I'm all alone... And frankly speaking I deserve nothing more. Happiness is a privilege that a thing as selfish, useless and disappointing as me does not deserve.

I've been to therapists and on medication but nothing works. It feels as if depression has become my default state, so ingrained in my personality that I can't see myself existing without it.

I was supposed to die 5 years ago now and I'm just living past my expiration date to avoid the pain I would cause to my relatives.

Took months to recover and it knocked me back a long way. No confidence to try as I was told it would be futile. Now my liver has started to pack in due to being so overweight (100kg, 175cm) - I’ve already been told this was the sole reason for the heart attack.

Wife didn’t say that we hadn’t paid our tax bill, I know it was my responsibility, but she had always dealt with it so I didn’t worry. Now we owe £70k and cannot pay it back.

"my boyfriend is not abusive. he has been mean to me on many occasions but never hit me or emotionally abused me. he recently said he wanted to break up with me because we spend too much time together and he needs to grow as a person. we settled on taking a break. he said i can still talk to him when i want to. he still comes over and we cuddle. he said im not allowed to keep tabs on him and im not allowed to spend the night with him. he still asks me on dates or to hang out. i’m basically his gf without the commitment. but it is supposed to be temporary until he heals and figures things out. 

currently, he doesn’t answer my calls or text me. he is distant unless he thinks we can have sex. whenever i bring up that his control over every aspect of this relationship is making me miserable, he starts to threaten a complete break up again. when we do spend time together he basically leads me on. he tells me and he loves me and everything is going to be okay. we make future plans and i feel like everything is going to work out. but then he ghosts me all day. i have my own problems. i take care of his dog and cat. i have depression and anxiety and am currently struggling financially. i have no friends and my family doesn’t like me. everyday is a struggle. 

when he does talk to me on the phone, he always tells me things like he doesn’t want to be in a relationship with me. he constantly tells me that he doesn’t like to be around me. he tells me that he doesn’t miss me and that he doesn’t want to see me. he knows i have struggled with suicidal thoughts, depression, and anxiety. he is always flipping between saying he loves me and saying he doesn’t want to be around me. he makes me feel like i’m not worth it. he makes me want to kill myself. out of everyone who doesn’t want to be around me or love me, i never thought he would become one of those people. i don’t say anything to make him say this stuff. he just feels the need to. i feel like it’s manipulative for me to tell him that the things he says and how he is treating me is making me suicidal. but i just want to make him stop

I've been suffering for so long and my family KNEW something was wrong with me. Instead of being proactive they just let it fester and now that it has gotten this bad they refuse to deal with me. 

What hurts is that NONE of them will tell me the truth. Even when I ask. They will tell me I'm over thinking only to literally talk shit about me for HOURS on in about how crazy I am about how sick I am. Forget all the bad shit they have ever done to me right. How do you cope when everyone you love hates you. How am I supposed to handle this.

I came back this summer for vacation and we spent a few days together last week before she went back to school.
I could tell she was feeling down. She has lost a lot of weight since I saw her. I noticed she developed an ED and tried my best to make her eat more. 
Yesterday I went on Snapchat and saw her story she made about her healing journey from depression.
Turns out, she's been extremely depressed and self harming. According to her this is not the first attempt but the 32nd.
As I was scrolling through I felt like a failure for not recognising the obvious signs. And at the end of her story she said she relapsed again and goodbye for the last time.
She sent me s snap of her arm attached to an IV (I saw this before her Snapchat story) I called her several times she didn't pick up.
She just replied to me that she's hospitalised for attempt and that she'll call me later.

I have no idea what to say to her to help her. We are separated by cities and I don't think her parents know about it. I'm scared to tell them because it will feel like I'm breaking her trust and sharing something she doesn't want to share.

I understand her a little since I had multiple suicidal thoughts myself but never had the courage to go through with it.

"Hello (14M), growing up as a child who has adhd and living in an unsafe environment with plenty of kids, even adults making fun of me. Here, my abusive and alcoholic dad who physically abused me because of my disabilities has ruined my brain permanently.

He went to rehab for 2 years back in 2020... When he got back i thought it was over now... Till he cheated on my mom... And when she found out... She confronted her...

They fought... Infront of me... We were eating dinner that time... They don't even know i was there... It's just screaming and yelling... As i eat...

They didn't get a divorce... Instead they just lived in our house without talking to each other... Some other fights along the way...

They eventually sort it out and decided to live in a much safer area... I was extremely happy that time when i heard that I'll be leaving the place I almost died on...

When we moved... I made plenty of friends along the way and even went in a band... I hit puberty there... It was good... The place is quiet... It's a safe place for me... if only I can live there for the rest of my life... I can't tho...

2 years had passed, 2024. Turns out that my parents are going to sell the house and we need to go back from that shitty place I used to live on...

My whole world shattered... My stomach dropped... All the healing I did... Gone in a blink of an eye... I begged for them not to do it but they did... I wished it was dream... My friends... My school... My home... They took it away from me...

When we got back to our house... I get frequent flashbacks from the past... It felt so uncomfortable... It felt... Scary... I can't believe I'm back here... Even the school i transferred to... It's haunted... I'm scared of what's going to happen to me here...

Present day, i don't go out anymore... I drown myself on caffeine... Like energy drinks and coffee... I only go out when I have to... Like school, buying stuff from the grocery... I sometimes wish i was dead already and if i should just end it all... I think I'm doing a pretty good job of doing things that could kill me... Like drinking as much energy drinks asi can... not sleeping for 3 days... sleeping in the bathroom... but these doesn't do its job... I'm still fine... 

I go and tried to change the look of my room... And threw out the things that reminded me of the past... But I still get it... My mind is going crazy... This is torture for me... The only way I can interact to my friends is through online...i really miss them... I cry almost every night... It's my 5th month here... 

I got myself my first girlfriend... But that didn't end well and I just got mad at her suddenly and started calling her names and other hurtful stuff... I regret doing that... I didn't know why I even did that... I just came out of me... We only got together for 2 months and my unstable sense of self has led me to push her away... And regret it 3 hrs after when it's too late...

I failed almost every of my class but still manage to be able to go through the next school year... Next week I will be in 10th grade now...

I'm aching just to feel like home... Back to where i belong... I didn't know that... Happiness is temporary... But you can't force yourself to be happy... You have to find what makes you happy... But I can't... 

Writing this got a lot out of my chest... ",0
