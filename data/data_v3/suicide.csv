"We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",1
"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",1
"My husband attempted suicide yesterday. We got into a huge argument and I left at around 1:30 to go get our son from my grandparents house, which is 3 hours away. While I was gone, he texted me saying “im about to die.” I called his mom and told her what he said and asked her to check on him. He took some pills and im not exactly sure what happened when she found him but I only knew something was wrong when I checked her location and they were at the hospital. I called her and she told me that they were at the hospital, but nothing else. I drove as fast as I could back home but the ER sent me home saying he couldn’t have visitors. He’s on an involuntary hold now and waiting to be transferred to a mental health facility. His mom is blaming me because of our fight. I am struggling to wrap my head around everything going on. I genuinely feel like im losing my mind. I’m struggling to keep up with our toddler and im currently pregnant with our second child. My life feels like a nightmare. I don’t know what to do..",1
"This is gonna be a long story. So tldr at the end. Wanted to type this all out. 

I grew up in a very religious and conservative environment. I was indoctrinated into this religion from a very young age. Not to mention that the entire society and culture was structured to be very conservative as well. This included very little to no interaction between the boys and girls. From a very young age, our schools were segregated as well. 

It was in this all boys school/environment where I started to develop my understanding of sex. It was not a good environment to do that. Things were super toxic. Sex and porn were constant topics in the classroom. The school was so bad at handling all of this that almost our entire classroom was watching pornography in the IT lab. Even with the professor being there sometimes. There were kids who would jerk off in the class sometimes or show their penises to each other. Something that I partook in as well. I remember our library lesson was also mostly about this subject. We would get the biology textbook and go to the chapters about reproduction. But it was not just reading, other students had drawn profane images on the book. So we would look at them and perhaps make our own contribution. 

This was also the time when pornography became a thing in my personal life. It's difficult to remember how much was there but there was plenty of it. Being from a conservative environment, conversations about sex was a taboo. So my introduction and understanding of sex was solely developed through pornography and my school environment. My parents never talked about it. Many years later, my dad only briefly mentioned something about wet dreams but that's about it. 

This early part of my life I vehemently hate. Most people find their childhood innocence something that they cherish. But I didn't have that I suppose. I hate this part of my life so much that if I can go back in that, I'd kill that part of me.

Sometime after, I moved out of this school to a co-ed school. Things got better. My outlook improved. I struggled to make female friends though. And there was a lot of shame and guilt associated with even trying because of my religious upbringing. I remember one time, our school had an event and one of my female classmates tagged me in a post on Facebook. I did not have any privacy on my account so my dad saw it. And he got very angry at me, even though I never asked her to share it and the picture wasn't even with me and her, it was of the entire class. My dad forced me to block that female classmates on Facebook. 

This school was in a more progressive city. So kids were in relationships. And I remember being very intrigued by that idea. Intellectually I always thought that dating and relationships were a good way to know your partner and if they fit. But I thought that God knew better and I should stop thinking these stupid thoughts. But I knew to stay away from it. However, this was the place where I developed my first really bad crush. I liked her so much. But the purity values of my religion always made me feel bad about even thinking about holding her hand, let alone anything else. I used to take pride that my thoughts about her were pure. That when I'd day dream about her I would never think about holding her hand or kissing her, even after marriage (in my head). I felt awful about watching pornography because of the same reasons so I started trying to avoid it. And I did. I would not watch porn or jerk off for six months. This also became my first experience with rejection but that's a separate story. 

Eventually I entered university which was one of the most liberal universities in my country. I had heard stories about people being in relationships and having sex and I had heard about my parents concerns about that with me. So I decided to avoid having relationships. I did want to have female friendships, to improve myself and my confidence with talking to girls. Also, to further improve my view on women and topics like gender roles. Due to growing up in a religious family, I had a very patriarchal view on these subjects. Nevertheless, I felt lonely and I craved romantic love and affection. This was also the time when pornography re-entered in my life. But I hated myself for watching it. I was ashamed of being someone who interacted with pornography, especially on somewhat regular basis now. Which for me meant once a week. 

University was also the place where I started getting suicidal. I never tried to kill myself but I started self harming, and the methods for worse and more extreme. When I graduated from University, I left with all these feelings with me. The suicidal ideation, the self harm, the shame and guilt, and the loneliness. 

All these feelings got worse. Eventually, through some reflection and realizations. I left the religion behind. And I felt betrayed. I thought It always made sense to me that relationships (even ones that involved pre-marital sex) were not bad. But I never allowed myself to think that. But also, I realized that a religion that focused on purity had none itself due to our various injunctions. At this point, I grow a desire to explore this side of me and thought to turn towards paying for it. But I stopped myself. The most I did at that point was buy lube for the first time to know what that feels like. 

However, I wanted to try my luck at relationships and I did. Even in cases where I knew pre-marital sex was not possible (due to their beliefs), I thought if they accept me as a irreligious person, I don't mind. At this point, my parents also were pushing to get me married. My family has a lot of marriages done to improve business ties with other families. So now that we were of age my dad wanted to do that too. However, I declined...many times. I declined often enough that at one point my dad insulted me by saying that ""are you gay?"" (For context, being from a very religious culture and country, people here very strongly hate LGBTQ people... Including my family). Regardless, I tried the to enter into a relationship for two years. 

While I tried to make sure the intention was to be in a relationship and not to have sex (I would give myself extra time to reflect on this). Near the tail end of this time period, things started to feel muddled. I felt like I wanted to know what that felt like and I felt bad for being a virgin at 25. I felt even worse for consuming pornography and that being the only sexual outlet I had ever had. This went on for a while. 

Recently, these feelings become heightened. And I wanted to experience what it was like and I wanted to get this feeling out of my system. So I had sex with a prostitute. And I hate myself even more now. 

I hate that I did it. I feel like I've ruined myself. Despite intellectually not having any problem with sex work or sex workers in general and not judging others who I know have done the same. I can't help but feel awful about myself. Since it happened, I can't help but feel constantly anxious and depressed. And if I was suicidal before, I can't help but feel that after this, I have to go through with it. I have to. And I feel like it's about time that I wipe my wretched self off this planet. I have been thinking about this ever since it happened. I feel so done with life. I already wrote my suicide note and goodbyes a while ago. It would be kinda funny to write an update. So I feel like all I need to do now is pull the trigger. 

Thank you to everyone who made it till the end. I appreciate you reading my ramblings. 

Tldr: I always had a weird and unhealthy relationship with my sex life and sexuality. I recently had sex with a prostitute and I hate myself for it. I have been suicidal before but I feel like at this point I'm done with my life. I already wrote my suicide note and goodbyes a while ago and I feel like I just to need to plan my death and get this over with.

"Ive already overdosed, and caused other issues, but to refrain from being too graphic. I have 2 days maximum left. Too get everything out the way, I cannot get to a hospital (I  am more afraid of my family then death), no  there is no chance of survival, bodys past repair.   
why? Alot frankly, I have been groomed multiple times in my life and was raped by my ex for  a  year, with my current partner sexually exploiting me too.   
My family have always been emotionally andd verbally abusive, threatening to disown me for any action they did not like, for eg me speaking before I was spoken to. my family will always argue which raised me to have terrible anger issues, these issues then pushed away all my friends as I genuinely do not know how to respond  to emotions, so ill just blame, scream, and cry, meaning besides my exploitive  ex, I have no one.   
I was bullied and ostrasiced from every circle as a child, which did not help my issues, however its not fair to blame kids/ teens for any of this.   
I am mentally  unable to work or function due to things like ADHD, however  due to my family not allowing me  medication nor therapy,  it is not gettinng better.  
ontop of this I am trans, a minor note but the dysphoria hurts, extremely bad, my family makes a note to put me down over it

I have nothing left, I love this world, and I want to  see people happy. However I do not, and have never caused joy nor happiness.

I just want someone to remember me, I can give more context + information in a couple hours, if anyone replies

  
but I  cannot live as a bad person  anymore, and being physiically unable to get help makes my situation impossible 

love yall, and those who peruse this subreddit replying to posts, youve probably helped more people then you could imagine,keep up the amazing work, you are truly invaluable, just as everyone is",1
"It's been a rough week. 1 year ago my 1 year old kitten, was hit by a car and died. I found out days later when her body was brought to me, and while crying I burried her in my garden. It's 1 year later, and now, her sister, my other kitten, is dead. She was only 2 years old, and she was hit by a car. I once again cried buckets while burrying her last week. 

Now, I feel alone, I feel hurt and nothing seems to make me happy. I watch something, I think about how she would lay down with me to watch something with me. I play video games, I think about how she'd come in and relax with me. I lay in bed, I think about how she'd come in and jump onto my bed, demanding to be pet and scratched. Everything I do is just overtaken with thoughts of what my cat would do while I do these things. 

It hurts, it hurts so much. 

And I just want it to stop. ",1
"All I’m good for is sex. People only want me to get off. Ever since I was 8 people have only wanted me to fuck me. I’m a bit drunk right now but not drunk enough to feel better evidently. I want to hang myself. I am too mentally ill to have a normal life. Can’t get a job even at like beginners places like McDonald’s and shit. I’m in the UK so college year 2 will be September I don’t know if I’ll get into year 2 until August. Probably won’t because of my mental issues. 

So I’ve been doing sex work. Today is the lowest I’ve felt in a while. I was asked why I do what I do so young and I said breifly how I was sexually harassed from a young age and need the money so I used the fact everyone sexualises me to my advantage. He liked this a lot was telling me how he has a “CNC” and “Age” kink and the fact I was sexually abused as a child turned him on more. 

Which is gross but I still went on with it. Now I’m the most suicidal I’ve been in a while. I want to hang myself. I don’t want my real abuse to be mixed in with ‘work’. 

I want to die. I hate myself. It isn’t hot to me. I just feel guilty. I know it’s my fault but I still feel hopeless. I know if I kill myself it’s not a big deal. Everyone will cheer especially if they find out how much of a slut I am. I want to die. I’m only ever wanted if someone wants to get off. ",1

"I started self harming again. It's not healing very well, I guess it's a side effect from being sick and on tons of medications.  
  
I don't even know what to say. Can't pay my rent, so my landlord told me that he will throw me out if I don't fix it in a few days. I can't. I've looked at everything that I could possibly do, sleeping in shelters, getting help from my doctor and social worker, but no. They can't.

So I'm going to be sick, be on medicines and sleep outside. I feel like I want to end it now. What's the point? I have no family, no friends, I have no one. Not exaggerating, I actually don't have anyone.

I can't do this. What's the point? I going to be in so much pain. I want to die.

There has been so much shit in my life. Abused, mother who hit me and was on drugs, she was p\*do and liked wo touch me and force me to watch p\*rn with her when I was 6-12. I was attempting suicide at 10 years old, doctors, mental institutions, abuse...

My father killed himself last year by using a **chainsaw** on a barrel with oil inside. It blew up. He had no face. He died. He abused me as much as my mother did. But the way he chose to die.. it's disgusting.

"When people tell me that ""others will be hurt"" if I was to die, is a very invalid arguement to the depressed in my view. First off, if I'm super depressed, do you really think I'm gonna care about what other people will think/feel? No. And second, I find it unfair to continue living my life in depression for the sake of ""making others happy"" when said people rarely even reach out to me or reach back if I initiate. So like, remind me again how my absense would make ""that big of an impact on others"". Simply just on less empty seat at dinner, like Ive always been my life. Just a lonely empty seat.",1
I just don't know what to do at this point. I've been so proactive in seeking out mental health treatment but it's done absolutely nothing. Really just want to die so the pain goes away,1
"Recently I’ve realized that I won’t ever be a normal, functioning adult. I’m literally struggling with the most basic tasks in the world like brushing my teeth or doing laundry. Big cities are terrifying af and I hate crowds. I am super sensitive to sunlight and either always feel too hot or too cold, never at the right temperature. 

I cannot sit at a desk or on a chair like a normal person because my entire spine will hurt. Sitting in a car is a nightmare. Can’t enjoy most types of food or alcohol because my stomach is so sensitive lol. 

Feels like I was intelligent once but my brain broke a while ago and now i am dumb. Can’t even have proper conversations anymore. For years i had extreme anxiety but i think i finally wrecked my brain and now i’m emotionally dead, stopped caring about basically everything. If it weren’t for the fact that other people take care of most things for me i’d have kms years ago. 
I literally can’t do the most basic things ever and don’t think i’ll ever be able to. I was just not made for this world. I’m tired of pretending that i want to do any of this, just to die at some point anyway. Nothing successfully distracts me anymore. I want the void and the void wants me. 

My sleep schedule is complete garbage. Doesn’t matter if i have to wake up at 5am for weeks, the second i can ruin my sleep schedule again that’s exactly what happens, going to bed at 3 or 4am. My body wants at least 9hrs, tho it easily happens that i sleep 10-11 hrs. 
Sleeping is soooo good. Losing consciousness is literally the best feeling. That feeling of completely fading away before sleep, surgery, or passing out is the only good feeling in the world. I hate being trapped in a body, given that i’m almost always uncomfortable, in pain or exhausted, and i hate having thoughts. I really only crave nothingness now. How is someone like that supposed to live in this world? I’m just so tired of having to exist. 

Tbh, i’m convinced it’s a genetic thing. So many family members with mental illness. And it only gets worse with age. Might as well end it now before i make even more terrible memories and become even more of a burden.

"I have faults. SA’d for several years between 6~12, foster care for a couple years, abusive father ran out on us at 10, mom never around and rather have not had us as kids so she shut herself out of her life until we became adults. I made mistakes. I hurt people. My siblings being some of them. I kept people at a distance throughout school. 

I thought I came out on top. Made some friends, got engaged and married - went back to school. I patched up my relationship with my siblings. Had a daughter. I came out as trans in 2011~2013, and it all fell apart starting 2018. They said they were cool with it.. they weren’t. Everyone left me. I think some of the reason is because I’m fundamentally broken as a person. Idk. Disowned by spouses family, mother said I disgusted her. Dropped out of college. Spouse asked for divorce and announced a new partner in 5 minutes. I was angry sometimes throughout my marriage. Never abusive I just shut down and got quiet. I got depressed. They left me at that point.  Ex refuses to let me see my child. Suicidal ideation in 2019 landed them primary custody. 

I want my daughter. I want a family. I want friends.

On top of that I've had trouble breathing for a long time now, feels like I'm a 40+ years smoker when in reality I'm still young and haven't tried a cigarette in my life, sometimes it gets to a point where I'm spitting and tasting blood for a few days but also couldn't call it a huge problem since I don't do shit thus don't need to catch my breath a lot. In a similar note I've had a mole for some time now which looks like every example of sarcoma ever, more than 5mm wide, has different colours and irregular borders, it itches and I think it has grown a bit with time, and I've also noticed a few other new moles appearing where there was nothing before. Just hoping that something takes me already whatever it is but it's taking way too long, even if I feel like total shit every single day I cannot be sure what's causing it and I don't even remember feeling right, so who's to say that I won't have to stop being a coward and do the job myself. I don't deserve a merciful end, I do know that for sure. All that I can hope for in this moment, is that this gets automatically removed cause I don't seem to learn my lesson and shut my mouth when talking to people has only made matters worse through my life at best, something tells me that posting here yet again won't change that outcome.

Can't even remember how many times I've posted in here with this one just to later delete it, my stupidity is incompatible with life at this point.

Hope you can have a nice day, if you read this, it's not very uplifting lurking around here.",1
"I'm over it all. I've been alive and dead at the same time for 35 years. I've never felt alive. I've never enjoyed life. My whole life I've felt used and mistreated and none of the friends I've made have stuck around. They've moved on. Have their own friends and families. I haven't had a vacation in years. I'm so overworked and physically and mentally beaten, and I don't see it ever getting better. I'm trapped and the only way to free myself from this is to put an end to it all once and for all.

I opened up about this recently and was told it's a cowardly way to go, but fuck anyone who thinks that. I'm taking the power back that's been stolen from me. I'm finally taking the matter into my own hands, because it's either this or I go out burning everything down around me.

I'm choosing the peaceful path.

I've already donated or trashed all of my belongings, except for this phone, and quit my job. It feels nice to own nothing and be free from working, but I know that this feeling can't last for long.

I've already deleted all of my social media accounts except for this one, but after I hit post I'm deleting this account as well and destroying this phone and shortly thereafter ending this miserable life that's barely belonged to me.",1

"I feel like I have reached the end of my road

43m. Quit my job and was planning to live on my savings but some unfortunate things happened this month and half of money is now gone. I have no one to blame but myself. 

I don’t want to return to work but I think the bigger problem is that I feel like I have nothing to live for. No purpose. Not close with family. No friends. 

Even if I can get the money back somehow eventually but what for? I am just chasing a number and in the end I have no real purpose. Wish I can end it all but I am not sure I am capable of doing it.

Sorry for the rant. ",1
"I’m posting here because the detrans sub is already fucked enough as is.

I want to just fucking die already. I think about killing myself every day and it’s basically a constant loop. For context I was a “”trans kid”” and transitioned 15-19, ftmtf and HRT and a mastectomy. I fucking hate the trans community and the medical industry for encouraging minors to transition. I never got the help I needed and was basically brainwashed into thinking that I’d commit suicide without transition.

I was suicidal back then and now I’m exponentially more suicidal. I fucking hate being alive and always have. Transition was just medically assisted self harm and I realize now a huge part of my gender dysphoria was discomfort or trauma or whatever the fuck with being sexualized from a young age and internalizing that my body was a sex object for being female. I also fucking hate men and being around them. I especially hate my male surgeon, who operates on minors and is a Fucking freak. Literally the closest thing I can compare my mastectomy to is rape. That’s what it feels like. A middle aged man literally butchered me as a teenager and had his hands inside my body, and the sick thing is that he probably gets off to this shit. I don’t know what else to call it. These surgeons are complete sadists and snake oil salesmen. Literally fucking disgusting anyone does this shit to mentally ill teenagers.

I am basically nonfunctional at this point and I see no point in continuing to live. I would rather die than live like this for 50+ years. My only concern is my parents but I’m pissed at them too for being so stupid as to believe any of this trans shit. I don’t care if I’m perceived as transphobic. Trans people who encourage this mutilation for minors are fucking disgusting to me and I have nothing but complete contempt for them. I just want to die so I don’t have to suffer anymore. I can literally never have my old body back and it’s not like this is normal trauma. It’s some hellish abomination of medical experimentation/sexual exploitation/child abuse. The mental trauma of this experience is arguably worse than the physical trauma. It is literally impossible to deal with and I’m giving up.",1

"Please read my story. No one else did.

My name doesn't matter. My experiences only mattered to me. I'm a realist. I need to know that I finally had the courage to write my story.

If things look perfect on the outside, no one cares to see if it is true. Is it fear? Is that what stops everyone? 

I grew up nowhere. Six states. I lived in 6 states by the time I was 18. My family is great because of the money they make, right? I have four siblings. We must get along, right? You weren't abused. It's all in your head. Don't say anything. CPS? LIE. Don't you dare say a single word. Shhhhh. It gets better, right?

Mom and Dad do not love you. You are not enough. You have to be perfect. Remember when you got a B in geometry in 7th grade? Screaming and so much fear. I wonder why.

College was supposed to make it better, right? No, it's a cycle. You are the only thing in common. It's not the professor harassing you. You are just sensitive. And crazy.

Here's a psychward stay. It doesn't matter that this is the one time you didn't even feel suicidal. This is what happens when you ask for help. Here it is! But, where's my prescription? Oh, they didn't give me one. What was the point?

All you do is remember. You remember your first job? Second? Third? What about your internships? I bet you remember the one where you vomited out of fear every single day. No one could help you. Your boyfriend had your parents come up. Great idea, right?

You have been a ghost for months. Can't eat, can't sleep. When was the last time you looked in the mirror? You don't even want to shower. You don't want to get out of bed.

Holes in your teeth. Pain in your back every single second. Locked jaw. Is it enough yet? No one can protect you. No one did.

You are alone now. Everyone who promised to stay? They didn't. Your biggest fear was being alone. Now, you are. It never mattered how hard you tried.

Do you remember your first significant other? The girl who resulted in your parents disowning you? Love isn't worth it. She wanted one thing and she got it. It felt good, right? Gay people go to Hell.

21. You were never supposed to live that long. At 16, you wanted to end it. You should have listened. 5 years of pain. You don't have to listen to the people telling you that you are wrong. You are tired of hearing it. They say you don't deserve death. So yet again, you aren't enough.

You are ugly and fat. Your skin is bloody and scarred. You can't move without pain. Your voice doesn't even sound right. You have no clothes that are newer than 2 years ago. You have nothing to prove you are worth anything. 

I think you are. I think you deserve peace. It's inhumane to keep you alive. I don't love you, but I know you. You can't trust people. You can't speak. You are incapable of learning. You don't have to carry guilt. You're stuck in a dead end job with horrible pay. You made more at 17. 

If someone could tell me how, I would appreciate it. I've failed everything. I can't fail this. I won't get justice. If I'm dead, no one can pretend nothing bad happened. Please.",1
"My job at a DIY hardware store is making me suicidal.
There's so much toxicity, lack of effort from management and toxic management that it's making me suicidal.
Between the lack of understanding with my disability(orthostatic hypotension with vasovagal syncope) and them blowing payroll so much that I'm the only cashier all day for 9 hours....to guests cussing me out about said issue as if it's my fault.
I can't take much more...
The thing is...the money is good. I make over $18 an hour doing a simple job

But I travel an hour everyday to come to this job. 
Only to never be recognized for the hardworking and extra work I DO for said company.
I get treated worse than dog shit on a shoe...

"When people do nice things for me, it makes me feel really guilty and like a bad person. It makes me feel like I don’t do enough if i don’t do something nice in return. I am disappointed in myself. My friend called me today and told me she was dropping off a gift. I didn’t know what it was but immediately started feeling guilty. She dropped off a plant and some brownies because recently my grandfather passed away. It was such a kind gesture that i was almost brought to tears. But i feel so guilty. I thanked her profusely but i can’t escape this feeling.",1
" I just want you to know that I really tried, but I can’t enjoy life. 
my mental health is getting to a point that is torturing me 
there are some things that I used to love like my job, or painting and being with my dog ;
Sometimes I get distracted and I feel that I am happy and that I am part of something and that my life has meaning and I connect with people, but when I get distracted I become careless and I cannot control my impulses and my addictive personality; and I get in trouble, and I get others in trouble I have this disturbed side of me that is getting worse with the years.  
therapy and medicines do not help me a lot , I have tried many things, spiritual, terrenal, all on my possibilities , I have moved all over the place , I had pray , I had ask for help,  groups etc ... I don't know if it's me or the source, if I'm not doing it right, if I'm not trying hard enough. But each time I feel worse, I have read every article about what I have but I just find layers and layers of patterns that I don’t know how to heal  . Is like having cancer in my personality. And is always spreading and mutating into something else and it affects every aspect of my life , my relationships, my work, my mood, my sleep, the way I perceive the world , the way I perceive myself I don’t even know who I am . or what I’m doing here . 
it all started way before I was born , my dad wanted to have a family for all the wrong reasons. He is a narcissist psychopath 
He is a doctor but one that doesn’t believe in mental health. Of course he had never attended therapy and his diagnosis is based on the therapist of everyone else 
From the outside we looked like a good family but inside he terrorized me, and kept my mom around with manipulations and pregnancies. 
He had this big plans and expectations for me. That when I started develop my own personality he did make sure to crash it. He abused me and every way , he used to molest me since I can remember up to when I was 12 . He build a wall between me and my older sisters . Every day he didn’t miss the opportunity to remember that I wasn’t the son he wanted. 
I didn’t knew what was happening I just remember the fear and how uncomfortable was to be around him . 
At the age of 8 I began to have insomnia and fantasies about dying as a teenager became more accentuated and the nights terrified me because my mind was spinning in all directions; my mother tried to help me and took me to a therapist but I don't know what happened that I began to fall into a spiral of more abuse, addictions, suicidal thoughts, codependency, failed relationships, self-sabotage, low self-esteem, and now I am here at 36 acting like a teenager. I don't know if I lacked time to fully understand and be able to evolve. But now I feel like I have no way out and the negative consequences of my stupid decisions have caught up with me. I put myself over the edge so I had no other option but to jump. Because other times I regretted it or failed in the attempt, or I found the way out this time is different it feels very real. the constant use and abuse  that my father put me through definitely marked me, I guess is I’m my genetics , and the environment I grew up was perfect for me to develop this … I had blamed him I hated him. but it doesn't matter anymore, I am at peace with it. And I forgive him. 
now I know that at least my mother loved me after all. I don't want to carry resentments. I know that I was wrong many times and I ended up hurting people. And that is also why I made this difficult decision, I am afraid of causing serious or irreparable damage with my actions. Until now I was just a toxic person, I regret tormenting my mother and exposing my family with things that no one was prepared for, cheating on my partners and stealing things from stores. Telling lies , using people , I definitely had some narcissistic traits. And the guilty and shame is genuine. 
I am a coward for not facing the justice of man but I simply cannot conceive what it would be to go to jail, with the disorders that I have . 
I feel a fraud because everything I stole and that in the rush of adrenaline made me feel good, 
I don't want to damage the reputation of the program , I don’t feel like I should be around this kids anymore; I failed them, I failed everyone.
I feel like ending my life is the right thing to do. I've been planning and postponing it for years, 
I also did good things in life and I hope those things are enough for me to rest in peace I hope people remember me for those things for. My food, my jokes when I was in a good mood. My empathy for people with some difficulty. I want to take with me the good memories and the good deeds. It breaks my heart to know that I am going to hurt you and other people, because at the end of my days I realized that there were people who appreciated me and who saw me . And saw that I really tried …. ",1

"My boyfriend is struggling following the recent unexpected death of a sibling. Recently he’s been telling me about his suicidal ideation, how often he contemplates it, and how he wishes he could just die. I’m trying my best to create a safe space for him to speak about his feelings while also trying to encourage him to begin his healing journey but all my efforts seem futile. He is extremely stubborn and doesn’t believe in therapy, grief groups, journaling, or self help in general. He hasn’t been to work in months and spends his days moping on the couch. I’m trying to not let it show but it’s taking a huge toll on me. I’m afraid to go to work everyday while he’s here alone; im full of anxiety and just want him to be okay. Every night before bed I forgo any prayer I have for my self and just ask God to keep him alive. Any advice is greatly appreciated. ",1

I feel extremely alone and suicidal and i just wanted to express myself.

I really want to kill myself and i feel like im losing it. ",1
"I could type here and detail everything that’s bothering me, and maybe someone will understand. In no order, these are the things that bother, and add to my depression and anxiety. Dying alone, which at this point I see is more likely. I’m a very big morbidly obese guy that’s now losing weight because I’m getting semaglutide injections every Friday, it helps suppress hunger, and feel fuller sooner when eating. My mother died January 8, 2024, and I’m not only numb to it, I’m angry, upset, sad, and it took so much, and so much joy from my life. I already wasn’t experiencing much joy because of my own problems and issues, but that destroyed me. I now have to deal with my dad talking to a girl half his age, and 3 years younger than me(I’m 31). There was an incident last week where he called me around 7am asking if I could come over to be a witness as she was yelling acting crazy on the phone with him. Mind you, wtf is stopping this girl from lying saying my dad and me hit her. He asked me to come over because he thought she was bringing her cousin, and another woman, and he didn’t want it to be 3 against 1. I told him and had to check him on that cause my heart hasn’t pounded like that since the day my mom died. My car was in the shop, and the house my parents are living in is a few blocks over. Had to wake my brother up, to use his car because mines was in the shop. We zoom over there, and I hopped out the car fast to see what was going on as she just pulled up in my dad’s car. Oh he’s been letting her drive his cars now. I told him yesterday I felt a way about him letting her drive moms little Honda, I’m really sick of this shit, and want to move away. I’m trying to get my life together. I’m sick and tired of my feelings being fucked with. I’m on edge and want to be done with everything. No woman wants a big guy, it is what it is, and quite frankly I’m fucking tired of thinking about women. From all I’ve seen they just bring headache to lives, I rarely see a woman be a calm factor to a man, just my perspective and what I’ve see . My mom was the epitome of a headache. I went on a road trip yesterday and I kept thinking about my mom, and started to cry while driving but stopped myself quick, a few tears formed. 
I struggle to find shoes cause one foot is bigger than the other, and it’s going to take a long time to lose this weight. I feel like if I died now I wouldn’t have to worry about any of this bullshit anymore. ",1

"I’ve been up and down, and past experiences of family and co-workers I’ve discussed mental health with seem… dismissive? I was told a few times “if you’re talking about it, you’re not going to do it.” Discussing or bringing it up to a spouse feels awkward because you don’t want them to feel like they’re failing in anyway, they’re doing a great job and making you happy. But it’s an internal feeling of dread and the feeling of the only meaning of life is to die. So whats the point of living if you’re going to shrivel up and pass in your sleep or a hospice/hospital bed. Like it’s a little bit of a motivation killer. Not meaning to make this a long speech, just wanting to know if any of this is a valid feeling or not.

"Male (24) I'm seriously contemplating it. Pills. I stopped feeling like this just when on crisis, I'm feeling and thinking about it every day, calmly. How to do it, when, who to write a letter to, all about that.
I feel like I just messed up every relationship that I could have cared about, even with my family. Everything's tense, even with my little brother. So I feel like I'm just a burden. 

My parents always have seen me like a responsibility more than a son. My mother and I are way too explosive to each other, and recently, she is just indifferent with me, like resignated. My father and I don't talk, like, nothing that matters, he only asks me about work, or the ""Why did you do that, and not this..."" 

SOOOO, I'm just tired and I know I'm only a burden, and I'm not a safe place to someone, I'm not someone who a person feels happy seeing or talking to and I just can't seem to find a reason to keep going if I'm only going to bother everyone.

I told my mother about it and she just keeps saying that I'm playing a victim card, or if I talk about any ""Trauma"" from my childhood she literally do and Eye Roll and says ""Go ahead, talk about your traumas"" in a sarcastic and making fun of it, because ""Everyone has a trauma"".
So, I just don't see a motivation or something to go on.

But in January 2024 my bf broke up with me. This broke me, i thought i was going to get married with him. we had already talked about moving in this year. Things were serious. I got into therapy and started to work on myself. And for a moment it was working. I spent a lot in credit cards but then where i was working i had to quit. So i have a bunch of debt that i thought i could pay off fast.. I got my dream job after that but they let me go just in two months. Because of money cuts etc etc and they didn’t pay that well so im still with the debt. i tried dating someone new and i put up my walls because i was scared but i said okay. This new guy is way different and he seems like he’s really into me. But then he also left me. Im adopted and my adoption family treated me like shit so i don’t speak with them. My biological mother and i sometimes see each other but she moved on. Has a family with 2 daughters and basically gave them the perfect life. So i don’t really have a family. I dont have any close friends. I  don’t even have a college degree. And a whole lot of other trauma that i have when i was five and SA.

Any tips for a 100% suicide not anything where i might survive or have brain damage. Just fast and not as painful. Something also that i can do soon. I thought about buying a nitrogen tank but its kinda expensive and they don’t t sell you enough to die. Maybe overdose.. ive never done drugs so any tips would help. I thought as well drowning.

"I'm writing this in case I need it.

I think I'm getting close to the end of everything that needs to be done. I still go about, playing out my life, as if everything could be fine after all. I do it for those I love primarily. I cry still, but it mostly doesn't hurt. 'I'm sorry I left, but it was for the best, though it never felt right' - is a quote from Sufjan Stevens, from the song I'm listening to right now. It sums up what I feel pretty well. I've wanted to love, and be loved back, for so long. It's a simple thing, one which always comes for free, and yet I couldn't have it. 'The most expensive things in life come free'. That's another quote. I sometimes wished I'd had the courage to end everything earlier on, and other times I tried my best to keep going. For some reason. I was really proud of myself at times. But at last, there was nothing in my life but emptiness. I saw my boy, and his eyes were the most beautiful, the most perplexing thing ever. And then I spent my time doing nothing, watching the clock, waiting for everything to be over. 'To sleep.' he said, when I asked what he thought happened after death. 'You'll fall asleep.' I've spent many nights wishing I never woke up in the morning, being disappointed when Nothing ended. Perhaps when I forget myself at all, it will be a kind of peace. Perhaps not. Perhaps I see dreams in my forever sleep. I'm not sure I even want to make any arrangements for what is left behind of my existence. I told myself about a year ago, that I could die, of course, any time I wanted, but first I needed to finish up everything and anything I wanted or needed to do. It kept me going until now, which is impressive. But now I feel like it's finally coming to a finale. Perhaps I should talk to a priest and ask him to pray for my soul, so that God can welcome me with open arms when I pass. Perhaps I should tell my mother everything beforehand. I'm not exactly sure how to round this off, so this is it.",1

I've got nothing, no family, barely any friends, no one who will be there for me when I need them, I just don't see the point anymore. I'm tired of being alone and being so depressed. My cptsd just makes life unliveable, constantly one after the other I'm being triggered by something and the flashbacks are so intense they leave me emotionally drained for days.

  
I don't regret attempting but now I'm just left feeling like its only a matter of time till it happens again.

I'm just so alone, no one would miss me they'd just miss what I was able to do for them",1
"I always had moderate mood swings but give me a day or two and a shoulder to cry on and I would be fine. The problem was usualy bottling it up, but right now it is a bit different.
This year will mark the end of my first year of college and probably what was the longest time that I felt like hell.
I managed to get into a fairly good university in my country but once the classes started I immediately lost practically all motivation for everything. The studying for things that interested me before started to feel like Sisyphean work, I couldn't sit and pay attention in the class and I couldn't study at home. Only thing that helped me get through the first semester were a few friends that attended the same college, but as they improved and started to talk more about college, as most of the student's life starts revolving around it, I started to distance myself because I felt jelaous and bitter. Second semester went by not much better and for the most part of it I stayed in my room not having the will to go outside. Now it is summer I have one more chance to retake a few exams but I am unsure if there is even a point to it. I am not sure if I can even finish college or even if I do what will happen after it. I feel like my parents are disgusted by me even if they don't tell it to my face, they probably think I was a mistake or a waste of money. Especially my father since his favourite description of me is that I am smart enough to do anything, but too lazy to actually do it. I feel like they just wanted me to be more like my brother who is intelligent, very social, and very hard working and always picks himself back up no matter what.
To sum up, since I entered college I have been feeling like dissapearing. The last few nights I jad trouble sleeping and for the last thirty minutes I have been fantasizing about getting a good knife.
Maybe I am just too soft, too spoiled, or truly too lazy. I don't know anymore, I just want too feel like there is a point to what I am feeling, to have some kind of forseeable future of interests or something, because else what is even the point of all the time feeling like shit.

Sorry for everything and thank you if you read this far.",1

"⚠️((CW: Mentions of my experience suffering s€×ual and general abuse as a child/Parental Death))







I can't believe I drive to the wrong location for a my job interview today. The market is so tight and it's hard to get interviews in my area already when the local Walmart requires a Bachelor's degree for something like online order filling. The job would've been absolutely perfect. I have PTSD due to child abuse/major depression/social anxiety and have a lot of issues with concentration/derealization/disassociation. I'm finally on meds but everythings just so slow. I'm tired. I know my psychiatrist will up my dosage tomorrow since he believes with all my symptoms that 50mg sertraline will most definitely not be enough.






My mother died on the 12th of this month and after all the cries for help... nobody came. When I tried to reach out, help looked me dead in the face and said fuck you and walked away. My mother was an abuse victim who abused others and so much more and I had to function as her caretaker and she would give me a portion of her disability to distribute to the bills that needed to be payed plus my car insurance. Now that she's gone I have no income. We were living in my whellas old house together and I'm still here. I'm my whellas power of attorney for both finances/property and medical decision. I don't know where the paperwork is. If I had the paperwork, there may have been a possibility that I could've got the house under my name and sold it. I can't find it. I checked to see if any government agencies could provide a copy but they can't. The only way to get one is via the lawyer who set it up or to redo the papers altogether. I'm so done. So freaking done. 






What's the point? I can't be myself (LGBT+ stuff) because I can't I afford the healthcare. I'm poor as shit and will probably end up homeless. I don't have a desire to do anything but die and a shitty state mental health facility can't even help because their all packed to the nines. Innocent people are dying left and right and the people in power who can make a change don't give a shit/are in for the money and their evil desires only. I didn't ask to be born to a child molester rapist sperm donor ass shat child abusing peice of shit and a narcissistic schizophrenic bipolar entitled mother. I didn't CONSENT TO BE BORN. The fuck...










...why..?? 












Also, might be autistic/adhd but no one does adult diagnosiss in my area for free with insurance that I've been able to find. I'll have to ask my psychiatrist or therapist if they know any places... If it weren't for the poor elderly pupper I'm caring for, I'd take all of my mom's old meds then set myself on fire. Or drive off the super highway that leads to the major city near me. Or even just jump of the top of a neat by parkimg garage. So done. So ready to leave. Gotta get the dog in with my Uncle and Aunt so I can kick it. 








I haven't even been able to tell my sibling our mother had passed because they committed suicide like a week and half prior to her death (survived) and I have no clue what to do...










The hell. End me. Cancer. Seizure. ANYTHING. FUCKING HELL. make it stop. Would it be bad if I just blew of 20 bucks of delta(legal in my state) to get baked as long as I stayed home and made sure my elder doggos needs were met??...im considering. I'm gonna make some lasagna or taquitos. Thanks for reading my vent ig. ",1

I lost my mother last week. She was my only family and everything and she was also the reason I kept going, because I knew losing me would kill her. But what is the point now? Why am I here? I’m so tired. I just want to sleep, sleep and sleep. Disappear forever.

My mother always saw the good in me. I’ve been raped in my childhood and also this year and I’m starting to feel like I deserve all that. There’s something so deeply wrong with me that I deserve to feel pain and suffer, again and again. But I’m not sure how long I can keep going. 

I feel like nothing is real anymore and that is really scary. I’m not here and I’m also here and being here fucking hurts.

"I'm Living My Dream Life But I'm Suicidal

SA and suicide Trigger warning ⚠️ 


I'm 22 and I'm living in America. I don't want to put my gender so I can get a neutral perspective. So for context I grew up in a very abusive environment. I was raped, beaten, and emotionally and mentally abused as a young kid by my mom's (now ex)boyfriend, and later on I was emotionally, physically, and mentally abused by my grandmother after till my senior year of highschool when my family got her an apartment to live in so we could all move away from her. She Is still in my life, but very minimally since my mom thinks family is very important. Every since I was a kid. Maybe 6 or 10 I don't remember my dream was to be happy most days. Later on it turned into I want to be happy most days, get help by a mental health professional, have kids and make sure I raise them in a healthy way, and be financially stable. I have that life now, minus the kids since there is no way in hell I'd be able to afford them and I also don't think that I've done enough healing to be able to a healthy parent. But I've gone above and beyond what I would have ever expected. I didn't think I would live past 16, but here I am, 22 and I think the happiest I've every been. I fixed the relationship with my parents as a adult, and they even realized what they did wrong and apologized to me. MY DAD IS EVEN IN THERAPY RN, and my mom and dad have improved themselves to be more emotionally healthy. My grandma even has slowly gotten better, according to my family i am very skeptical, but i can she that she is trying to improve our relationship and make right what she did to me. I even noticed that I dont despise being around her as much as i did before. I have a amazing and supportive partner that loves me. I am in the healthiest relationship i have ever been in. I literally cry sometimes because of just have grateful, privlaged, and happy i am. But, that changed when three days ago I made the realization that I am not living for myself but for others. That's how I stayed alive for so long, I've wanted to die so much but I told myself I can't because I know how it feels to lose someone close to you by suicide. I later told myself I can't die because my future kids need to be raised, and I need to break the generational cycle that my family has created. But after this realization I feel like I'm spiraling. Suicidal thoughts keep flooding my head, I'm using my therapy skills, and they mostly work, I tell myself that these are just intrusive thoughts and try to ignore them but they are just getting louder and louder. I've completed my life's dream and now what? I have no other dreams besides the one I have. I don't know if I even want kids because because of how America is rn, and just how much of a responsibility they are. I don't really see any upsides to being a parent anyways. Most parents I ask say don't have kids it's horrible. With my realization, I realized that I've been depressed for years now. Like yea, I have PTSD and stuff, but besides that I think deep down I've still wanted to die even at my happiest moments. I remember saying and think that I'm not scared of death. If it happens it happens, and that I would choose someone else's life over mine any day. But I think that I just feel stuck where I am I can't die but I don't want to live, and the only way put is if something happens to me. I can't commit suicide. I still really don't want to die but it's not out of fear, but other people. I've also hinted at this before with my therapist that I don't really feel like I have a life's purpose, and I feel like she kinda didn't know what to do. I'm also doing amazing in therapy rn, and I'm healing a lot, and I am no longer burdened by the shakles of my trauma
 Yea i might have a flashback every now and again, but i can work through them quickly and they dont really bother me. I have the emotional intelligence and skills to get me through most is not all of my stress, but this realization has hut me in a way that i dont know how to deal with. I didn't tell my therapist about this in our last session (yesterday), because of just how entitled and guilty i feel about how i have been feeling. She had helped me through all of my trauma prossesing. She has been there every step of the way and the has told me several times how proud she is of me for how far ive come. I dont want to disappoint her. Also I'm not religious. I was raised without it and I'm not going to start now, so please don't suggest that I find God or something. I don't hate religion i just dont think its for me. How do I create the will to live? How do find purpose in life after I have already completed my life's dream? 
Thank you all so much for your help, and any suggestions you may have. ",1
"I(24m) have been so unmotivated to live my life for the past 7 years. And that feeling has began getting worse since 2 years ago, I have become so withdrawn and tired of living. I never worked and dropped out of college out of guilt for my failing grades. And no, my mom isn't pressuring me to be good at school or anything. And that made me feel guiltier than before. The fact that I pursued something that I can't achieve. The fact that I have been too selfish, and I am not doing anything, and can't do anything to repay my mom for her sacrifices. Ever since then I've been too hard on myself. I keep punishing myself for not achieving the goals I had in my life. I couldn't forgive myself for being such a failure in life. I can't find a way out, to go back to living a normal, happy life as I had back then. I forgot to mention that I was already having suicidal thoughts back in high school because of my father. I wont talk about my family problems so as to not confirm to any relatives that might come across this post and realize that I posted here, hence why Im also posting on a throwaway account, but it all stems from my father.  Anyway, for the past 2 years, I have become too reclused and dying seems to be the only answer I have. I just want it to end. To disappear and be done with it all. But Im a coward. Im just waiting for something, someone to end it all for me. Add to that the guilt of not doing anything to better myself or my life, it's making my suicidal thoughts worse. Im just here in my room, slowly rotting and wasting away. I feel powerless against this feeling, and what's worse is I brought this all to myself. I only have myself to blame for being a failure. I dont even know why I am writing this all down here. Is this a call for help? My final words in case I do end myself sooner than I anticipated? I can't tell anymore. I can't do this any further, I have wasted away so much time not doing anything meaningful in my life and I have punished myself repeatedly and now, I'm just, done. I don't want to live anymore. ",1
"Your well-being is incredibly important. Taking care of yourself is not a luxury; it's a necessity. Life can be tough, and it's okay to struggle. If you’re feeling overwhelmed, please reach out. There is always someone who cares and is willing to help. Seeking support is a sign of strength, and there is no need for a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Your life is valuable, and better days are ahead. Stay strong, stay connected, and remember you are not alone.I wish I could have said this to my sister. This is her account, and she attempted to end her life a little over a week ago. She is currently in the hospital, refusing to see or speak to anyone, and she looks ""dead"" now. If you need help, please reach out. Don’t suffer alone. I wish I could talk to her, but no one is able to break through to her, and she isn’t taking care of herself in any way right now. I wish you all a safe and healing journey. I know it’s tough, and sometimes pain can last a long time before finding freedom, but it is possible.

"How do you deal with being below average intelligence. I know I'm will never achieve anything noteworthy, im surrounded by people who just understand the world in a way I will never comprehend. Am I destined to just work minimum wage for my life, which I dont mind because I try to make a positive impact on the world even though I'm never going to ""change the world"" or cure cancer or develop some software that changes everything. I feel insignificant compared to those around me. I can barely keep up in an intellectual discussion with those around me. My biggest love is movies and TV but even then I can barely keep up a discussion about the intricacies and details of my favourites. I feel like my brain understands certain concepts but lacks the ability to analyse and dissect them and actually put my thoughts into words. Is of if I have been nerfed by a higher power or something. I spent almost 5 years to get a simple 3 year bachelor's degree in computer science, every year was a struggle. I wish I could be like my brother who's logic skills are far above me who just understand these concepts with ease while my brain just struggles to grasp simple intellectual problems I know comparison is the theif of joy and all that but I just can't help myself wondering how thing would be different if I could keep up with my peers. I can't even hold a basic conversation of something beyond base knowledge,where I need to expand on my thoughts and ideas, it's as if im an NPC following flow chart of choices and ideas then I can't even follow when it becomes too complex, and even my own opinions im too afriaid to express for fear of judgement. Am I just doomed to be a bystander in life who just can't comprehend those around me and just go with the flow of the common believes not able to express myself in the way is wish ☹️

Sorry for the rant just needed somewhere to write my thoughts and vent for a bit, I know nobody will read this but it's good to get it out. maybe I should start journaling or something hehe, much easier to type/write my thoughts and feelings than speak them out loud.

 People I appreciate always reject me or use me then thraw me.
I'm jealous of almost everyone I see outside and it's so painful.

 Been abused all my childhood by my mother who never wanted me, she was ashamed of me and hated me just because I was alive. My father couldnt protect me and lived selfishly. The outcomes of all this on my mental state are awful today.
I hate myself , I hate life , I hate God doing all this to me , I hate my family, I hate the people outside who make me feel unlovable.

"I don’t really think I’ll be here very long. I don’t have friends to really say goodbye to, my boyfriend doesn’t really believe I’ll leave and i don’t have a good relationship with my parents. If I died, I know nobody would come to my funeral, and if people did it would be friends of my family, who didn’t even know me when I lived. I don’t think anyone really knew me tbh. I guess I’m putting this out there bcuz most of my closest friends are online, but I don’t think I could bring myself to reach out to them and tell them I’m leaving forever. I guess this is just here so that if they ever find this, itlll be some closure to them? and also because I don’t want to be forgotten. I’m a bit of an artist, and I always wanted to date an artist so that I would be a memory even after I died. That didn’t happen, my bf is studying to be a game programmer, he said he would put me in a game but i dont have a lot of faith that’s true. I know many people won’t see this but if you do I hope you remember me. 

My name is Nikita, I’m 20 years old. I’ve always loved video games- I feel a strong connection to water and the stars and moon. I love animals but I could never have my own. I used to have Guinea pigs called kimchi and Oscar but they passed eventually. My dream was to move abroad and get to be in the woods with my bf in the rain. I love the rain, I live in a country full of deserts and no greenery and my home town only has jungles. I loved music, and always wanted a brown cat specifically.

"What is it called when you know you don’t actually want to die, you just need a break. A just break. And all the ways you can think to get said break result in it sounding like you just don’t want to live??

Life confuses me. I was handed a weird one and I know it’s all I get and that’s frustrating. 
Just like anyone else I had a mom who had so many of her own issues, I was invisible. And I made myself stay that way. My brothers keep my parents on their toes enough for the bulk of us.
So I was alone a lot. Which seemed to fit me fine. I could spend hours in my own head.
Turns out not only do I got trauma induced brain, it seems to also contain a little of the autism and the adhd —
Then I get into an abusive relationship at 17, get stuck with him at 23 when I got pregnant. 
I now have the most wonderful 13 year old who legit saves my life every day just by existing.

But 10 years of abuse in all the ways- finally was able to leave once I came to terms with the fact … OH SHIT, I’m gay!!

So then started my life over at 27. It’s been 10 years since that happened and how is it I’m just now kinda getting a hang of life??

I started therapy last year and it just seems like the more I get to know who I really am- the more people go away. The more I get into arguments with my gf over my needs. 
My teeth have taken all the years the worst, and are slowly decaying out of my mouth. And it’s all just… idk.

Nothing seems real. I feel like a video game character living in the twilight zone.
Each day I wake up thinking or hoping or trying to make the day mine. To be motivated and do the things and … then I cry and get overwhelmed about something and then the day gets away from me- and then you try again.
And again.
And it’s always the same.
No matter what.

So what the actual fuck is the point? To go in the merry go round of shit? To just constantly be struggling just to exist because that’s all the energy we have?
Worry about money, food, life, love, trauma, why am I the way I am…. Every day until we randomly die? We get no say or instructions.

Like am I finally going to get it together and then get cancer and die before enjoying it like my grandma did?

Am I just going to be fighting to feel some sort of “normal” like I see everyone else feeling? It’s like I’m constantly just chasing this non existent feeling of belonging. Of feeling content. Happy even. Idk. It all just seems so silly. What’s the point? Look at this world. Unless you have beautiful skin and features and then access to power and money… you’re fucked. 

Anyways, thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
I start talking like this with anyone else and they start looking at me like they need to take me for a grippy sock vaca again. 
But then no one actually talks about any of this and we all just pretend it’s just what it is and life keeps moving so stop thinking so much about it.

My youngest brother thought about suicide a few months back, and I told him a whole bunch of shit that anyone would say to stop him from doing or thinking about it, like the loss and effect it would have on our family. What a fucking hypocrite I am. I don’t know who to talk to about this, I have no friends, the closest thing to a friend I have is my youngest brother, how pathetic for a 30 year old to only have his 20 year old brother be his only friend. I keep sitting here in my room looking at my gun think it would be so easy and so quick, I cold stop being a burden and a leach to my parents and just end it. The thought keeps popping up and I feel like it’s the right choice. I feel stupid for even typing this here, I’ve seen some of the post on here and think that I have no right to post this while some people have real problems. Real attempts and self harm are going on and I’m just a fucking bum, idk if it’s attention or pity as to why I’m here. I keep telling my self I’m not here for that but idk what to do.",1
"I've never been happy with my life, Ive never been able to say that I love anything about myself. For as long as I can remember I've always hated myself so dearly. I grew up alone, excluded from the world, Ive been a loser for as long as I could remember. For most of my preteen years I was groomed and taken advantage of by people way older then me. Every relationship in my life has been transactional. Before I started highschool, I almost killed myself, After escaping a really long and toxic relationship with my groomer, I had nothing left to live for. I never once knew what it meant to really have a human connection with someone that was on the same level. 

The only times I felt like I did, it was because of a stupid dream I had or when I'd close my eyes and think of a life where I did have someone like that, a life where my parents cared about me, a life where I wouldn't hate myself. I was immensely bullied too, I thought that if I didn't like to live why live at all. So before highschool started, I made it a plan that two months after I graduate, I was going to kill myself.

I had nothing left I wanted to do, and I don't want to keep on living with the guilt of everything that was ever done to me. I wanted to be the last person to ever hurt me. If I was going to die either way, I wanted to be the one to do it.

The day is a year away, and so much has happened in my life that I don't want to die as much as I used to- but I still want to. I don't want to change, I don't want to think, I don't want to do or be anything and anywhere. I still hate myself, and I don't think that's ever going to change.",1
"i genuinely cant do this anymore, im crying my eyes out and throwing up, i wanna overdose and never wake up im so done with everything, ive been doing so terrible recently and noone knows it except for my partner who treats me like shit and ignores everytime i talk to her about my feelings. i dont wanna tell my parents about my mental state because i dont wanna worry them, i care about them so much and they are so proud of me for finally doing better. im genuinely struggling with my mental health more than i ever did and i need help, i dont know how to get better and i dont wanna be alive anymore. im exhausted and my partner isnt even making it easier for me, i wanna leave her and block her everywhere because shes the reason why i feel like this but i just cant leave her, im too attached to her. i have bpd and shes my favourite person, i dont see the world without her. i keep letting her abuse me just so she wont leave me but it only makes me feel more and more shit. i seriously cant get myself to leave her. im sorry if the whole thing doesnt make sense but i need help, im panicking and i dont know what to do anymore im close to overdosing because of my partner.",1

"I was borned in a poor town called ""Richville."" The house has holes that let in small animals, my parents yelled at each other and divorced when I was four years old. The government basically took the little money my parents had in legal fees. My father was very unstable and I had to be dragged around from house to house because he wanted company even though they hated him. I sat in trash that he horded in the car. On top of this, my family was religious and refused to directly help because my mother was a foreigner. Life got better for my mother but I always felt broken. I remember bringing a snowglobe to class and the kids broke it, it was all I had and felt like my world broke. The teachers and classmates made fun of me for being ""abnormal."" I felt like trash and still feel like trash. My vision is so messed up that I see sparks and I have scars on my body, subconsciously my mind and body wanted to die. I just feel like my body is just breaking, and that I don't have long to live anyway. I try to go to therapy and take meds but it does not work. My birth was a mistake that was due to desperate people getting together. I hate this world, I really tried but I can't stand living in this world.",1

This will be my last letter to you.  
I am deleting my presence.  
All that will remain is the music I find from diving in the interwebs and the music I post.  
Even a year later I still want to love you, however, I don't think I can anymore.  
Replaying everything in my head over and over, to where I lose sleep over it.

I don't feel the energy anymore, maybe every now and then, but thats all.

Thing is, I never accused you of anything. I was trying to have a conversation and you got defensive. Projected. Deflected. Rage quit. Ghosted.

And I still came back to love you. To learn about you.  
Maybe I'll mail the letters one day. Maybe Ill mail the box of things that reminded me of you. Maybe they'll reach you, maybe they'll get returned to sender.   
I wanted to explore more of me, and you, us.

Emotionally, physically, sexually, intellectually. 

History repeated itself for the both of us.

All I wanted was to learn from our hardships and put the history where it was supposed to be, in the past.

So I could move forward with you by my side. To watch you grow and so I can check every sticky note and throw it away.

We've both gone through some experiences. Most of mine you've heard.

I will remember for all time, even though you're gone, you're still mine. I will remember for all time, that I will always love you, all the time.  


I will always hope to go back to that time.

"I am so... so very tired. My dog, who used to be perfect, got a spinal stroke about two months ago. Now he can't walk right, his behavior changed and he doesn't pee in his designated spots anymore, and now because he can't scratch his ears, he has ear problems. At the same time this happened, my grandfather went to the hospital for hemoglobin loss, and instead of fixing the damn problem the first visit, he had to go back two more times until they finally decided to do something about it. But he and his wife should have moved into a home sooner so that my mom, my only support, could stay with me, my father and my dog. She's had to babysit my awful grandmother for two months instead of taking care of us. My dad has short-term memory loss and he's unable to understand what I'm going through because he has a goldfish brain and he can't remember anything I tell him.

I am trying to get diagnosed with autism but there isn't a single location that takes my insurance. I need a diagnosis to help me get disability. I also have fibromyalgia and have had it for two years. I asked doctors to help me with all of my medical needs, but they will not. This is the worst country. I am in pain mentally and physically, and no one will help. There's no cure for my dog's spinal stroke. There's no cure for fibro. There aren't cures for anything. My parents have problems. My grandparents are burdens who refuse to move into a home. My dog used to be my only joy in this life but now he's a burden too. I just want it all to stop. I want everything to end.

"You know I’ve been thinking. All my life I’ve been drawn to help others. I’ve always gotten immense pleasure out of making people happy and problem free. I’ve always thought we’re all the same, we’re all human, so we all must love helping and caring for each other. My god, how wrong i was! This is the planet of the douchebags. And the way they train good people to be douchebags is to attack them whenever they be good. Take advantage of every kindness, see how much they can get out of the sucker. Laugh at them and call them a pushover for wanting to help. Just wolves and sheep, either your a cruel piece of crap who takes all they can, or you’re a dumb sheep who loses out. The whole “be a good person” propaganda they keep spreading is just to get the sheep to reveal themselves so they can attack. This is a planet of predator and prey. And you think maybe humans have become intelligent and civilized and are beyond that animalistic stuff, but nooooo, humans are the worst of them all! Animals don’t know any better, their brains aren’t even capable of reason, only instinct. But humans know exactly what they’re doing and they still do it. Civilization just changed the way they be predators. Predators kill something and consume its resources, but humans advanced this process by now working their prey to death and extorting all the resources out of them threw labor. I mean look at the world, just money money money and people being forced to work to death. So for that rare person who was born a decent person by some weird genetic anomaly, you would rather die than play along with this despicable game of money. Iike wth, people enjoying enormous wealth, while other people literally starve, and everyone else is just cool with that? And then every now and then they get all moralistic about one little incident in the news and forget that the whole world is one big autraucity. Suddenly they give a damn about one little thing and then don’t give a damn the rest of the time, what a bunch of fake morality! What in the holy hell kind of people have i been born amongst ?! 

But i dont want to die, so what do i do? I guess become a douchebag at all costs! As a douchebag, I would no longer be suicidal because I would be ok when bad stuff happens to me. Like “yeah, I deserve this, hahahha.” No more being depressed and miserable at the way everything is. As a piece of garbage, I would fit in great with this world! I would love this world! Like piece of trash in a landfill, you feel at home, everyone trying to screw each other over, take their money. And when life is terrible, you’re just like “hahahaha, aw they got me, time to attack back and get them back! Rrooar!” Life is great as a douchebag! Now the problem is becoming one. Every instinct in my body is to be a kind caring person. And that is the key to suffering and misery in this world. I would rather die than become a douchebag, honestly, but idk i should at least give this douchebag thing a try. When in rome, right. Ok i can do it! Treat everyone like crap, and try and get their money! A good and strong way to be!",1

"29M autistic. Didn't even know I was autistic until last year. That makes things their own form of hard, could be the reason for all this, idk.

I have always been interested in men as well as women, but I grew up debilitatingly religious. I was raised to do two things, love God, and become a great husband to a woman. So I got married. We will be married 7 years next month.

My parents died, so I finally felt free enough to openly come out as pansexual. We were open for a bit so I could feel free, but then I got her pregnant like 4 months later. My son is pretty cool. He is almost 6 months old. Growing well.

My parents chose my career died me as well. Been with the same company for over 7 years. Not a bad job, and it pays pretty well.

My problem is all my life I was told how to life and how to love. By the time I got smart about it, I was really deep into people's dependence on me. I just want to enjoy life, but I have really been struggling to do so.

When I get really high or drunk, it helps. But if I get too drunk I get even more suicidal. You would run that with a wife that needs me and a healthy son and a well paying job, I would be happy right? 

Nothing gives me joy anymore. I just want to get high or drunk so I can tell better. My wife isn't a bad person, just not a very good partner. At this point she is more my first child than my partner. Again, she isn't a bad person, just really dependant and don't have much capacity about taking care of me if I need it, emotionally.

I don't believe that love exists. I believe that everyone that ""loves"" someone loves them for their expectations of them or their expectations of their role in their lives. This has been shown to me by my parents, my wife, that God I was supposed to believe in, and the final straw was my best friend. I got depressed and he got mad at me for not entertaining him as much as I used to when he would talk to me. Again, autistic, so when I get depressed I shut down.

My body hurts, as I have sustained a few surgeries and some injuries. It always hurts, unless I am drunk or high enough.

I know it seems like I'm bitching about being sad or something. I've seen people on here with way better reasons than me. But I'm just not happy. I'm living a life I never wanted for myself, because I only know how to give and give and give, and people don't really give back the same way I give, so I'm just running out.

I want to be able to experience my sexuality without other people limiting me. I've been with men before, so I know what it is like. But right now, my only sexual option is my wife, which our whole marriage sex has been a weird topic, or masturbation, and the later is just not doing anything anymore.

I worry about my son. What if I never get better, and my son just has a miserable dad his whole life? Doesn't he deserve a father that has his shit together without needing to be high or drunk to enjoy anything?

I'm trying to enjoy life, I really am, but I just feel completely alone. Everyone depends on me and I make everyone happy, but I have no one I can depend on and no one makes me happy. Idk.

"This past May, I tried to kill myself. I attemped to overdose and was found by two friends, then subsequently taken to the hospital. I'm an engineering student and the week of my attempt I had finals. While I was in the hospital with limited contact to the outside world, there were exams going on. Once I got out, I emailed my professors, telling them I had a medical emergency (didn't want to disclose the reason of my hospitilization), and basically begged to make up my exams. They all told me to basically reach out at the end of summer and take it when school started back up again. I tried to fix myself, started exercising, journaling, dieting, reading, less screentime, going to therapy, all that jazz. I honestly tried to speedrun it, try to make myself not depressed, so I could go back to school and pretend it was all okay again. I'm not someone that other people would think is depressed. I force myself to laugh and smile and not kill the vibe, even though I feel so incredibly hollow on the inside. I don't want people to know I'm depressed, it feels so shameful and embarrassing. So, I tried to fucking get over it in two months, I had a timeline and everything. I took my pills, I talked in therapy, etc. And I felt okay, for like a week.  I thought I was over it, that I healed, but when I went to type out an email to my professor about making up the exam since summer is drawing to a close, my hands started shaking and I began spiraling. I'm just thrusting myself back into the same stressful academic environment, same apartment I tried to end everything in, same everything, and I'm not even sure if I don't want to die. I still do, a huge part of me still does, bigger than I want to admit. I don't know what to do. I don't want to tell my friends, because they all expect me to be better, I can't tell my family, they also expect me to just be okay. Why can't I be okay? I wish there was a guide book on how to fix myself so I didn't have to have a panic attack or scratch myself when I think about going back to school, or the fact that I've failed to fix my brain. I still wish I died, I still hate existing, I don't know if it'll ever get better.",1
Not sure why im writing this. Going through a big breakup and it's hard to imagine my future. Even before the breakup I felt like my art doesn't matter or bring me joy anymore. I'm 33 with no real career or plan. The cost of living is higher and higher. When I think of the future I see nothing. I'm tried of working and still struggling. student debt and credit card debt on my tail always. And now this breakup.... I thought I was going to spend my life with this person and now I'm scrambling to find a place to live. The only thing keeping me from not killing myself is reading the horror stories here of peoples failed attempts. I would end it if I knew it was guaranteed to work. I don't know what to do,1
"When I learned about Heaven's Gate I thought the aliens were stupid but the concept was still there. A whole group of people dying at once is way more impactful than one person by themselves. 

Back then I was only 15 but I was suicidal (I still am 13 years in a row📈) and had the idea to ask others in person if they were depressed. I wanted a group of us to die at my house. I wanted my house to be jam packed with people. Even people on the grass. 

I wanted our purpose to be about fighting domestic abuse and gangs. I was tired of being afraid inside my house and outside in my neighborhood. I had no safe place. 

Unfortunately nobody wanted to admit to being depressed. ",1
"i gave him five years, and put everything into building something together, for us. i was only nineteen and i showed him so much grace. i forgave abuse and dropped out of school twice just to start over after he’d hurt me. and i now forgave the cheating, because i am a fucking clown, worthless and unable to give myself minimum respect. god forbid i ever have children. i think thats what fucks with me the most — i would have gone on to have children with him, and my children would have a terrible mommy, and i wouldn’t be able to protect them. so not only am i not contributing to the world, but am actively endangering it! and children are my purpose— i was only happy when i worked with children, and my volunteering and freelance work both include interacting with children. because children are pure and like my hair and sometimes even look up to me. 

and he ruined this for me. i lost everything. and not only did i lose it, i gave everything to him, and he destroyed it. so the “everything” doesn’t exist anymore, it isn’t even stolen or kept elsewhere, it is wasted and destroyed and burned to the ground.

and i trusted him to pick up my pieces after the affair and after i almost lost my life. why did this clown act so stupid yet again??? because there was nothing in me with any strength left to move on, so i decided to trust him one last time, because i am weak and broken. and he hurt me again. and if we ever had children, not only would they not be safe, but he would have abandoned them and me midst postpartum psychosis (which i would be prone to due to mental health stuff). and he still makes it my fault. this is too difficult for HIM. i am too broken after his affair so he should stab me in the back one last time? it isn’t enough that i almost died, that the whole academia hates me due to his rumors and manipulation, that i had to drop everything and everyone.

i lost everything because of him. my sanity, friends, education, functionality, ability to exist. im only left with nightmares every single night, and i wake up in tears, being reminded how much of a waste i am, and how awful and harmful of a mother i would have been.

i cannot do this anymore. i am twenty four and i am too broken and unwell to start over yet again. i always end up in the same dark place, and there’s no point to my disgusting existence where i continue to be the source of pain and suffering. ",1

I've lot to do tomorrow. I have to send all the goodbye letters I've written, destroy all my journals, erase all my devices and accounts… but this one will remain.

My life was nothing but a series of misunderstandings, errors, unfinished works, unconfessed loves, burned bridges &amp; wasted resources. I was a myriad of things. But not one of those things was me. My existence has always been so scattered, so fragmented, so broken… Each beam of my reflection weaker than the previous. None strong enough to be significant.

Now I face a stable point of equilibrium in my life. This state is quiet, but so deeply painful. I am simply unable to perturb my life enough for it to improve.

Everything is prepared.

This is my 4th &amp; last goodbye letter. The first 3 will be sent to my family &amp; friends. This one is addressed to all of you. Internet has always been a significant part of my life. It helped delay the inevitable many times. As such, I thank you all for all the kindness you've shown me.

I tried to be around people to make me feel better, but everyone is in a bad mood, making me feel worse. I want to escape somewhere, I want to get away from here for a little while, but unfortunately I don’t have a car to do so. So I’m stuck here. With my thoughts and no one to talk to.

When people try to meet me where I’m at I just run and I don’t stop running until I’m so deep in the darkness no one can find me anymore. Every single day of my life I genuinely consider suicide but the fear of nothingness haunts me. Some days that’s the only thing I feel. I lay in my bed staring at the ceiling listing all the ways to die, ways to cover up a suicide, places no one would find my body… sometimes I hate myself for not just doing it already instead of venting and complaining about my shitty life. When I do go out I put on a smile and convince myself I’m fine so no one questions it but underneath it all I’m fighting to make it to tomorrow and I don’t know why… I don’t know what I’m holding on for.

"I'm turning 20 on August 5th and i plan to kill myself that day. The pain is too much to live. Anti depressants, therapy, counselling nothing worked for me.

I just can't anymore and I'm just waiting for my birthday to arrive when I'll finally be free of this pain. 

Im swimming in the middle of the ocean. There was a boat with a lamp that took me up. I was saved for once. The heat from the lamp was warming. I thought that all my life has finally come to this.

Oof this is gonna be long i guess. If you make it all the way through thanks for your patience.

So i have been diagnosed with unstable personality disorder which is actually causing my depression and anxiety. I had a violent upbringing parents fighting physically , father being an alcoholic and neglectful towards my mother. Abused her , tortured her but my mom hasnt divorced my father because idk maybe during my mom's 20s or during her struggles in the marriage or before the marriage made her weak and she is also really scared about society. Funny thing is my father doesnt even contribute anything for me or my mom. My mom has a govt job and we(me and mom) moved to a big city 2 years back for my college and also for her job and my fathers direct influence in stuff lessened but not that much. I always have had a very turbulent relationship with my mother. Its abusive and toxic at worst and comolicated at best. I hate myself for the fact that she's had to provide for me till now. I am 23 years old and female. I am actively looking for jobs but the environment or situation i am in its just not letting me prepare myself for that properly. I have always been a lonely and shy kid but also stubborn and set in my own ways. According to my mother i have also spoilt her life along with my father because of my behavioral issues or my actions. She describes me as a selfish spoilt brat who doesnt have any idea about how the world works and someone who just wants to rot in bed all day and play with her phone. To be honest i do understand her frustration. I had told her years back that she is facing a burnout and she needs help but since i dont have any practical idea about how stuff works whatever i say is always ignored. How my mom and her advisors like some of her relatives treat me i feel like i am my mothers dog if i dont act a certain way i am the worst possible person on earth. My mom or her council dont understand the severity of my problems and often devalue them and try to tell me how i am inconveniencing my mother by my behavior such as anger outburst, bed rotting, not willing to be social and many more. When i realized that they will never understand the severity or extent of my problems i kind of went back in a shell i have stopped hanging out with people close to my mom for the last 9 or so months, i avoid gatherings like that because i will be asked uncomfortable questions. All i am trying to say is even though my mom or her council together have tried to do something good for me thinking about me it only ended in me suffering for their decisons and my mom also blames me for that saying we have tried to do good by you but you couldn't take it. I am always the villain in her story , she has been talking to a lot of people about my recent change in behavior like not interacting with her being in my own shell and she mentioned if anyone else had a kid like me they would have committed suicide. I have a boyfriend of 5 years and thankfully he supports me emotionally. 

The thing is recently i suffered a loss..one night i was trying to play with the baby bugie bird my mother got..i took her out of her cage tried holding her gently as i had done that once before and she stood on my palm without squirming or anything..but she slipped through and flew so high so suddenly and before i could turn off the fan..she got hit..fell down..she died..i took her to the hospital but it was too late..i believe i killed her and i deserve whatever punishment there is..but her death kind of broke something in me...i kind of cried all night and the next morning givung myself a fucking headche. But after that all the patience, all the logical thinking I had that hey just few more months then you can move out  just went out the window...I am so fucking explosive right now that even the littlest things are getting the worst reaction from me..I am saying horrendous things about my mother about the relatives (they all actually did something in December last year that caused a major breakdown in me and since that I have been distancing myself from everyone involved). I am actively wishing death upon my mother..like I would be relived if she died I would actually be relieved...all my outbursts are draining all the life force from me and making me feel shittier...I can't think logically anymore I don't know how long this is going to stay with me..I am actually scared..my mother keeps saying people do all this stuff just before falling down from their high horse and such shit...I think I'm going crazy I think every day I am staying at home I am dying inside..I used to go to a doctor but my mother didn't like him because he was very straightforward and he agreed with me with the fact that my mother doesn't have the capability of helping me or understanding my problem as she compares my problem to others and how quickly they recovered..she once refused to give me meds saying I don't need that many meds..people who had more severe issues than me got better without those meds I am not trying hard enough..you know the ironic thing is she is in the health field a nurse actually...I am not like this I don't say nasty stuff about people like this I used to be analytical and soothe myself thinking yes they had their problems they never dealt with it and that is causing their behavior..but now I have turned into this bitter hateful person who is exploding when any kind of triggering thing is happening and blaming my mother her people saying horrible things like why the fuck won't you die verbally abusing my mother..I don't know I am scared for me for everything actually I feel like death I feel so nasty so disgusting and disgusted..I just I dont know what's going on anymore..I can't sleep I can't eat I can't study I can't relax I can't..I don't want to be this hateful bitter disgusted person..but whatever my mother is doing saying that is bringing out the worst in me..I do not recognize this person she doesn't feel like me I.. dont know..and fyi I can't move out on my own right now as i don't have a job yet and my boyfriend can't house me as he's in a different state and my family doesn't approve of my relationship as I met him on an anonymous app(bottled)..so if I leave and go stay with him my absolutely crazy family will come after him , his family his job and everything..I am just stuck and I am completely fucked I'm feeling fucked. Did anyone also got so violent or completely freaked out feeling like beating people up saying you will beat people up if they try to stop you from doing something but then you snapped back into your senses? I just i dont know  ",1

"It’s pointless. It doesnt mean I dont imagine what it’s like. Fantasizing. Yet I’m grossed out by it all the while. Separation of mind and body. People do things because genetic programming. Suicide goes against that. I want to die. Everything else is false. People are living in this insensible bubble. Reproducing, going to work, school. All of this pumps the machine. Energy for the circle of life. Creating memories and moments to make life bearable. Death is the ultimate form of making it bearable. An exit. Once I discovered this and at a very young age, the means of living became unbearable. A joke. Why live if I can just take the exit. I can avoid all of it. Emotions are not real. Placeholders to explain circumstances. I just want to take the exit more than anything. I don’t want to build. I don’t want to experience. I want total abyss. 

When I see a graveyard in a movie I feel ecstatic. Ecstatic might be the wrong word. I feel hopeful. Grateful that death exists. Jealous of those already dead. Wishing, longing, yearning to be dead. To reach the ultimate goal. The only sorrow I experience is for having a life. I wish I had not been born in the first place. I feel sorry for any life to exist. To suffer. To live a life of meaningless. Fossils show a lot of what I mean. Life once existed and now forgotten. Sum total of dust. Nothing. Empty. I wish I had never come into life.

"Hi, im 18y old (F) and although i dont think somebody is ever gonna take a second to read about my stupid and pointlesss time in earth i just wanted to let it out. (english is not my first language)

I am the middle child, i have a brother (10yrs older) and a sister (2yrs younger), my parents never liked each other, my mom basically just baby trapped tf out of my dad until breaking point.

My parents often abused each other phsically, verbally and mentally, which me and my siblings witnessed and also suffered from. Me and my sister shared room w them so we often also had to witness them having sex which til today i cant be sure if was consentual or not.

My dad also always walked around the house naked, which makes it impossible for me til today to find a man attractive or engage in intimacy because i always find that disgusting image popping in my head randomly.

My mom had my brother very shortly after meeting my dad just to have him stay w her, which he did, when 10yrs later when she had me for whatever reason or however cause she said multiple times she didnt plan on it, she had my sister a year and some months after, she wanted to abort her but my dad didnt really like me that much (at 2yrs old) so he wanted a daughter.

My mother was ALWAYS absolutely obsessed and protective over my brother even when he began sellings drugs at school, at age 15, she did all she could so he'd never get caught or be punished. My dad was ALWAYS absoutely obsessed w my sister because shes always been very outgoing, playfull and feminine, unlike me.

I have always struggled w making friends, speaking w new people or expressing myself through words.

My parents always found that upsetting cause they and my siblings are extremely outgoing and loud, that alone, made me less likable.

I spent a lot of my childhood w my great grandmother which i would like to believe was way way way way better, and she was cause atleast she liked me around more than everybody else but me being shy never helped and a lot of the old ladies that she'd go to church w thought i was deaf cause i would hide behind my grandma when people spoke to me.

Also as a child i was always a bit chubby, unlike my siblings and EVERYONE at school and at home would make sure i knew that, that only made me more ashamed of myself and aware of my existence.

I didnt have friends in pre school, or until 6th grade at all, i was always the laughing stock for some reason, i was never invited to birthdays and i was the person people would laugh and say ew when i would say i liked someone.

When i was 8 (4th grade) my brother who was 18 and previously had problems w selling and consuming drugs left the house w the girl she was dating, which opened the first visible hole at home. My parents couldn't pretend to stand each other anymore. My dad left. He would go there sometimes to see me and my sister and they would argue which led to my mom attempting to kill him 2 times by strangling him in front of us.

Through all of this my mom has always liked to convince everyone she was a victim, which she still does.

She threatened to kill herself and us, multiple times, which she never did cause she loves herself too much, she also attempted to kill us one time by leaving us alone in the house w the stove on.

She always blamed me and my sister for her and my dad's downfall, and often made us lie to know where my dad was or would be so she could make the biggest scenes for everyone to see. When i was 10 my dad found a girlfriend so ofc my mom had to find someone too. As soon as that happened, she left me in the house of some friends she had, who had two sons younger than me and two grown men living in their house, which made everything so complicated cause i had my first period there, i was so shy i couldnt bring myself to eat and caught nits. Meanwhile my sister was in vacation w my dad and his gf. My first taste of real neglect.

After a while my mom wanted to move in w her boyfriend we barely knew, i was entering 6th grade and i only had one friend. He had a son who was around 5 and he was the devil in person, we were 5 people living in a house w two rooms, extrmely claustrophobic. His son would often slap mines or my sister's butt, throw a middle finger or show his dick and never get grounded for it and we couldn't complain neither.

My mom's boyfriend didnt want me or my sister to shower while him and his son were home, or have our clothes washed in the same machine as his. But again my sister would be helpful cause she was friends w his son, so a lot of times they'd go out hapilly like a family of 4 and leave me out/make fun of me. My mom also had the amazing idea to send us to our dad's house on weekends where my stepmom one time showed us a gun and threatened to kill my mom, and we slept in the couch whwere we could hear and see them have sex.

W all this going on, i reproved that year, i was 12, my dad grounded me, took me to his house, spoke to a friend and put me working on a restaurant kitchen from 9 to 15h and 19h to 23h. 

Next year everything went the same.

When i was 14, my friend, my only friend until then, attempted suicide by sliding her wrists, my mom found out cause she was going thru my messages, and that became the joke in the house, my stepfather told me to cut my wrists once cause i didnt want to spend time w them. My mom til this day says that was ""just a joke"".

In that summer my mom and her bf separated cause my mom slaped his son, and he was so mad ab it. My mom, again, said it was all mine and my sister's fault. She stopped eating, working or feeding us, i learned ho to cook, i fed her, and my sister, i had to force her to shower and shed still get up and make a scene, attempted to break a glass at my feet and make fun of me when i hyperventilated which started to happen more often arround that time.

In that school year covid started and my sister became a troubled one cause she was always speaking innapropriatly w older boys and always wanted to go out, she was always arguing w my mom, even when i was at online class, i tried to become closer to my mom so shed feel better. My sister ended up leaving for my fad's home one time cause my mom threatened to ""spank her"". I tried even harder to be there for my mom but it didnt matter cause she brang home her bf. 

I said i dint want him here cause i had to be locked in my room for them to do what they wanted. W time she started going to his house more and more and eventually left me at 15.

I asked to have a dog cause i felt very lonely, and i did. In the 3 years i lived alone she would sometimes take me shopping for stuff to eat but alway reminding me ""she didnt have money"" even when i would see her time to time w new tattoos and clothes. She didnt buy me clothes either. I always had only one pair of pants, two tshirt and a jacket. She only went shopping for clothes w me once cause my parents were ripped in between to no repair. 

How'd i eat? My grandmother would give me food at her home cause i'd go there everyday for this 3 years to take care of her and help around the house. Last year it brcame impossible for me to do that cause i had to go there before and after school and i really couldnt, that branf me a lot of stress and i had to go through scary panic attack every night without knowing what it was, i would tell my mom ab it and shed think i was making a scene and never spent a night at home w me to help. It got so bad i couldnt eat and i stopped menstruating.

I eventually went to the doctor and got anti depressants, i found a therapist that i couldnt pay but that man offered to follow me (ive been w him 2yrs) just sincerely out of pity. I am forever grateful, even though it is not regular cause i couldnt ask him for more, it was enought for me to feel like i had a responsible adult in my life, i felt a little better and i even made a friend, which i had know since 7th grade and became closer w time, her family also made me her own and invite me to their house and special holidays, i also couldnt be more thankful. I was brave enough to try and have a boyfriend. It was a complicated journey for the both of us cause we knew each other for a year but i never let him get close enough.

We started dating around 2 months ago and it was really great, we visit monuments, museums, we share books and hed feed me when he came to stay w me on the weekends. All dificulties apart, it was as good as it could be but, a month ago, my mom decided she wanted to come live here again cause she was ""mad"" at her bf for whatever tf. I thought it could never be that bad. Boy, was i wrong.

She bring her friend, her friend's boyfriend, her friends kids, my brother, his 2 kids and his wife (their both drug addicts) here. They leave their newbord and a 8yrs daughter which until now ive had 0 contact w for me to take care. My mom finds an empty fridge and instead of buying food, she bought alcohol. I have been trying to find a job for a year already and specially now but i cant. 

My mom has suggested several times for me to leave directly and indirectly, she yells at me for being asleep, yells at me for leaving her alne at the house, whines about not having money all the time, supresses my feelings and wants me to put my dog- who is 4yrs and a home dog, outside, in a vow of stairs just because.

She's doing everything in her power to break me, she speaks wickedly about me to her friends that come here, makes fun of me w them, paints me as a really shitty ""teenager"" when i have done evrything i could in my power all this year to try and become someone, everytime that happened she would say that it was all her cause if she hadnt left me alone id never become so independent. Today she tells me im a child, arrogant, i do nothing and want me OUT.

My country doesnt give jobs to pp my age, they give it to imigrants and free housing/housing projects. I have little money from little jobs i have done and she even wanted to take that from me to pay her car debt She is always sustaining debts and then wants to put things to my name to sustain more debt, which my dad also does. 

She is making my life a living hell i cant cry, sleep or exist in this house and my dog neither. I think i gave too many details already to be explaining our fights back to back but this all it is.

I cant see further, i have no one, nowhere to go or a plan. I can only see death as an anwser but im too much of a scaridy cat to even do that? what if i fail? they'll forever make fun of me or ill be seriously injured and still be alive, idk what to do, im so sorry for all thhis, i hope nobody reads its cause its embarasing but i need a light",1

"I know these types of posts can be a real eye roller. Who am I to offer you support? I can't understand anything that you've went through, the pain that you've felt, and the burden that you carry daily. What use is it that an internet stranger is offering to listen to you? 

Those thoughts are understandable and I've had them many times myself. Truly, I just want to offer a non judgemental ear and extend a hand of friendship to anyone who may need it. 

Not because I feel like I have all the answers or that I can 'save' anyone, but because I've tried to take my life multiple times and I shudder remembering just how lonely and lost I felt. No one was there to throw me a life line and I felt like the only human in the world. I don't want anyone to feel like they have no one to talk to.

"Post was removed from r/Advice and they said I should repost here. 

I don’t really know where to start, I guess I’m typing this as I’m going to visit her in hospital is a good place. 

I’ve been with my girlfriend for about 4 months and for about 2 of those she has been talking a lot about how bad her mental health is and how she wants to end her life. I’ve tried to do everything in my power to help her by taking her on trips, taking her to the doctors and just trying to prove that a happy life is possible. She is out of work and has been since we got together so I have paid and provided everything for her. She was prescribed anti-depressants which after the 1st week seemed to be helping a lot but she had a bad day and claimed that she was just faking being better. The last 2 weeks have been extremely tough and last night was the worst of it. 

She stayed round my house (I live with my parents for context) and waited until I fell asleep and then went to the bathroom to try and overdose, I woke up shortly after she left and noticed she was gone and found her but she said she had taken some pills already. I tried to call her an ambulance or to tell her mum but she wouldn’t let me, so I held and hugged her until around 4am when she managed to fall asleep. I had to be up at 6:30am for work and whilst I was at work it turned out she went to a park and took more in an attempt to end her life. 

She messaged her friend, who is out of the country, who behind her back called an ambulance (which I’m thankful for) and then my girlfriend called me and wanted me to stay on the phone until they showed up and then even when they were talking to her stay on the phone. This lasted about an hour as I was meant to be working. She was laughing and joking about it all and I was trying to be comforting but she was saying things like “why can’t I just end my life in peace.” I know she’s going through a tough time but she also knows how much this is affecting me so it felt like I was a bit of a joke to her.

The ambulance showed up and are now taking her to the hospital which I’m on my way to, I had to leave work early to go and do this which was pretty hard to do.

I guess that’s the back story, but the last month or so has really taken a toll on my mental health and I feel as if I have reached my breaking point. I constantly try to reassure her but she just shrugs it off. I try to get to the bottom of why she’s feeling the way she does and she just says “everything”then I ask for more detail and she just says “everything”. If I didn’t push her into going to the doctors, which I took the day off work to go with her, she never would have gone. Other than the anti-depressants, she refuses to get any help saying “she doesn’t need or want help, her decision is made”. Her mum isn’t really supportive of her mental health and she says she just shouts at her when she tried to talk about it, which I really find hard to believe because her mum is lovely, and the friend she called today is an on and off friend so it all falls onto me, and I have my life and career and I’m not in any way a professional and I can’t be a carer 24/7. She said that I’m her only source of happiness but I don’t feel happy myself anymore. I truly feel I have tried absolutely everything I can to help her or push her in the right way but she just doesn’t seem to get better or want to get better and she just keeps telling me that she’s going to kill herself. It’s a horrible burden to bear and I just don’t know what to do anymore. My mental health is at an all time low and I feel extremely guilty for it because hers is even worse. I just don’t know what to do.

TLDR: Girlfriend of 4 months is suicidal and trying to kill herself. Refuses to really get any help and everything falls onto me because she doesn’t have any other support. She says I’m the only source of her happiness but I’m no longer happy myself because of the stress it’s put on my mental health.",1
"As many people in this sub are, I'm tired of the idea that ""I want to die"" = there's something inherently wrong with you. As if death as a choice is never logical. But it is?? Obviously not always but sometimes it just is. I can come up with scenarios where a lot of people would agree. For example if you have a terminal illness, many people believe in your right to die. But if you're not dying already, your life apparently can't be worse than death...than nothing, which is what death would feel like, I think. The same way it felt like nothing before you were born.

I feel like my knees were kicked out from under me and I'm unable to ever get up. I can't only have my mind in the past, I need to move forward blah blah. I can't move forward if I don't know why I was shoved prone like this in the first place. How dare you think that you're entitled to watch me crawl through the rest of my life ad infinitum. I'm so tired of working towards goals I don't want. I don't have any real goals and I never really have. I just await the end and hope/dream/wish that it comes sooner rather than later. I'm in my late 20s and my family members live a long time. I just sob thinking I could have another 60 years of this. As if this hasn't been bad enough.

My mind tortures me, makes functioning nearly impossible. The arguing between the me that's 'me' and my mind ruins so many relationships, so many opportunities. My body is falling apart at the hinges and will only progress. Because I'm not visibly physically disabled, no one sees the cage I've been stuck in my entire life. My body. My brain. It's like keeping a German shepherd in a crate made for chihuahuas and I've spent every day screaming for someone to open the door. To let me out.

And I don't want to die slowly and painfully all alone. I know it's selfish but I'd like to pass with the few people I care about able to squeeze my hand. I know it would only make their healing worse. I wouldn't actually ask for them to be there, but the idea of just...insult to injury. Suffer your whole life, have your hope crushed at every opportunity, believe it could be better only to watch the most important parts of your world burn around you, and then die alone.

The only reason I haven't completed is my total belief in my own ineptitude.",1

The ecosystem is going to collapse globally, wars will start, barley anything is going to survive. I have accomplished nothing in my life, and I will never have a chance to, because the world is coming to an end. I will never get to be successful, never be able to share love with another person, never be able to feel happiness again.

I wish my family didn't love me so i could go into the woods and just sit and waste away. Why should I keep on living. We are all gonna be dead soon. Every scientists says so, so what's the point?",1

"Couple years ago I used to study in a residential school. I used to do pretty great back then. Our hostel warden organized these dinners where he invited students in groups because our school’s dinner was just bad. I thought it was pretty nice of him to organize these dinners. When it was our groups turn we went to his room, where he cooked and served all the students. When it was over most of them returned to their dorms and some stayed back in the teachers quarter. I blame my self completely for not returning to my dorm and staying in the teachers quarter. I was lying on a mattress preparing to sleep until the teacher asked if he could sleep beside me. As a 13 yr old boy I was so dumb to even let him sleep beside me. I thought he would just fall asleep but it never crossed my mind he would take advantage of me. I do not want to mention the details but yeah it traumatized me ever since. I don’t know how I’ve kept this a secret for so long. I acted as if nothing had happened that night. I had to attend his classes, see his face during briefings and what not. I also regret not sharing this to anyone cause it probably happened with other students too. Later on another kid who was braver than me confessed to other teachers and the school kicked him out. (He is still not arrested to save the school’s reputation) This has created a scar in me and I think I lost all my confidence in life. I want to do better in life but this trauma just doesn’t go away. Sometimes I feel like killing my self, because that memory just makes me feel weak and scared of everyone around me. I can’t speak with classmates properly and make new friends. It has affected me in such a way I cannot explain. I just wanna die at this point. There’s no motivation anymore to just wake up and face life.",1
"i wasnt meant for this. i wasnt born with the right mindset or the right soul or the right conditions etc. i was born with purpose so overwhelmingly involved in connection, it was the ultimate lesson to learn for this lifetime.

"I have been planning it for nearly half a year and have gotten cold feet when it was finally time. But last month I realised that I wasn’t afraid of dying, I was afraid that I would fail.

"For almost all of those 60 years, people have repeatedly told me ""it'll get better.""  They lied and lied and lied.  Now **those same fucking people** are ignoring the lies they told me, and nstead now are telling me ""hey, this late in life, you can't expect these things to get better.  That's just the way life is.""  Which is in line with the shrink who told me that some people just don't get to be happy and that's just the way it goes.

And yet somehow something's wrong with me for complaining, for not wanting this life.  Since there's no chance of things getting better, their solution is that I'm doped up to where I just don't care anymore.  And I'm supposed to think that that's reasonable.

"I'm typing all this out to explain the reasons on why I want to die. Hopefully after I'm dead someone could read this and know why. Throughout 7th-8th grade my life has really just been fucking shit. I was doing school online since from 4th-6th grade so just imagine being homeschooled for 4 years then just coming back to public school. Hell. The bullying was awful. I was the new kid who didn't know anything. I came in 2 months late so that didn't help. These are people who've been friends since 1st grade. Oh, and I was gay but closeted but my voice made it obvious. People made fun of me about everything. My voice, how dark my skin was, where my parents are from, my clothes. I mean the ego crush was wild. Then I eventually learned to just start acting like them. In every way. The bullying, racism, clothes. I started adjusting the way I talked and even walked. Just to stop the bullying. All it did was lessen it. Throughout 7th grade I had a fucking situation ship with one of my bullies so that was fun. And my mom was fucking ruining everything. My clothes and shoes were shit so I'd borrow my siblings (with permission) and she'd throw a fit. Why? No reason. She simply didn't want me to wear their stuff. No reason behind it. Whenever I did, she'd take my stuff and we'd get into massive arguments. One time she took a bunch of my clothes and shoes. I'm gonna just point out now that she is the main reason I want to kill myself right now but just keep in mind all of this is 2 years ago. By the end of 7th grade I already knew my mental health was shit, my mom was toxic, and I was depressed. But in summer school I made a best friend and buried all that shit down. As a result, I became toxic and a nasty bully throughout summer. A month before school starts I try to come out to one of my bsf friends (the guy) and he calls me a monster, and claims the devil took over my body. I said I was Bi bc I thought he'd get mad if I say I was gay. He says ""as long as you don't date a boy"". I tell him it was a joke 2 days later and he says ""thank god."" he had already told 2 people btw. Now for the rest of the summer I'm wondering if god thinks I'm a monster too for being gay. 8th grade comes and my friend becomes the toxic one. Constantly high, vaping, taking edibles. For my own sanity I try to help her. Never works out. That situationship is still going, I'm still closeted going to school with the most homophobic people I've met btw. My bsf is lying to me to get money to buy drugs, projecting insecurities, competing with me, and making my life worse. And my mom is still being her. As much as I'd like to go into detail about her, it'd take up too much space her and my time which isn't a whole lot right now. All this is happening while I'm desperately trying to improve my mental health. But the things that ruin your mental health are all around you every second of your day.  In winter break me and my mom get into a massive fight in which I bring up a bunch of trauma since I was fucking 5 (getting ran over by her bc she was arguing with my dad and what not). In which she ofc plays the victim as usual. She responds to all of this so maturely and takes my clothes, shoes, and phone. My siblings? They support her as usual. A reoccurring theme in all our fights. My mom did something really wrong but it's ok since its her and bc I did something slightly wrong. By 2nd semester I developed a fucking eating disorder to add on to all my shit. And I officially admitted I was depressed. But I bottled it all up and went to school every day. A few days before my birthday in April, my dad has a stroke and is put in the hospital. My mom stays there with him nearly everyday for the next 2 months. I continue on going to school everyday despite all my shit acting like I'm fine which is just fucking exhausting. My mom not being here as often is the only thing that made it all easier. By this time I was able to come out to my 2 friends. I passed the 8th grade. In June my dad dies. He fucking dies. The only person whose ever made me felt loved in my life fucking dies and leaves me with my mom. First thing my mom says to me after telling me he died is ""don't you go posting about this on your social media."" She's never asked me once to this day if I'm ok. She's never asked me once if I was ok throughout 7th grade. Throughout July she invites several strangers (her friends) to comfort her and forces us to greet each once with a smile on our face. We get into several fights throughout all of this. Now we're back to 3 days ago. I'm reading peacefully on my bed and my mom opens my door, looks around, takes my phone and laptop, and says to put those shoe laces in my shoes. I had just got several new shoes and clothes, finally had my phone AND laptop, and high school started in a few days. And my mom had to come and ruin it all. She's down the hall and I'm still in my room so I yell out of anger (but also so she can hear me) ""why did you have to take my devices"". She stomps back to my room says ""ok"" and takes the new shoes I got and says ""you're not getting these back or you're devices"". At that point I lose it. I fucking lose it all. I'm yelling, I'm screaming, I'm saying whatever comes to mind because I am just so done with her and everything about her. I'm done with the emotional, mental, and sometimes physical abuse. I'm calling her names, I'm cursing at her. She comes up to me and says, ""Just wait after your father's funeral (in december) just wait to see what I'll do to you"". She claims she says this bc ""When your husband dies you can't lash out"" but she has countless times since his death. All of this in less than 5 minutes. My home life was in shambles and soon my school life. The next day I'm trying to watch tv using a roku and she takes the fucking roku. So I connect the roku from downstairs to the one upstairs and she demands I take it back downstairs bc ""that's where it belongs"". My problem with this is, there is another tv downstairs my grandma uses which is always loud because she can't hear well. I can't use the tv down there bc the other one is way louder. Because that other tv is way louder, no one uses the other tv bc you can't here anything. To add on, one of the wires that the roku needs to work is on the brink of falling off. It was nearly impossible to bring it up stairs without it breaking but I did. And now I need to bring it downstairs. I try to explain all this to my mom but she literally says ""I don't care. Take it down or I'll take it. That's your punishment"". In my mind I'm thinking, punishment for what? But do I say anything? Nope. I try to bring it down. To no ones surprise, it breaks. The roku can't work now. I'm desperately trying to keep my cool and ask my mom, ""do you have another one?"" She has the fucking audacity to say ""I know you're not asking me that question"" in an angry voice. At that point I once again lose it. Bc no fucking way. And this now brings us to this morning. She demanding that I pick up a bunch of ant infested leaves after taking away my phone and laptop and being the reason I literally have nothing to do in the house. I cannot stress that enough, there is nothing else to do in the house. She wants me to sit in my room doing nothing as a ""punishment"" when I did nothing. So I refuse to do it and she loses her mind. Yelling at the top of her lungs hitting the wall. While I'm sitting there not saying a thing. She begins to take my clothes and my old shoes. 6 days before high school starts. At this point, if why I'm going to kill myself is not clear, let me make it explicitly clear. Throughout my life I am just hit with shit after shit fucking me up, even before 7th grade. Trauma after trauma, violence after violence. It's all fucking exhausting and I can't fucking take it anymore. And these problems don't come and go. They all stay and drag me down as I desperately try to walk and pull them along and I can't fucking let go of it because they cling to me every where I go trying to fucking suffocate me. It's endless battle of me fighting just to live my fucking life and to be happy and I'm so fucking done. I'm exhausted and I just can't anymore. I have no decent shoes or clothes so that's a whole other school year of bullying throughout 4 fucking different grades because of my mom. Just constant trauma because of her. My only options are to run away or just kill myself and be done with it. Running away amounts to nothing. I'm not dumb. The only thing really stopping me from wanting to kill myself is the fact that it amounts to nothing. I amount to nothing. Just another fucking lost cause because my mom decided to ruin everything. I don't get to live my fucking life because of situations I can't fucking control. My mom is threatening to send me to military school in Nigeria where it's illegal to be gay. It's a death penalty there. Honestly the only reason I'm really posting this is for myself, to sum it all up for me to read through every fucking reason. I tried thinking of at least 15 reasons to kill myself (like that one show) but only got to 10. Still not feeling the will to live. A part of me wants someone to persuade me not to die because I know there's so much more to life than all of this. Another part of me is just scared to die. But a huge part of me is just so fucking tired of it all.

I've been on meds for many years so I have alot to od on if needed, but I don't know if I have enough to end it. The only way I feel nice and can accept myself now is by letting other take control of me and let them do what they want. My partner and I are both asexual (I'm just a but more into every thing nice uhhh personal family reasons) and he even says I'm doing stuff that people in a more sex drived relationship would do. Not like I'm trying to do it with him, but he says I keep submitting myself to people with out realizing. I've sent some showy images to older people just to feel nice when they say I look good and stuff. Ive only ever had one person who would tell me to do things for them and have rules for me to do which was really nice since i felt useful. I made a promise ​with my partner that I would never try to end it again but it's to hard not to. I'm just seeing if there's anyone who would have ideas to fix myself or atleast people who would make use of me so I stay longer? I don't know if that makes sense. I know it's a bad idea to offer myself to people but it feels like it's the only thing I'm good for.",1

I just need to vent. My life sucks. I am bedridden with COVID and have all these involuntary movements and shit aside from COVID. My throat is in pain. My life is so pointless.

"After years of wanting to end it every day i finally went out and got a pistol. Picked up the highest caliber i could get to make sure its succesful and i dont end up a vegetable. Its weirdly freeing to have the ability to take your own life at any moment.

Unfortunately theres not a light at the end of the tunnel for everyone, and continuing to live is rolling the dice that one day you'll achieve happiness. Guess im just not one of those people who wants to take the chance. I wish the best of luck to everyone on their journey, no matter the route u end up taking.

"To preface this, I have no strength left at all. Keep fighting is not an option for me. I have fought long enough, from my childhood. Every day feels like fighting a losing game.  
For the first time in my life, I made a decision completely independent from my parents, but within the past few hours, it was taken from me.

I had a sure placement for a job abroad, the center of an industiry I love and would like to work in, contracts signed, quit my job, did necessary paperwork to leave my home country that has treated me with contempt for my race.

But today, my employer wrote me they found out through insurance that I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder (nothing too uncommon and would just require medication and monthly doctors' visits for some months) and they made it 90% clear they don't think I could still do the job and are letting me go.

I made a post about this today on another subreddit, because it's destroying me. Again, trying for another job is not possible. I feel empty and completely exhausted, this has been my sense of being alive since I was little.",1

"I’ve always been suicidal, and I’ve been attempting suicide since I was a kid, but as an adult my last attempt was when I was 19. For the past few years I’ve been in what my therapist calls the “grey area” I want to die, I always want to die, I wouldn’t be upset if I were hit by a car, but I’m not going to actively kill my self. And when I become more colorfully suicidal, my therapist has me remind myself I can’t kill my self till my parents die, and their assets are settled (I’m the only child and they’re in their 70s so hopefully it wont be long). Once that is done I can reevaluate if I want to kill my self still, since I wouldn’t have anyone else left depending on me. 
 But recently the “staying alive for your parents” thing isn’t quite cutting it. My mental health has already been teetering, But now After a breakup, a few revelations within myself, and a big ol rape that derailed my whole summer vacation, I don’t know If I can handle my brain anymore. I go to therapy atleast once a week since I’ve been 5, More often since my recent rape. I also see my psychiatrist every 2-6 weeks, and take my medication daily. So I’ve been trying. 
Ive made my checklist of things I need to get in order before I do kill myself. I want to leave no loose ends, and have everything paid for. I keep a running living will. I’ve recently updated all my beneficiaries and emergency contacts and all that stuff. I’ve even added certain people to have the ability to memorialize my Facebook when I do pass. And I’ve created a great organized system for all my passwords, emails, social medias, so anything can be accessed, used or changed if needed. I also intend to leave a book I am writing that will explain anything the people left in my life have questions for.
If I fully dedicate myself, It will probably take a year of getting everything settled and ready and finalized for the quickest and easiest passing, and setting up the easiest after life affairs so others don’t have to deal with it, or the mess 
It’s hard for me to fully comprehend that my life is significant. Because it’s not.  
Anything I want in life, I’ve never been able to have or accomplish. Whether that’s an education or a good relationship with healthy sex life. I don’t understand the point in life without sex, it’s genuinely like one of the few reasons I could live for, but what I want in a sex life isn’t what any one else wants.

Currently the only thing I have that brings worth to my life is my job, since nothing else has worked out in my life. But im not needed, if anything I bet my co workers wouldn’t mind a break from my annoying self.

"I'll try to be short. Sorry if there are some cringe mistakes, not the first language, etc.

My father always has been generally good person. He has been helping me to navigate the world since I was a kid. Introduced me to IT stuff, politics, religion, culture, solving life problems. So, my goal is to help him, not ""mind my own business bc it's his own life and his problems"" and wait till something fucked up happens.

During last year he started spiralling (because of really shitty political situation and war). He became irritable. Sometimes if he talks about something emotional, he cries. Recently he started to share his suicidal thoughts (when it happens he drink, obviously). He expects something like the apocalypse (due to current geopolitical situation in the world). Started talking about religious things. Started to drink every day. He also neglects his health, doesn't go to any healthcare specialists. He says that he anyway eventually will die (sometimes he even says that all of us will die, I think he means the war, but idk, I didn't ask further), that his generation time has passed (ok boomer).

At some point I told other relatives that we need to do something or it could be too late. We tried to talk to him, to stop him from drinking more, but he doesnt listen. He said that he doesn't like being sober. He doesn't want to go to any mental health professional. Although I have sent him info about volunteer psychologists (major financial problems), he always pretends he will ""look it up later"".

Recently there was some incidents when he went home drunk as hell, couldn't speak or even move normally. We thought he had a stroke or some other shit. After such adventures he doesn't remember anything (or pretends that doesn't remember).

I try to listen to his problems, to discuss his interests and latest news. To show him some positive news about science and technologies. It seems it all doesn't work, his worldview is still extremely grimdark and warped. I am really confused, because I don't know wtf should I do. I have never suffered with suicidal thoughts. I am not a therapist (I don't even finished college). I don't know how to handle extremely depressed person without professional help.  
The reason he is still alive is he needs to support his family (including me). Maybe religion. He says he listens to music to overcome dark thoughts.

TLDR: Depressed alcoholic father. Doesn't want to get professional health. Reasons: personal problems+political situation+war. Has suicidal thoughts. Neglects his health. Alcohol has already started to affect his health.

I need advice, resources, anything. How can I help? Is it possible to do something?",1
"since school started getting hard, ive been emotionally beaten by my parents. i get that im not a great student, im not very bright, ive got aspergers syndrome, my life skills are practically non existent, and im a bit lost. but everytime i try to do better, my two faced parents manage to put me down again. the amount of times ive been called an embarrassment among my peer and family is uncountable. the only couple of things ive found peace in are volleyball, working out and nicotine. im only 17 and i already wish to be gone. this isnt the first time ive been in this situation, and after therapy a couple of years ago, i learnt to adapt to my low EQ, SQ and everything that disabled me. so much good has happened this year. but my parents just managed to put out the last flame that gave me the will to live. while these reasons may seem mild to some, i struggle to put my feelings down with words. it really is difficult. when you try to show your parents how much harder youve been trying and they laugh. it hurts when its your parents. its not like i can leave yet i dont have anywhere to go. im just stuck in a hole. i hate my parents and they hate me. my constant feuds with my parents have also pushed me away from religion. i dont like it anymore. eveyrthing my parents thought me about it never happened to me. im not going to mention the religion but its a good one, it just hasnt done justice for me. since birth the religion has been channeled to my head that leaving (while faking my beliief infront of my parents) has been very difficult. its a foreign landscape in that sense. to be honest, writing this out has definetly lifted a load off of my chest. but it hasnt been enough to chnage my mind whatsoever. the one thing my parents havent taken away from me is my nicotine addiction, because they are unaware of it, and i dont plan on stopping. its the only form of euphoria that i can reach at this point. my eyes are dry writing this after the tears that flowed before it. i feel so stupid about this but i know that i dont really have a life to live for. shit parents, shit grades and all my hobbies taken from me. thats really all i can say at this point....",1

"I (25M) have been dealing with OCD my whole life, and would suffer from instrutive thoughts very regularly. Things were awful for me until recently when I was in a relationship.

She yells a lot, she isn't familiar with caring for others as she was raised in a rich family, and I have been putting up with her yelling, disatisfation over small things, over and over again.

I started therapy which I Believe is a direction in the right steps I haven’t found a solution for forgiving myself and the more I thought about it the more things from my past o remember im going to try and write everything down it makes me sad because im terrified of telling anyone these things but it all started when I was younger I watched porn with someone older then me and watched it actively for a really long time that same person also made a mistake and put my mouth around his part once which at the time I didn’t realize was bad I bite and laughed about it but now that I’m older I feel like I’ve sparked from that that is the first part of my life I felt disgust the porn addiction got worse and I actively became more horny and masturbated daily I then had one of my first sexual experiences at a really young age maybe around 11 with a girl who was around 13 I remember touching her and her touching me leading to more experiences later on I that same age remember also rubbing against people younger who I shouldn’t have and they didn’t realize what I was doing but I feel so disgusting about it I later got older and at 14 I had another sexual experience I was in a pool with someone who was a little younger then me and we both did something but later that that I pushed her into giving me a handjob I feel guilty and really bad for her as I honestly don’t think she wanted to my porn addiction had also been getting worse around this time and I started watching disturbing porn with animals I feel like I knew what I was doing was wrong and it disgusted me every time but I would always go back until one day I tried it with an animal I felt so much guilt with myself I felt like I deserved to die I did this action 5 times before fully stopping but I still watched the videos for a little while longer and at 15 I lost my virginity to my at the time girlfriend which I don’t feel shame in but I also was very unhappy after a year and she would refuse to break up with me and one day in Cuba I cheated I with encouragement from other had sex with someone who was in there late 20s I felt awful after and I even told my friend after how bad I felt and that I felt raped I then when got back I couldn’t handle the guilt I felt I told her and I begged her to not hurt herself I later did things with the 20 year old 3 more times and I feel like I’m at fault because I was the one asking for it I would flirt and look at her but every time after I would feel so disgusting with myself and felt like I just did it because I wanted to orgasm At 16 I ended up committing the worst mistake of my life which I feel like I could never forgive myself for I purposely left the door open while changing while a 13 year old was outside I felt like I should have been able to control my impulse later she laid on my lap and i believe felt my erection I then went to the bathroom masturbated and came back I didn’t touch her I didn’t do anything to her besides that but I can’t I let my body take control of me like that I can’t believe I let that happen as I was older and should have had the control to stop myself I in no way am into younger people which is why it disgusts me so bad I feel so gross and disgusting and I honestly don’t know how to get rid of this feeling and I feel like it’s eating me away through these years I also was sending nudes online and sexting people for masturbation together it makes me feel so disgusting With myself I feel horrible with myself and what has taken these suppressed memories and anchored them is a situation that happened 3 days ago where I was on Facebook and I wrote to someone for a fishing rod and they responded in messenger so I opened messenger and there was a chat from 2020 and I opened it and masturbated to the videos after the orgasm I went up and looked at the start of the messages and the girl in the video was 14 I feel so awful I feel like a monster I know I didn’t hurt anyone but I feel so bad for my girlfriend because I couldn’t control my hormones and the fact that it was someone so young has been driving me insane I know it wasn’t on purpose but I was slowly forgetting my past and in these past 3 days I’ve remembered everything and I can’t let it go I can’t burry it in me anymore I need help am i ever gonna be able to forgive myself ,1

"Something that holds me back from going for it is because I’m Christian and supposedly suicide is selfish somehow (I don’t feel like it is in my case at least, it could even be considered selfless in some ways?) Basically my point is we’re taught that you’ll go to hell if you do it and that’s an obviously terrifying idea. But I just feel like it’s not fair to suffer on earth then bc you can’t handle it partially bc of the cards you were dealt which typically isn’t in your control, and choose to cut it short you’re cursed to suffer in hell for eternity, that’s so cruel. 
I also realize no one truly knows what happens after death/suicide but in case hell is a result of that then I lean towards wanting to play it safe. It just doesn’t make sense to me though and I kinda go back and forth with what I believe to be true bc I can’t imagine and understand God being so cruel since he’s supposed to be very loving and forgiving.
This is just something I’ve thought about for years and just wanted to vent ig since I can’t talk to ppl about this stuff irl.

"Nothing helps, not therapy, not meds, nothing. I feel like I'm beyond help. This year has been horrible, I've lost so much, and I feel like I ruined my life. I have nothing left.

I want to attempt suicide but also I don't want to die, I just don't wanna be in pain anymore. I can't live like this, I can't function or do anything without being in mental anguish all the time. I feel like the only way I'll be able to get the help I need is if I attempt, and that's a coin toss between me being mildly hurt or losing my life, but it feels like I have no other options. The only other way involves me waiting 12 hours in a waiting room just to even have a mild conversation with a doctor.

The place I plan on jumping from is a pretty low fall but also it might still be lethal and that scares me. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm just faking a attempt if I do it with the intent of it being a cry for help, it feels like I'm manipulating everyone, but I don't know what the fuck else to do, I don't know how to go on, I can't keep fucking doing this.

I need help, idk from who or what but I do",1
It hurts that people would be hateful soo much to me and with all I'm going through it's too much ,1
I can't take it anymore. I have nothing and no one to live for. Drugs and alcohol are my only escape. The pain never ends. I'm trapped in a cage. Suicide is the only way out. Why does God allow this. I hope I don't wake up tonight. I'm fucking broken. I just want the pain to stop. I've been miserable for so long and it's only gotten worse. Nobody likes me. I'm a mistake and I want to die. I want to overdose.,1
ive been getting worse and worse over the course of months. last night i wanted to do it but i went to bed. i woke up today and i still feel this way. i cant fix it. i dont feel connected to anyone anymore not even my child. im numb and miserable and everything is so hard. ,1
Im struggling sm ive been figuring to find a way out. i just want to fall asleep forever. Does od work?,1
"This is going to be my last resort before I actually end it. Will medication help me not want to kill myself? 

Every day gets worse and worse. Things I never imagined could happen to me are happening. I have nothing and no one. I am alone and have no quality of life. It feels like the humane thing to do would be to end it, end the suffering. I don’t want to feel this way. I want to feel okay, I don’t want to be like this. But I do. Ending things feels like the logical next step. 

Has anyone gotten on medication and had it help?? Does this compulsion go away? Or has anyone had an experience where it didn’t help and you still feel like this? This just isn’t sustainable to feel like this every day. I need a solution one way or another. ",1
"My 14 yo waited until we went to bed last week and then took a heap of household medication. Physically ok. We are on the suicide prevention watch with public health system and she has a relationship with her psychologist for many years (grief counselling and other support as required). I am a business owner, have several committee positions but am generally home before and after school. I am considering giving up the volunteer positions to have more time available but I have asked her and she said that it isn't an issue.

"Hello, I posted here over a year ago and since that time I got my first girlfriend, this has brought highs and lows upon me, this has destroyed my mental health a couple of times but she has built it back up again and just as I think it might get better from then, it comes crashing down. I think this one is the big one, my mental health has taken another dive, partially because of overthinking that I'm experiencing and a family member has also been diagnosed with cancer but in the early stages. Mine and my girlfriend's relationship began picking up again recently, however less than an hour ago it came down, she has a habit of bringing up things that I have done in the past that I'm not proud of, I have apologised for every single one of these things to everyone involved in my actions but mostly words. She just brought something up that I did, she has brought this specific thing up multiple times (about 3 or 4) and I feel worse every single time, this is added to the lack of communication between us for a short time is mentally destroying me and once again pushing me over my limit. I do not like to say ""I'm going to kill myself"" because there is no guarantee in anything, but I have no reason to stay and it seems like a painless way out for me, no more stress, worrying, overthinking and no more panicking, just peace. Despite being nearly 18, it seems like a have nothing left to go for, I want to end my life and plan on doing it soon. Thank you for reading.",1
"21F, nihilistic, atheistic, with persistent depressive disorder. 

After failing calculus two times, I decided to take a gap semester. I haven't been peforming well as an editor in a student publication I've been in, and I've been finding myself barely functioning outside of school. My s/o has checked out of our relationship of 10 months, to which I ended up begging him to stay. We're currently long-distance for a month and I planned to go back to uni on January next year where he and I can get back to physical contact. 

We're currently in no contact for the second time. The first one lasted for 5 days, this time I asked for 7 days. He's been overstimulated by me constantly professing my love towards him, to the point of just staying with me out of pity. He said he still stayed after the first no contact because he doesn't want to see me hurt and doesn't want me hurting myself further if he leaves, and I don't want him to feel trapped.

College and life in general already destroyed me, but seeing this person walking away from me despite treating each other like best friends and a married couple is just the final blow to me. Now I need advice on how to remain alive as I don't have access to antidepressants since a month (I'm in somewhere rural). 

How can I get to continue loving myself after being so defeated? ",1
I dont see the point in living anymore. Every day is the exact same and I cant see a future for myself. I dropped therapy because it wasnt working for me. Now I feel like I have no way of getting better and I feel completely trapped. I've struggled with self-harm for a few years now and I lied and told my friends and family that I quit. I dont think I'll ever quit. I dont want to quit. I dont want to get better at all. I just want to die. ,1

"hi everyone, im a 22 year old woman and i want to die before i lose anyone in my life. i have 5 beautiful siblings, 1 wonderful mom, and 2 super duper cute cats !! 

they all mean the absolute world to me, but as time goes on — the idea of ageing is implanted into my mind. how fast time slips through my fingers and how quickly it seems to do so. and with age, comes the steady realization of death. 

these thoughts make my heart so immensely heavy. everyone is healthy. i know my family and my cats have plenty of time age-wise, but the fear of the unknow and the destined keeps me up at night. one day, i will have to lose my mom. my siblings. and my cats. 

i can’t live with the knowledge that they all may leave before me and that i will be left to mourn. that i will be left in a colorless world while my heart is taken with each passing. 

i am not depressed and i do not suffer from suicidal thoughts, but nevertheless i plan to die in a few years. after i work enough that i can leave them living comfortably and after i’ve given them amazing memories/gotten them all they wanted. 

my family [ including my cats ] are like all my vital organs existing outside of my body, they’re all i want, all i need, and all that i would die for. the love that i feel is one that i know will never be recreated no matter how many lives i live/lived. i’m grateful.

"I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 11, and since then I’ve been on and off medications and in and out of therapy. Nothing has helped me. I’ve been too comfortable with the thought of my own death my entire life and the logical part of my brain is disturbed by it, but at the same time the thoughts don’t ever leave. 

Recently they’ve been getting much worse, I can’t even drive some days because my intrusive thoughts beg me to run into a pole or another car. I don’t wanna ruin anybody else’s life so I don’t, but life is so monotonous and unfair. It’s not fun being alive. The only reason I stay alive is because my friend passed recently and seeing how ruined everybody is guilts me into not doing it. But I wouldn’t want people to be sad, I wish people understood that I just want to rest forever. Living is tiring and I just want to be at peace. ",1
"I got diagnosed with MDD, Anxiety w ocd symptoms and PTSD. I have no friends. All the friends I had were either from highschool and I moved away from my home state anyways which means I haven’t seen my family in years nor do I have the money to get on a plane to see them. I don’t have the motivation to pour into my old hobbies nor the money to get into new ones I might enjoy. I hate every job I find myself working at. I have no dream job. I’m socially awkward to a disgusting degree. I find most social situations to feel like improv. Forced to act right in the moment. I always try to feel out other people’s personality and adjust to what they’d like so I’m always exhausted and anxious and disconnected from social interactions. I’m off medication because it was messing with my body. I get high everyday because I usually desire the feeling of happiness even if it’s not authentic. I spent a lot of my free time almost in pain at how mundane life is, how cruel and disgusting it is, how I’m always so vulnerable in new relationships platonic or otherwise and people can smell it on me. Which is why I have no friends now. I had a best friend who broke the worst boundaries someone can break so there goes years of friendship down the drain. I have a boyfriend but I don’t always want him to see how much I hate being alive so I’ve stopped talking to him as much about my feelings. I feel trapped inside this life because I know that if I ended my own misery it would cause misery to the people I love, I guess I really just have my immediate family and my bf. But I can’t justify it. But I also want a release from this life. I don’t even believe in God anymore so I don’t have faith for better. I believe in luck now. And I’m not lucky and I don’t think the cards I was given set me up for a good game but I’m forced to keep playing it even though I hardly enjoy it. And I don’t even have the energy to fix my face anymore. To not look completely dead or show my anger or my sadness. Which leads to problems at work. I’ve given up on even trying to get people to like me I don’t talk to a soul. Even though I want to be liked. I feel so different. And so odd. And trapped in a life that I already know I don’t want. I wish there was a way of escape without devastating the people I love. But I rather live in misery than bring it upon them. I just wish I didn’t have to live in misery.",1
"I was punching above my weight with my ex. I fumbled the relationship and he dumped me. I’m on antidepressants and I’m still more depressed than I have ever been.

"Genuine question here. I want to die, but I know it's wrong. I know some people will never move past my death. I can't keep doing this, every day I wake up and wince, knowing that if I had just died in my sleep everything would be better. I have very little in my life, to be honest. How can I tell the people important to me that I want to kill myself, it seems impossible. My parents are constantly frustrated with my failings in life. I know they are disappointed with their son, who I've become. Why is this so difficult?",1
i have to do it because i'm hurting everyone around me and i am in so much pain i cannot physically handle living i feel like i'm being tortured in my own body and i know it's a blessing to be alive but it feels like i'm going to explode and im terrified of the end but i have to do it i just feel like i have to i can't get help and stop it i need to do it,1
"i feel so much of a failure of a person right now . i failed maths and physics and at the end of august i'm oing to have take the tests for going up to the next grade . my mom and my grandma don't want to give me free time anymore and said that next year i have to get the best grader or they'll never let me go to school ever again . my dad also says that he'll kick me out if i don't pass .

i'm currently don't have any motivation to do anything and honestly sometimes i wish i was dead , maybe , just maybe my parents won't be that mad and they'll enjoy their life more without someone who went from a straight A , always topping the class to a "" just pass "" student . and i feel that i'm just a waste of time and just some nothingness that won't change the world if gone .

"I'm 13, have access to a good school atleast compared to other ones, I don't get bullied, and my family is good. That being said, I'm bored of life. I think I might be a little sociopathic for saying this but I don't care about living for others. I don't know why I am depressed, but since I was 11 I've had atleast a lingering want to commit suicide. Now I'm killing myself on Thursday or Tuesday but Tuesday is too risky because my mom will be awake. I don't want to fail on the last leg, I'm doing this right. I hope that I no longer exist afterwards or atleast end up in a good place after the thing. 

Anyways I think it all comes down to the fact that I'm bored and don't see a great future after this. Mostly because my grandmother is a fucking asshole. She tries to be good to me but I can't live with someone who said that ""wElL I DiED"" to someone who had just lost their son to cancer. This narcissist has overstayed her fucking welcome on this planet and it doesn't help that she has overloading expectations on my ass for someone who couldn't look after her own kids to earn money.

I get made fun of for my likes and the way I dress. When I try to do things their way its always wrong, if I try to like something they like its wrong somehow.

"sorry but im gonna do a bit of a long description! if you want to read the main part, skip to the section starting with:+

im a 16 year old male. So recently, ive been on a pretty unstable ride of life. i was really bad months ago and was practically like everyone in this sub all the time for so long. id say im just a bit better now, though im feeling like i want to bring everyone happiness one day, want to burn myself alive the next. i have failed in school drastically and almost did suicide (secretly attempted and failed). but my family is rather supportive anyways and they believe in me! i even had maneged to tell my mom that im feeling suicidal a while ago.

these days ive even managed to talk to a really good doctor in the hospital secretly about how im feeling. they gave me a file to privately fill at home about my depression. plus ive found a really good game about exactly how im feeling. and while all this did make me feel better, i felt so guilty afterwards.

because while i have ambitions, i dont actually do anything. i kind of want to be a content creator with the hopes of making the internet atleast a bit better and friendly. because in my life, humanity honestly has been the only thing comforting me. the internet even with its consequences is such a wonder to me, same with humanity. so i want to make the people happier and a bit less lost in their life! id say everyone deserves feeling less desolate, and people need to learn to give their heart a break.

but despite these dreams, i havent even recorded a first video for months. im honestly wondering if my ambitions are just lies i tell myself so i dont think about how pathetic and shameful i am. i feel like i wont be much impactful and known even when i try because im an idiot. so with that im just bouncing between feeling mentally burdened but grounded to breaking down into the point i feel like im having a heart attack.

the feeling that my life is good but im still sad also made me hate myself alot. so many people would dream of conditions like this, yet im just wasting them because im pathetic and only dream and think without actually doing things yet.

+very recently, ive started self harm again. i hit my arms and legs until they feel a bit hollow and crippled. ive actually tried to bend my arm over to break its bone. i have a want to start burning myself a little aswell. anyways, after doing a bit more talk and search on self harm i actually managed to calm my brain down a little more and feel a bit more sympathy to myself. although i still have a plan of suicide in my mind, i have just a slight more love towards myself.

to feel a bit better ive gone to my mom to tell her that maybe my hate against myself isnt as reasonable as ive thought. while she was happy, ive said how some of my more private actions might further reinforce it. she questioned what those actions were, and eventually i told her how im hitting myself bluntly alot. didnt describe it any further or say anything else.

while she did tell me how thats not good... she said she will do spiritual energy treatment on me because ive gotten trauma from my ancestors, since its not normal.

when i tried to say how thats not the case, she said my ancestors had crippled limbs and how they werent satisfied with their jobs. and left it at that without and seconds doubts while i tried to say thats not it. all that struggle and anticipation of saying my habits and thats it.

im just... god i dont know what to say. i love my mom and she loves me alot, and i wouldnt be alive to day without her. but like, geez... i feel like an idiot now. was i trying to finally explain my actions just so i can get an ego boost as i still do nothing? does my mental health matter to the world anyways as ive yet to provide it anything? i feel like even this post is something i made for attention, same with this sentence. just so i can feel better as i struggle through nothing other people face.

anyways, sorry for the vent. probably gonna play games to try drawing away my thoughts. im kinda happy ive managed to atleast get out of the always bleak feelings many people have here on this sub and have a slimmer of faith, but ive yet to do something. just ideas alongside daydreams. i hope i can make people enjoy living and feel like they too are a wonder one day, otherwise im planning to eventually dunk bunch of alcohol on me and set it on fire. thank you for reading! remember to try loving yourself more, be proud you are still alive and have a nice day! \^\_\^",1

"I also talked to a psychologist on a mental health app that said he’s just specified in PTSD and couldn’t give me any advice or comfort about the situation I’m in. 

My life has been nothing but trauma.

Sexually assaulted by a man at work that I used to like. Humiliated for it by him. No one believed me.

Depressed for months. Crying for months. Endless tears. No money since I was the one laid off. 

Guess abusers always win, don’t they? 

Then as a cherry on top, my own abusive brother told me I remind him of our estranged father - I haven’t done anything to him, no. He simply “dislikes my aura.” Maybe my aura isn’t inviting towards a piece of shit that’s called me a whore and abused me my whole life. 

I’m too damaged to pursue any new healthy relationships with men. My mother relishes in the fact that “I’m” the problem. Both him and my mother seem to think so. My estranged father couldn’t give two shits about any of us. 

My neck itches from the rope. One of those sailing ropes. I actually bought it for my cat to make her a scratching post but she hated my small apartment and my abusive mother gets to have her. As well as a loving mother-son relationship and being an involved grandmother to my nephew who I’m not allowed to see because my brother hates my aura. 

They say life gets better. To just hold on. I’ve been holding on for years. This year in particular. I’ve slowly been dying on the inside and it’s like my own mother either couldn’t see it or chooses to not give a fuck. I’m almost 30 for reference - “why don’t you have your own family? You’re old enough.” Cause like I said too damaged and these men ain’t shit. Real sick of being here. It’s been a curse. When I was 2 I drowned in a bathtub but was resurrected. I believe things ought to have their way and maybe I wasn’t mean to continue to be here but I am I guess. But at this rate not for long.

" My life has crumbled since and I don’t know how to exist without being burdened by what happened to me, and being a burden for anyone to know about it all.

Since being assaulted I had to give up my job, I got a settlement and an NDA but I don't touch it. It's such dirty money. I don't want to know about it.
I was so scared if anyone knew about it they'd think the money somehow made it worth it..

It's been 2.5 years, I tried to go back to study and I failed miserably. I'm paralysed all day every day in bed. I'm so lonely, my relationship of 8 years imploded and found out since being assaulted he stopped making payments on our mortgage, he lied about paying bills, and then he ghosted me.

The more time that goes on and the less I follow a quick recovery path of what everyone else expects, the more isolating it is.

"i’m 16F and have had a hard life, including being SA'd repeatedly from 3-8. mom is adopted, and we’ve been shut out by our adoptive family. raised by my unstable and abusive adoptive aunt and bio mom who fight 24/7, and being the eldest, i have to comfort my sister whenever they do. i’ve been sheltered to the point where i’ve never been outside alone, and i never learned filipino, despite living in the philippines. as a result, i’m traumatized, developmentally stunted, lacking social skills and emotional intelligence, and my parents refuse to get me professional help.

all that aside. i’m struggling deeply after breaking up with my ex 17M, who has bpd, and whose sister 20F always supports him, regardless of his actions. during the summer, my depression worsened due to being confined at home and my parents’ constant fighting, which made me clingy and emotional with my boyfriend. this negatively impacted his mental health, leading to a breakdown and what i believe was a bpd episode known as splitting. despite understanding his reasons for wanting to end the relationship, i begged him to stay. his sister, who claimed to study psychology, intervened, invalidating my feelings and calling me selfish and weak for struggling with my mental health. my boyfriend remained silent during this confrontation.

at the end, his sister told me they ""didn’t care if i lived or died"" and that ""he didn’t want me anymore, even if i got better"". she broke up with me on his behalf, and i was blocked on everything. he didn’t even say goodbye. he left me at my worst. no, he didn’t just leave. he kicked me when he knew i was down. and he didn't even have the balls to do it himself.

so what the fuck did i do? i spiraled. i went batshit fucking crazy. i have never self-harmed before but i did it for the first time in the week after the breakup. i was starving myself, i felt fucking nauseous whenever i’d try to put anything in my mouth.

then, i got in contact with his best friend. he became my best friend because he was funny and gay and we were similar. so i started venting all my frustrations to him, about his sister, about my ex, about my ex’s female friends whom i felt jealous of. he was supportive, and he would feed my delusions like “he’s so in love with you he’s just angry and in denial.” and i knew he was lying to me but it made me feel a bit better.

long story short. my ex’s birthday was yesterday, i still loved him. i asked his best friend to send a heartfelt message from me. he received it and appreciated it, but then his best friend decided to tell him everything i had been venting to him since the breakup.

got into a fight with my ex. he was telling me things like “i got into a fight with my sister. i wanted to unblock you. i wanted to give you a second chance. i wanted us to get back together.” and shit like that. i was panicking but felt numb. i still feel numb. he cut me off again and his backstabber of a best friend blocked me.

no idea why he thinks he could just waltz back into my life after letting his sister say all that to me when he knew i was fighting just to keep myself alive everyday.

please help. i feel so fucking numb. school just started so on top of this, transitioning from a torturous household to a space full of people only worsened everything. i’m so overwhelmed. i’m so sick. i can’t eat. i don’t know who to go to. i hate everything. i hate myself. i'm highly impulsive. i'm afraid i'll do something i'll regret. please. 

he was my person. he came into my life, actually gave me hope and motivation to get better and i was getting better, and then he decided to just fuck me up all over again.

i'm so tired. please. i don't want to leave my few remaining friends behind. but i'm so tired. so so tired. please. i still love him. i love him so much and i hate it. i don't wanna love him anymore. i don't wanna hurt anymkre. i don't wanna hurt myself anymkre. i don't wanna hurt him anymore. i don't wanna hurt anybody anymore. i'm so fukcing exhausted. please help. please",1

"I don’t what to do with myself. I really don’t have plans to k1ll myself (thank god) but these thoughts and feelings have been penetrating my mind more as of lately. My whole life I was always alone. When I had friends my friends would find other friends that would suit their needs and then I’m left behind. Just when I thought I found a stable friend group that I thought liked to spend time with me I’ve just found out they’ve been hanging out at least once a week without me. I don’t ever see them unless I text them and I only ever see them at least once a month! I’m starting to believe that I’m just a waste of fresh air. What am I if not a waste of space? I think if I died nobody would notice or care. Not my parents, not my friends, not my coworkers. I feel invisible and I don’t know what to do with that feeling. I don’t know how to address it or fix it. I don’t know if it will ever be fixed. I feel like I was out here by mistake. Watch this reddit post be another piece of garbage that nobody will see. ",1
"This is a different post to most of the ones here and I hope that's okay because I'm wanting to help provide some hope.

Every one of us is hurting in some way- I'm not talking about humanity as a whole, I'm talking about us, on this subreddit. We feel the world has let us down. We were promised greatness in the future and instead we got a pile of garbage to work with while everyone around is living the dream and they look down on us like it would be better if we were dead- They may not say it, but they seem to think it.

I think the thing that causes a lot of struggle is the pressure by society to have a relationship.

It breaks my heart. Society literally acts like having a kid somehow makes you more valuable to society than someone who spent their whole life trying to be a good person and yet was given a bad hand in life.

2 things that give me hope in this regard would normally be two stories that changed my life- Doctor Who and Liar Game.

These stories have nothing to do with each other but both have inspired me in writing my own stories in that they have one rather complex thing in common- 

They both star a main character who goes through like with no romantic experiences, but they are fine with it. They go from place to place, trying to save as many people as possible and make things as best as they can be but are always faced with opposition. Almost everyone fights against them, either not caring about or not believing the existence of their moral cause. Yet despite all this opposition, they are able to overcome it and give it their all. They make some friends along the way, but they don't last. One after another, their allies leave and they are forced to confront new characters and start all over again, having to fight for their own cause with no one to vouch for them.

It is a sad existence sometimes, but also one of the most powerful.

There's a song in Back to the Future The Musical called ""For the Dreamers."" It makes me cry. The concept of the song is that we all know the famous people who changed the world- Which is why the song is dedicated to everyone who just didn't quite make it that far.

Just about every single line is pure gold. ""But for every one that gets it right, thousands more keep up the fight."" It makes me cry because it's talking about us. About me, about you, about everyone who tries to make a difference.

I don't know if my post is right for this subreddit. If it's not, I'm sorry, and I won't post anything like this here again, I promise. But if it's okay, even if it's pure cringe, I just want to have a toast for all of us. We may have not been given a fair chance. We may not be where we want to be in life. We may not know what we're supposed to do. But if we do leave this world one day and never got to do what we wanted- I want you to know that your efforts themselves will ripple out into the world and make a difference. I promise that. No matter what happens, we'll see each other on the other side and have an amazing time discussing all the things we went through together.

It'll be okay everyone. I'm here for you and I appreciate that you've been here for me.

Let's just try and make it to tomorrow. We got this.",1
"My current life isn't the worst or the best (kind of in-between) but some stuff has happened in my life before (which i will keep to myself mostly) but my most recent theories are the thoughts just randomly come to me because i'm not getting proper sleep and i'm left alone with my thoughts at night, maybe it's because i'm a furry (i have not admitted that to my parents), and most likely because personal stuff that has happened",1
"I’d say in the past when I was suicidal, it was more hysterical, like I still had a sliver of hope I just felt pain and desperation.

This time feels a lot different, it’s almost calm in a way. I still feel sad, but I don’t feel anxious, I actually don’t feel any desperation for an out or for things to change. I’ve actually come to acceptance. I no longer feel any delusion that my fate isn’t suicide. 

It’s a weird feeling, I’ve never felt like this before. It’s that feeling of I lost, and the match is over, it’s set in stone. Nothing left to do other than prepare.

The only thing is I just feel bad for what it might do to my friends and family.

I’m catching myself planning for my pets if I’m gone, putting together where I want my possessions to go, and everything. I get more excited than scared whenever I think I’m going to get into an accident or get hurt because then everything will be over.

"I’m laying in bed swallow a few sleeping pills and now that I been a family disappointment, I must let myself go tonight ",1
"I made a new account for this, but there’s a lot to unpack here so let me get into it.

I’ve been suicidal since I was probably 10 years old, around there. I’m 14 now. That probably doesn’t seem like long compared to most people, but that’s just where I actively decided I wanted to die. I don’t remember a time at all where I’ve actually wanted to live. The thing is, I am so tired already. I have a lack of meaning in life and I really wish I had a more valid reason to this other than that I’m just tired. For three days in a row now I literally woke up and then sobbed because I was alive. I’m in a lot of pain.

My father is mentally abusive and I’m so heavily behind in education that my future doesn’t look good. I’ve also been self harming for almost a year now and I’m 3 weeks clean at this moment in time. As I’m writing this, tonight was really hard and I almost relapsed. 

How do I stop this? I have a friend who knows I’m suicidal, sort of. I told her I would never actually do it, but that was a lie. I’ve been making plans a lot recently before I snapped out of it and thought to myself that I should try and find a solution. I’ve ever really only been close to my siblings and my mother. My siblings are 10+ years older than me. I’m worried they’ll put me in a mental hospital. That is my worst fear by far, because I know how traumatizing this is. I don’t believe my brother would, but it’s rare that I’m actually around him(though I could arrange it if I really needed to). I yearn to love life, but I don’t wanna burden anyone. The friend who knows I’m suicidal, I’ve been helping her through her struggles so much. And it’s not like she’s never listened to me before, but I consciously try not to because I don’t wanna burden her. I don’t know if this is the correct thing to do.

There is something in my soul absolutely begging for help, but I’m not sure how to get help. I genuinely don’t know why I should stick around. Sure it’ll make others grieve, but I’m in so much pain that I can’t care about that anymore. Does it actually get better? If my life is this horrible already I just can’t imagine what adulthood will look like. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know if I should tell anyone or keep my mouth shut but I need to do something because this is insufferable. 

This is the first time I’ve ever reached out for help genuinely, rather than just venting. I really just don’t know what to do, I don’t know how to get better because all I ever do is just distract myself, I can’t sit alone with my thoughts or else I go crazy. I used to be passively suicidal but now I genuinely want to. What would help me? What has made you not wanna kill yourself? Why are you still here? Because I can’t figure it out. I just feel like there’s nothing ahead of me.

I’m really sorry if this broke any rules, I’m really desperate.",1
"Hi all. Bit nervous posting this. Never written a reddit post at all before actually but I could just really use a place to vent. Not sure how long this will be, please don’t force yourself to read. I appreciate this space as a void no matter the response. 

I’m 26(F) and feel terribly misunderstood and unseen by every person in my life. Last year, I was diagnosed with BPD, OCD, CPTSD, and Severe Major Depressive Disorder. I tried around 7-8 different Antidepressants and Mood Stabilizers over the course of 2023, but never found a good match. I even did the DNA testing to help me narrow down options, but still didn’t seem to help. I’ve been in and out of therapy since I was a teenager (for self harm, and acting out, and some CSA that occurred when I was a child). Some of it has helped, some of it hasn’t. 

I’ve been single since I was 19, after leaving a long term physically abusive relationship. I don’t want to go into too much detail about it, but it was really bad. I have not so much as held hands with another person since then. I struggle with making friends. At one point in my life, my agoraphobia was so bad that I did not leave my house outside of work or see anyone my own age for 2 years. Some things have improved over time, but some haven’t.

I moved back in with my family recently, but they don’t want me here. I pay what they ask me to in rent, and provide fully for myself while I live here. But I struggle to work full time due to my mental health, and they see that as lazy. Despite seeing me struggle with mental health issues since I was a child, they do not take it seriously. They do not believe it. When I got my psych evaluation done, and brought home the paperwork, I told them about it and left it on the table in case they wanted to read it. They didn’t. I don’t think they’re capable of understanding, and don’t think they care enough to attempt to.

It’s not that I don’t want to move out again, but I don’t want to live alone. I don’t date, as I mentioned, and living with friends was an option before but it’s highly unlikely anything like that would last long term, so I don’t know what to do. I’m not wanted around. I argue with my parents constantly, the basis being that I’m not doing what I’m suppose to do in life. I’m not where they think I should be. I’m not who they envision me as. I feel like my self esteem, to my very core, is destroyed because of this.

I cry very often, frequently alone, and feel sadness so deep in my core that it makes my body sore. I know some people have it so much worse, and I’m sorry if any of this sounds selfish or spoiled. It’s not my intent. This is just how I perceive my life, how I perceive myself, and I am miserable.

In the times that it gets really bad, I know with certainty that I would try to commit if it wasn’t for one thing - my pets. They solely bring me comfort and they would be so sad if I was gone. I can’t bare to leave them. But when they inevitably pass, as all animals do, my reason to stay here will be gone. Part of me feels it is suffering, torturous, some sort of curse to continue on until then. Another part is trying to be grateful I even have a singular reason to stay, because I do love them very much. The companionship of my pets I am grateful for.

That’s all I really have to say. I feel like I have explained as much as I can, and gotten it all out. Not sure if it makes much sense, but I tried. Can anyone else out there my age, or anyone who has been my age before, relate to this in any way? Has anyone dealt with similar struggles?

how my mind never quieted down when i came to realization that few of my TEACHERS were the only ones to recognize my potential in some skills and were the only ones who ACKNOWLEDGED my existence.

how i’ve been outcasted by the whole class in 8th to 10th grade, nobody even wanted to be in a group with me, they would only see me as a filler if they were lacking one more member. nobody wanted to work with me, because they know I won’t benefit them anything.
 though I did HAVE some friends but they suddenly ghosted me randomly one day. two got a girlfriend and unfriended me on whatever connection we had online, and two who were pretty popular just started ignoring me one day.

I’ve been searching for any new job that’ll give me any hours at all, but nothing. I don’t have a working car, so that limits things. I’ve begged for hours, nothing. I’m treated like shit and given nothing. I wouldn’t even be in this shit situation if it weren’t for financial abuse that I suffered a year ago that drained me completely.

Tomorrow, I’m planning to go clock out on my lunch break, take a cab, buy some ammo and just finally do it. I don’t want to hear that it gets better. The last ten fucking years of my life have been a decline, and it’s only getting worse. It never does get better. That’s a lie. All I want is just to stop being in miserable pain both physical and mental.",1
"Im tired of remembering all the people who have harmed me, the people who raped and groomed me, im so tired

I just want to be pure and clean again, but its impossible, I've been forever tainted by them,

Why live if all my life is going to be is hell, I can't go back to being 2 years old, being pure and happy, just being a carefree untainted child, but I'm tainted now, I've been for years

Im ready for death and death is ready for me",1
"I feel like theres nothing left for me. Im either going to die soon or make myself go missing, but i cant keep fucking doing this. I cant. Im so tired. I just want to disappear.

"Pretty much title. I have BPD and the main thing that triggers it is interpersonal relationships. Especially intimate ones. Basically all my emotions just become very strong and every single one negative or positive hits me hard. 

I get attached easily and when I love, I love really hard. This in and of itself can be a turnoff/red flag but I also just constantly watch for signs that someone is pulling away or about to abandon me and this makes me have meltdowns a lot. 

After a lot of therapy I’ve learned not to make these meltdowns a problem for my romantic partners to fix and I have managed to keep these freak outs away from them successfully after realizing this but every aspect of my life is still just so difficult. Keeping a full time job is hard, relationships are beyond painful, even relationships with my own family can be volatile. 

I honestly feel inherently broken and like there is a piece of me missing. I use substances, food and other people to try and fill this void. But no amount of booze, food or love from others ever fills this bottomless pit inside me. 

This just makes me like a monster and a burden to the people in my life. I feel like the responsible option for me is to avoid being in relationships at all and to try and keep my human contact to a minimum to avoid hurting others. But I don’t want to live a life where I’m totally alone so then my thoughts start to revolve around the idea of maybe killing myself is the best option for me and everyone involved. My pain stops and I can’t hurt anyone else. 

I really do feel like an alien and BPD is so stigmatized that it makes me feel like a monster. I really just want what everyone else has (stable job, healthy romantic relationships, self esteem) but have an incredibly hard time achieving even one of them for an extended amount of time.

Really kind of at the end of my rope here. This is a chronic mental health condition meaning I’m going to struggle with this more than likely my whole life and I really just don’t know how I’m going to do that. I’m 26 but feel 86 cause I’m tired of being on this constant rollercoaster.",1
"I just turned 18 today and I feel so shitty. I don’t want to do this anymore. Everything just seems so stupid, so useless I don’t see the point. What’s the point of doing all this, to live a couple more years and die anyways? It’s stupid and honestly I’m angry I had to be born to do this. Im completely useless, I can’t do anything without help, I can barely walk either. Im ugly, the only good thing about me is my face, but only sometimes. I have a fucked up body, i look like the hunchback of notre dame, like I’ve literally been called that before haha. Idk I just feel stupid. I don’t think anyone could ever love me, I’ve dated a few people but they only ever seem to want my body and not me. Probably because I’m boring.. I cant make anybody happy. I just hate myself, I hate who I was born as. I don’t even know what to do anymore, because I can’t fix what’s wrong with me.",1
Once again im considering killing myself. Everyday i get more and more suicidal and it just keeps getting harder to go on these days. As the title suggests this isnt the first time ive gotten to this point but it genuinely pains me to keep on living like this. Everyday i hope i dont wake up and i think it would be for the best if i did just killed myself so never had to bother anyone again. I have such a strong feeling of guilt whenever i try to talk to people about how i feel because there isnt a reason i should feel like this but reguardless i do. Hopefully i can just fade into oblivion and nobody will remember me in a year.,1

"We are on a trip to Cali. I don't like trips but I go because my mom wants me to and to see her old friend whom I like. I am 15. On the way there I ask for food and she gets mad and says ""She just made lunch"" which is true so I shut up. However a few minutes later my brother asks the same thing and she agrees. That is annoying because she tends to be more lenient to him. 
Then when we get off the plane we go to a small bar and I try to go in for the sake of my family but I start crying and freaking out because it's too loud and crowded. My mom is reasonably frustrated and rolls her eyes at me and my dad is cursing and getting mad so I just go sit in the car and cry. My mom texts me and tries to convince me to come inside and also tell me that she did not roll her eyes. She always tries to defend herself when I am upset even if it isn't her fault. Then the rest of the entire day no one talks to me or asks me if I am okay. I am now mad because I feel like no one cares. The next day we have to go to a party. I hate parties but I have to go. I try super hard to be friendly but idk anyone there. My dad apologizes for being angry yesterday but my mom doesn't. She asks if I want to take a walk but I am too upset to move. She asks me tonight why I am so upset and she forces me to tell her and I do. She starts defending herself of course and I get upset and triggered because in the past she defended her actions for something but then later on admitted that she actually did do it. So we start yelling at each other and eventually I just get so pissed I flip her off and say she has a victim complex. We go to sleep after yelling insults at each other for hours. I wake up and I realize I overreacted and really hurt her feelings. I cannot redeem myself. I need to kill myself. I cannot believe I treated my mother so horrifically. I apologized a lot and am trying to treat her better. I need to kill myself. Everyone I have talked to has said I was in the wrong. I cant live with myself anymore. I have to kill myself.",1
"Today, at the 5th floor of our university, I stood alone and looked down. 

It was beautiful in a way, the sterile walls were reflected in a yellow dewey light from above that contrasted the black railings. 

This was the exact spot where a student of ours jumped and took her life. 

Maybe I'll follow her down. 

I feel so tired of everything. There's no point of living. My life feels like the same hell from the beginning, it's never gonna change. Every day is the same no matter what I do. 

If not for this damned phone and him, I would've jumped. I don't want to hurt him. 

And now, I'm stuck, I looked and yet I didn't feel like dying. It's so frustrating, I just want to let go. Why am I still hoping?

ive been contemplating suicide for the past decade. meds dont work. ive accepted i just go through the motions of being alive. had another driving test scheduled. spent the night in pure suicidal ideation. i decided that if i failed again, i was hanging myself. wrote a note and all. showed up hungover af, i dont usually drink. couldnt fucking care less. kept thinking if should just walk into the psych ward for good instead.  
but i passed  
everyone i know (barely no one outisde parents) was happy for me. im the only one who was disappointed. i gave myself the opportunity to fail again and quit for good but nope.  
got the licence, bought a car with money i saved up, i still want to fucking kill myself. it doesnt get better no matter what you do, fail or succeed lol.",1
"Ok, it's rare. My gf and I are living in another country due to my studies, which are close from the end. We had an argue few days before she would came here, and two days before her trip, she attempted suicide by a shot in chest, but for a miracle, she's ok after a month in a hospital. The thing is, she told me she had problems 4 days before the attempt, and she apologized for things that she was doing wrong, and she tried to explain me it was denial of her problems and she was looking for some mechanism of compensation, and I told her she should look for a man of her age who could give her dream life. She tried to explain me it wasn't about it, and I heard another people instead of my inner voice. In 4 days, she sent our photos, videos about how relationships mature over the time, and the day before the incident, she sent a photo of my medicines of boldness in a hope that I would accept her in the trip as my girlfriend again. 

  
She was in the middle of nowhere, she shot herself to the heart, but her silicone saved her life. A month in hospital, some CTI, and her lungs now are entirely perfect. She's really grateful about being alive, caring her mental health, changing her life, dreaming about many things, and she even wants to be abroad with me. She has said I had been a great help in the hospital and she couldn't imagine how partner I could I.

  
Well, I now it was her responsability, but I feel like someone who had denied to help someone from an accident in the middle of highway. I was right about breaking up, but not listen to the person who asks for help, it's unnaceptable in my life. She thought she was alone in the world. I denied to help someone more fragile. And I think there's no way to fix it. The damage was done, and no positive action can supress it, it's similar to a man who had been a good husband for 20 years, and one day, he punchs her wife in the face, even it was a mistake, everything has a limit.

  
So, I think it would be justice to die. 

  
The another themes, I've lived many good things, I traveled a lot, I had good girls, studied, had good friends from every place, so, I think I've reached many things, so, I don't have much more to live. My profesional life is stucked, I see no growth on it. It's like, I don't have much to do in this world. No anxienties or depression, my life goes normal as well.

  
In my last days, I just want to come back to my country, enjoy my lovely people, hug my pets, live some months happily with my girlfriend, make some of her dreams, like kid and marry, and then, pass away. My father died from suicide when I was a child, and I want to stay closer to him, we've not seen each other from a long time. I'm getting close to his age, and I wish I could replicate his death, but first, feel what my gf felt, 30 minutes of her lungs hit, the pain of her back, feel the bleed - she was in doubt she would shot in the second time or wait for help, but in this case, I would give the second shot in my head.

"I Sometimes literally don't go outside because i don't want others to see the way i look and i feel sorry for anyone that ever had to look at me.

I've developed bad agoraphobia from it and sometimes i wish i could be like an orb or non perceivable. Deep in my heart im someone who loves going to places, concerts ,museums but going anywhere stresses me out so bad i sometimes end up not going and when i do i look back at pictures others have taken and im ngl it makes me wanna k1ll myself instantly. I hate that my appearance will always be the thing im first judged upon. i wish i was judged by the way i love, my interests, thoughts and more.

"I M28 experienced a traumatic event a couple of years ago when I was raped by two men in a violent manner. I managed to avoid facing the reality of what happened for about a year, but eventually, everything came crashing down, and my life has been a mess since then.

I've been struggling with intimacy. The last time I was with a woman, she held my face to kiss me, and her touch triggered a flashback to that night. It felt so real that I reflexively pushed her away. I felt terrible because I was afraid I had hurt her, and I couldn't bring myself to explain what happened, so I left and ghosted her. Prior to this everything was going well and we both felt we were ready to take it to the next level. I did hurt her based on the last messages she sent me after ghosting her. I've been unable to sleep due to nightmares, and my long-standing issues with depression and anxiety have worsened.

I'm in therapy, but I haven't been able to talk to my therapist about this incident. Sadly, this isn't the first time something like this has happened. In college, I was sexually assaulted by a friend’s cousin after I had blacked out and my roommates sent me to sleep it off. Despite having an erection and finishing, which she used to justify her actions, I felt dirty and ashamed. When I shared this with my friends, they dismissed it, celebrating it as a conquest, others didn’t believe me and my therapist downplayed the incident, he said it sounded “like a normal college party hook up” and that maybe we “should not call it sexual assault” which made me feel even worse.

This recent assault was different; it was two men, and it was incredibly painful. Clearly, I did not learn my lesson. I can't seem to move past it. I feel like I let myself down for not defending myself and am consumed with guilt and shame. I contracted HSV2 from one of the men, and now I can't look at myself without feeling disgusted and worthless.

Adding to my struggles, I recently suffered two traumatic brain injuries within a short span. Despite having access to great medical care and being financially comfortable, I feel weak and undeserving of the help I receive. I see so many people struggling with very little resources and I feel guilt for having more resources available, but not making any progress. I don’t deserve it. I let three people take advantage of me in the worst way possible.

I'm in the process of buying a Glock. While I'm not afraid to die, I don't want to die yet. I had so many plans and goals, but I can't bear the pain of flashbacks, nightmares, and the symptoms of my TBIs along with depression and worsening anxiety. I also don't want to burden my family, especially my father, who I fear would be disappointed and might disown me if he found out what happened. He is a great father, but he is a bit closed minded and doesn’t believe men can be victims. I know that’s all kinds of wrong. I'm afraid no one will believe me, as was the case in college or believe me but change the narrative to fit their perspective. 

I hate myself more each day, and I don't know how to cope with this growing self-loathing.

I'm sorry if this message seems disjointed or if I've offended anyone. I support all consensual relationships between adults. 

If anyone has advice or has been through something similar, please share how you managed to cope and move forward as suicide is my best option at the moment. ",1
"I'm so tired and time feels like its slipping away from my hands like a grains of salt.

"I’m still young, 21, but I’ve been suicidal since before I even knew what that feeling meant. When I was a little kid and still believed in God, I prayed he would take my soul in my sleep. The first time I was actively suicidal was when I was ~12 (I’m estimating, I have no timeframe of my life because it’s all such a blur). There’s been times things have been a little better, but I’ve never been really happy with myself or my life. 

I really don’t think I’m built to make it in this world/society. My anxiety is so bad it stops me from doing so many things (my therapist thinks I’m neurodivergent). I have a degree but can’t even use it, I can’t attend a job interview because of panic attacks. So I work stupid little part-time jobs, because I also can’t seem to manage working full-time without burning myself out, becoming so depressed I can’t get out of bed to go to work. 

Now I’m sitting here alone. The one relationship in my life that gave me a glimmer of hope for my future isn’t going to work out. I don’t have any real friends because I don’t have the energy, and people find me weird/boring/annoying, even my own family. 

I could go on for days I think, but long story short, I don’t see a way out besides suicide at this point. I’m not planning on doing it now or even necessarily soon, I just can’t stop thinking about how I know it is how I will die someday, sooner or later. And I’ve had this exact thought since I was a teen. I legitimately can’t picture myself making it far enough to die of natural causes or whatever. I cant picture myself living in the world as it exists today. 

I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to keep going, so badly I want to just. stop everything. I don’t even necessarily want to die, I just want to have a life worth living instead of all this shit I’ve been left with. I try so hard - I’m on medication, I’m in therapy and EMDR right now, I try doing relaxing and fun things for myself, but nothing works to make me feel better. It all feels so artificial. At the end of the day, I think the logical conclusion is just that I will someday have to kill myself, it’s just about when. Right now I kinda really want to but idk. I just feel so weird. I can’t even describe it. Everything’s just wrong. 

My life has changed *so much* over the years, but my feelings haven’t. They say to hold on for things to change because you never know what your life will look like in x amount of time.. but things *have* changed, and they’ve changed a lot! But the one consistent thing had been my suicidal ideation ",1
"I've experienced a life of downs mostly clinical and persistent depression. I feel completely alone in crowded rooms even when making those around me laugh. I'm constantly leaving my body behind to daydream about awful things whether it be loved ones getting hurt or reliving past moments.

I've only had one person in my life who's known me as much as I can be known and they had to go get better somewhere else. I know there's probably better things in the future. But my life is constant suffering (perceived at least) 

I was once so good at time management, being thoughtful and selfless. Remembering responsibilities and executing them. Having hobbys and friends and a relationship. Balancing all sorts of proverbial plates atop my head. But the only one left is a 50lb. Plate and I haven't been eating or working out so it's to heavy for me to lift atm.  I don't want to bother anyone with this, I'm going crazy I think. People try to make it better but they can't. I want a hug. I want to feel loved. I want someone to fill up my chest cavity with sunshine. No one can do that though. That's not their responsibility. I've tried to make it.

It hurts to see a stranger a friend u barely know die because of suicide i cant iamgine what it feels like for those who knew them for longer.

"I’ve been depressed for 9 years since my girlfriend who cheated on my with my best friend who dad was the owner of the company I worked for and had an abortion because she didn’t want to find out who the father was. I refuse to even try to open up to someone else and date again. I’m buried in debt, I now work a highly labor intensive job in the heat, I live with my parents, I’m 35 with nothing to my name except my rusty old car from high school that sits in a barn at my grandparents house. My mom and stepdad just want me out of the house because they think I’m a loser for struggling with trying to make it through a day. I tried to shoot myself last year after an argument where my mom just wouldn’t stop standing over me and yelling at me for being a loser despite having a job and trying to be happy and paying my bills because I wasn’t working two jobs so I can get out of the house faster. Something came over me and i wasn’t in control of my body in that moment.  I just stood up walked into my room grabbed my shotgun, loaded it and sat on the back porch, put the barrel in my mouth and went to pull the trigger but something just wouldn’t let me. I grabbed the trigger fast and just didn’t give it enough pressure to go off. I couldn’t make my finger do it. I fired it in the air, threw it on the ground and went to my room that is basically a storage room with a bed and cried until I fell asleep. I slept the whole afternoon and night and was woke up and yelled at for how my suicide attempt made my mom feel. The past year I’ve just been in a daze. I go to work, chain smoke cigarettes until I’m short of breath, go to sleep watching YouTube and do it over. I got fired from a job that I took a chance on that I thought would make me happy and if it worked out I could’ve made 6 figures at and I was forbid to go back into the field I’ve worked in the past 14 years because it’s commission and made to take a construction job in the heat in the summer and cold in the winter because it’s hourly and they let you work as much overtime as you’re willing to. Today was my first day. I almost passed out because I didn’t drink enough water, then got told we’re working Saturday and Sunday so I don’t even get a day off for two straight weeks. My life has become complete hell and I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t have control over my life because I believed that bullshit from high school where you should try things you like and you’ll be successful. I tried so hard and just failed. I just feel like I’m existing to experience more misery",1

I will never be enough for anyone. I’m nobody’s favorite person. Nobody loves me the way I love them especially not her. I loved her with everything I had.

I’m tired of being misunderstood 
Confused
Lonely and alone
Why can’t I figure out how to exist
Why can’t I seem to be happy like everyone else
Why can’t I seem to keep the things I touch from crumbling apart
Why do I try to take back my power to realize that my power wasn’t impactful like I thought at all
Why do I bother when no one cares anyway

And the crazy thing is that when the sun comes up tomorrow, 
I’ll feel guilty that I ever felt this way at all
And it’ll repeat

"Male 14, I have been in love with my childhood crush who is Female 13, we have been dating for the past 3 months, recently I started hearing rumours about her calling her a sl*t and stuff, i didn't care much about it because I loved her, I even told my mom about her, I told my mom I want to marry her but my mom told me that Christians shouldn't marry non christians (that girl is a Hindu) but I didn't listen to my mom's advice, last week on of the guys created a fake account and texted me saying that girl had several ex's before me (she told me she never dated anyone before) I was shocked but I still trusted her, that guy with the fake account started telling me how she was dating a muslim guy before and they had sex several times and recorded it, i didn't believe this because in India girls usually don't have sex before marriage, plus that guy said they did it 1 year ago which means she was 12 years old back then, i didn't believe him and I somehow managed to bring myself to ask my girlfriend about this, she denied it, she said she never hugged anyone before let alone have sex, yesterday at 11.am, two boys came up to me and asked me about her, i told them yea I know her she's my girlfriend, they started laughing at me and took me aside and showed me her video, she was having sex with a 15 year old guy, she did all the dirty stuff with him, my heart was shaking I feel down and i started crying so much, I couldn't control myself, they left, they sent me another video of her eating his ass, I started crying so much, i couldn't handle anything, the girl I loved cheated on me and hid the fact that she already had sex, i texted her,  I only said ″why″ and she started telling how this was 1 year ago and past doesn't matter, that's why she didn't tell me, i thought this was all a dream, I took a knife to cut my veins i couldn't handle this, she already lost her virginity at 12 yo and I saw the video and that guy he bullied me using that video, i thought to end it all, she said sorry, i couldn't do anything, i couldn't even use emojis while texting her, I just said ″I'm not angry at you, I don't hate you″ ″jesus taught me to love, you're forgiven″ ″i don't hate you please leave me alone″ she responded that she can never forget me and wants to date me, I don't know what to do, i can never hate her, she is the only girl I loved, if I hate her Jesus will be sad at me, I'm not angry at her, but I'm unable to forget this, her past haunts me and I have been crying uncontrollably in my bathroom for hours, I'm getting scared, I just wanted to be loved by her, I don't know what to do now, someone just help me and give me some advice, I'll obey the advice please, i can't stop the suicidal thoughts I just wish I took my mom's advice earlier, please guys don't reject your parents advice please ",1

"So life hasn't been going my way lately and I've been ultra depressed. I've been slowly desensitized my self to the world unintentionally.. but while doing this I'm also unaware of things that seem to happen in my life.

I haven't been eating. I drink water and the odd coffee. It's been since the 25th since I last ate, we are the 29th. I tried eating a granola bar, I ate about half and I started throwing up. I cant keep food down. I just thought about trying again but I feel discussing for even thinking about food. The thought makes me feel sick. For context I'm usually the type of person to get like 3 helping on thanks giving, make an all you can eat buffet worth my money. I'm 215lbs on a good day but have hit about 200lbs recently.

"I've been struggling with so many problems lately. One of them being, that I am a 280-pound 16-year-old loner with a cannabis and sex addiction. I started smoking when I was 15, I guess I just don't like the idea of being sober anymore. I hate the way my body looks, I hate the way I look and the way I operate is just not me. I've considered suicide on multiple different occasions, but I could never bring myself to because of my family. I have an amazing little sister and an amazing little brother that I couldn't bare to lose. I love my siblings and my family, but it's so dysfunctional. I'm oddly different from the rest of my family, I grew up differently. I have friends in real life and online, but I don't reach out when I need help. I have a major lust problem on top of other things. Being obese and having a lust addiction is what pushes me over the edge. On May 24th of this year, I was going to take my own life with my grandfather's pistol. I thought that If I smoked enough I would be able to do it without thinking. Instead, smoking calmed me and made me change my mind that day. I can't take being this big anymore, I can't take this anymore. I have a food addiction that started when I was very young, around 6-10. I had another breakdown today. I want to kill myself, I hate what I enjoy, I love what I hate. it's a continuing cycle of delusion and I'm sick of it. I just want to live like a normal 16-year-old boy. No more hoodies in 90-degree weather. No more shirt pulling around my closest family members. No more accepting the fact that I'll kill myself someday and that'll be that. No more hogging down huge portions of food and saying, ""Oh well, I'm fat it's whatever."" No more acting all hard just to come home and cry myself to sleep. I just want to live like a normal human instead of being too lazy and unmotivated to do anything. I've tried to get therapy, I've tried to start going to a gym I didn't have money for. I have no job, I sit in my room, play games, and smoke all day. I don't feel like eating anymore, I hate the idea of food. I hate everything. All of this makes me miserable, depressed, and suicidal.  I'm only on here to get this off my chest and hopefully, someone or some people see this. Hopefully, I don't muster up the courage to off myself within the next couple of days. It feels like all I can do is just end it and it'll all go away. But I don't want to, because I'm only 16. ",1

"I currently have no one else to ask about this, so hopefully someone on this forum has some opinion/advice. I’ve never posted anything like this before and I’m rarely online, so hopefully I’m doing this correctly. So my friend that I’ve known for 8 years and we’ve been roommates for eight years recently attempted suicide. Luckily, we caught him before he could act. Unfortunately, he also moved into his own house recently and now he is taking “his dog” to his house every evening. And then he drops her off here in the morning because I’m retired and he hast to go to his office job and she would be left alone in the house all day instead of being here with the other three dogs that she grew up with. She’s eight years old.  it’s his dog because he originally picked her out and has paid for her all these years so that’s how we designate which dogs belong to which of us. But because I’m retired and have been for five years, Sophie, the dog in question, and all the other dogs are with me 24 seven because I’m always out in the yard working or hanging around.  I’ve had dogs for 40 years so it goes without saying I love dogs more than not just most people but any people! So the problem is he’s being irresponsible with her. He leaves the water in his kitchen where she’s afraid to walk on the floor to get it , she’s stuck in his living room all night while he’s doing other things in the rest of the house cause she’s afraid to leave the rug in the living room. This morning when he came to drop her off, he parked on the street and lets her out of the truck and she’s standing in the middle of the road  for like two minutes! I couldn’t do anything because I had just gotten out of the shower and I was butt naked and I couldn’t run out in the road and get her …..anyway he’s being very irresponsible about her happiness and now her safety but I’m being told by everyone I’m not allowed to say anything to upset him because of his suicide attempt.  Any thoughts or opinions would be very welcome. Thank you. ",1

"I (38m) am a survivor of suicide. I’ve never been able to get past it. My father killed my mother, and then himself when I was a just a baby. I wasn’t even 2 years old. As a result, I was raised by my grandparents (split custody between paternal and maternal). I’ve always had serious self worth issues.

Now as a married man with 3 children I find myself unable to cope in healthy ways. I’ve tried therapy and mental health institutions but nothing works. I always stumble and then there’s always money issues or something stopping me from continuing with treatment. 

At this point I don’t see the need to continue living. I’m only hurting my wife and the kids by continuing to exist. The world and my family would be better of without the broken shell of a man that shows up in their lives. Everyday my first and most intrusive thought is ending it. I don’t have a weapon and don’t have the throwaway funds to get one. I know it’s not the only way, but it’s the only sure fire way I know I won’t survive. The last thing I want is to wake up in a hospital. I want to die. I’m not fit for life and I’m tired. I’m exhausted. I’m never going to be alright. I’m tired of fighting when it’s myself I’m fighting with.  ",1

we we’re together for a year and sadly our relationship was always very rocky. i commited a regretful mistake and while i tried everything in my power to make it up to him, nothing ever worked. i was not a saint in this situation either as i did and said things i shouldn’t have. at the time i felt like i was kicked down mentally that i became angry and lashed out. i was always so fustrated of the things being asked to me about someone i had cut out from my life prior to this relationship. 

i just keep thinking that while we tried the whole friendship thing i was always viewed as the bad guy because i was the one with feelings. i knew i had some bad habits but i was working on them. i felt like i was never really given a chance to improve or actually show that i’m not the person he knew in that relationship. everyone keeps telling me it’ll get better but truthfully i know it won’t. i felt like this guy was the love of my life, my second half and i’m watching all of it fade away.

"Slowly coming to the realization that I will probably never get better. I don't have it in me to be happy. I am stuck as myself forever. I can't even imagine what a life that I would actually want to live would look like. I think it's because my depression has nothing to do with any external circumstance, it is simply my default state of being. Some people are just born wrong and I am one of those people. It almost feels like a relief to admit this to myself. Now maybe I don't have to experience all the pain and disappointment that comes with running yourself ragged trying to achieve the impossible. Instead of trying to be happy maybe now I can just focus on pain mitigation. Don't worry about me actually committing suicide or anything, I have loved ones and I need to be here for them. I'm just waiting out the clock. But I'm 26, and people in my family tend to live until a very old age. My grandma just had her 96th birthday and I visited her for it, then I got home and it hit me that if I make it to her age I have 70 years left to go. I just started sobbing, I couldn't stop.

I can't get groceries on my own and sometimes even simple things don't work like brushing teeth or get out of bed.

"I really don't think I can do this anymore. I have achieved nothing in life and have mental issues that came from nowhere, I don't even have a reason for them or any real struggle in life. I've done nothing of value in this life, and the only thing I ever clung to was that I think I'm a good person.
But I got into an argument today and said a word I shouldn't say. I don't know if it's just my OCD or a guilt complex or whatever but the whole world seems dark and I can't distract myself and I feel like I've lost the only constant of myself, the only thing that I was proud of. I really don't think I deserve to be alive anymore, because being a good person was all I had and now it's gone.
I can't take it anymore. Everything is so dark and I can't feel hope. I don't deserve anything good and I've ruined any chance I have of being a good person. It was the only thing I was proud of, and now I've lost any chance I have. I really don't know what to do, there seems to be only one way forward now because I think I've ruined any chance I have of being good.",1
I feel very suicidal from a situation that occurred yesterday. It’s a long story but this man I talked to on a dating app for a short time called me a derogatory slur out of no where only because I stopped responding to his messages for a few days. (I’m fem presenting gay male) and I’m pretty sure this individual is closeted gay or bisexual. I felt so angry and hurt in the moment I wanted to inflict the same on him so I snapped and called him a racial slur to retaliate. I know two wrongs don’t make a right and I feel bad for my actions when I could have just ignored it and blocked him. He texted me from another number after saying he’s going to ruin my life and find me and have his friends who live in my city find me too and basically threatening my life and safety and I just don’t see a way out of this. If I go to the police I will have to show that I also called someone a derogatory word after I was provoked I don’t think that’s a crime or anything but it’s embarrassing and I feel so awful about it. I have so much going for my in life and I feel like it may be ruined now and I feel helpless and want to end it all. ,1
"Hey All, 

    Im ex-services and have worked in wellbeing.

I find it incredibly difficult to reach out, due to any 'official' support place, like samaritans, therapists etc always following the same impersonal lines of questioning and generic advice or medication reccomendations.

'Do you have a plan?'

'Have you tried taking a bath'

'Sertraline high-dose'

I feel it makes it incredibly difficult.
As their duty of care, trumps actually talking like a human and just discussing things...

I dont want to be remembered as a whining, moaning mopey depressed guy, so I absolutely will not burden friends and family.

"21M. On the surface, my life is not bad. I have most things that i ask for, a good amount of friends. I fumbled a great deal of my undergraduate course because i was busy drinking and partying with my friends and got serious only in the final semesters. I am trying my best to compensate for my UG course but to no avail. I cant get a job even with 8 months of experience, been unemployed since January, and I am fed up with constantly applying everywhere. I've been through a shit ton of interviews this year already. I had a torrid phase 1.5 years ago wherein I was a dickhead and pushed many friends away and I cant let go of guilt even with therapy. I am having a shitty year even this year with some deaths and a whole lot of academic and career related stress. My parents want me to join Uni by next year. I got a very high IELTS score (8.5) and I am appearing for the GRE to compensate for an average GPA and trying my best to land another job before uni.

Simultaneously, worried about not landing a job after graduation and sending my family down a debt spiral. I dont even know what to do. I am a fucking loser, for all the good things i do, i would rather scroll endlessly on social media than try and pick up attainable life skills. Everyone has raced ahead and I seem to be stuck on autopilot unwilling to make something of myself. I try to stay strong and stay whimsical through adversity. But even then, I know one thing.

"Im a 20 year old male at the moment but when i was 18 i made a horrific mistake. At this point in time i dont have the courage to tell people the mistake i made because i am still too horrified about it even 2 years after. 
I have struggled with pretty severe OCD for about 5-6 years now. The mistake happened when i was in my room ruminating about the pretty serious problems i had been dealing with. I then had a compulsion to do something which i thought would help me completely stop worrying about this particular issue which is based around real event OCD. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel and end to this horrendous issue which i had been struggling with terribly for about 3 years at this point. I also had this image in my mind about running downstairs and giving my mum the biggest hug because my problems were over. I just saw pure happiness in the future and i could not wait any longer for that. I am not excusing my actions i am just telling you why i made this mistake. I also did not realise at the time i was doing something wrong. I was just excited about my problems ending.

It took me a while to realise what i had done but when i did, it was horrendous. Over a span of a couple of months i was constantly crying, became suicidal, started cutting myself, i tried to strangle myself to the point i couldnt breathe. I also had to leave university because i was too unwell to carry on. When i was back home i started drinking a lot to get through the evening and to help forget the mistake. I also overdosed on tablets. I remember taking handfuls at a time and thinking ""i could die if i take anymore"" and then realising i didnt care if i did. I became very sick and vomited alot as a result. 

I was somehow able to push the thoughts away for a while but in the last month or so i have thought again about what i did and i am even more disgusted than the first time. I began self-harming again, and my suicidal thoughts have become even more intense. I have practiced and know how to perfectly tie a noose and i know where im going to do it. The only issue is i cannot die right now because my grandad has been in hospital for many months and does not seem like he is going to make it, so if my mum loses her son and dad at the same time, i hate to think what that would do to her. I had to call emergency services because i felt like i couldnt stay any longer. But that was a couple of weeks ago and i still panic every time i think about what i did.
 I'm just so sorry and i will never forgive myself.

"I’m a 24M with a personality disorder and PTSD, and I’m really tired of it all. I have been carrying some weight for quite a while now, thanks to the deaths of a few of my friends, and some other matters with regards to my cousins and other extended family members. 

Around two years ago, I moved to London to pursue my masters and have struggled to hold down jobs. My first employer shut shop, I had to leave my second employer because my landlord sold his house and I had to relocate, making commute 2 hours long, just one way, and the job after that had me working 16 hour shifts for 5 days a week, for a monthly 1500 quid. I finally got another job where the advert said that I’ll be receiving 13/hour, but turns out that they lied and they pay 7 (way below the national minimum). I’ve quite the bit of financial burden at the moment (13k left in education loans and slightly over a 1000 in credit card debts). 

I’ve a loving girlfriend of over 5 years who wants to get married within a year or two, and a sister who looks up to me. 

I’m aware that there are prone who would trade their lives with mine in a heartbeat, and that my problems may seem trivial to some. But I’m can’t see myself keep living like this. I feel like a disappointment to myself and I am no longer even able to hold conversations with my loved ones. 

I know that my situation will get better if I’m able to land a job with at least minimum wage, but even KFC rejected my job application. It’s not like I’m unskilled. I’m a man of many skills, but just unemployed.

on the contrary, i am not allowed to go anywhere. when i was 14, i was losing my mind and made the impulsive and reckless decision to say what i had to to get out of school. seeing that i have not performed well in my online school, i said i know that i should go back and have apologised so much for my mistake. for two years, i was not allowed to rejoin school. i couldn’t get into the single school i was allowed to join because it’s extremely hard to get into. i begged to join another, any school. just so i could get on track. nonetheless, i have not been allowed. my mother told me that she likes me not going to school, so i just know she won’t help me. 

i am told every single time i say anything that “i chose this”. i know i messed up. i know i’m stupid. but i’m not allowed to do anything to fix it. for my age, i have less freedom than five year olds in my neighbourhood. i can’t go anywhere, i can’t ask to be taken anywhere (even if it’s 5 minutes away), i can’t get working papers or a job, i can’t go to school, i can’t get my ged, i can’t even talk about anything without being either ignored or insulted and told that no one cares, or to “shut the fuck up” or “suck a dick”. it’s insane that my brothers have moved out and despite being the only one in the house, i am still the most hated and mistreated.

My family and friends all have relatively stable lives and I feel like I'm drowning. I speak to my friends so much about my issues I just feel like a broken record at this point. 
I am so very tired of the medication game of upping dosage and changing meds. My thoughts are becoming a lot more frequent again especially when my friends have come offline and I have nothing left to distract me, even distractions only go so far.",1
"I’m a 32 year old, good looking Asian guy but no matter what I do, I can’t get someone to truly love me. I’ve had similar issues with my work career, with people telling me that I’m shit, that I’m replaceable, that I’m not worth anything, but I’ve really come back from that and succeeded in my field through sheer hard work (not talent). I’ve proven to myself and other people that I am the best, I’ve become one of the world experts in the 3D printing sub technologies. But despite these things, the self growth I’ve made, I’ve discovered I can’t be loved. I’ve worked on my romantic and career life concurrently, but the romantic side doesn’t reward hard work. Instead it values stupid things like “love at first sight” and a “spark” or whatever bullshit. And it’s fine. But it also means I’m done with life. I do not care about work. I don’t care to earn any money when it means hearing my coworkers talk about all the fun trips that they will be doing with their significant other which I never will be able to do. I don’t care about my hobbies. They are fulfilling for the few moments that I do it, but afterward I still go home to an empty house. I’m so horrifically bored being alone night after night, going to countless concerts/festivals/events alone.

I don’t want to keep living. I’ve been suicidal for a decade plus but I’ve kept going by being optimistic that things would eventually get better, that it would be worth it someday. But it won’t be. I’ve been shown over and over that I’ll just be one of those awkward men in the 40s who it never worked out for. It’s absolute HELL going through every day knowing that. I’m tired of continuing to live life just so my friends and family won’t be “shattered” if I’m gone. Well it shatters me to go through every day and see others easily get what I ask for/need. It’s just not nice to myself anymore. I accomplished what I came here to do, I’ve accomplished all the goals I set for myself as a child and a teenager. I’ve  become skilled at my hobbies (I hold assistant instructor scuba diving certifications and am a skilled woodworker and skilled spearfisherman) and have a good career and I did all these things on my own with mental struggles, as shown here. So now I’m done and I’m venting here because when I vent to people in my life they both don’t understand and try and lock me into a psychiatric facility. I’m just crying out so hard to be loved and yet I’m just like a little dog that keeps getting it’s face smashed in. I’m trying to be confident and optimistic but I’m completely out of energy to lift up the shield. I’m not getting any refill and I’m so tired. I can’t drive for more than 20 minutes because I’m so mentally exhausted. Every day and night I hope to die. If anyone has a connection to a gang that needs target practice, let me know.",1

"I feel like an alien when compared to the rest of my family. I’m being pressured to get a girlfriend when I’m not thinking of getting one myself. I’ve blown up at my older sister and my dad in the past about this issue years ago, and they continue to pressure me to get a girlfriend. The women I’ve fancied tend to have boyfriends or husbands. Even on the off chance a woman is single, she provides me bullshit reasons to avoid me. I’m fine with being alone because I have been alone my whole life, and I have focused on my career. No one I know personally understands me, which makes me so sad. My family say I’m a people pleaser. I can’t win with them. I want to bawl my eyes out. I’m so alone. I’m so fucking tired of this world. I know I’ve posted a lot of posts about my sisters, but I doubt I was a blip on their radar because they don’t care about me.

I keep thinking about killing myself, I know that some people love me just don’t know how to get through this. People keep saying you’re gonna be OK but it doesn’t feel like I’m gonna be OK.. this is also my first serious relationship and we live This is also my first serious relationship and we lived together for a year.

"Using a throwaway account for privacy.
Basically as the title implies, there's no one I can think of who actually needs me or is better because I'm in their life. Sure, I do shit to help others, but I don't think the good I put out makes up for the awful experience of having to be around me. I could be easily replaced and everyone would probably be better off with anyone but me in their life. I'm quick to lose my temper and it shows, I'm a mess of a person physically and mentally, and as much as I try to be a decent person, my nature always kicks in and I snap and spoil it all. Then almost always immediately after, I realize what I've done, but I can't take it back or undo it. I hate feeling this way, because I don't even deserve to feel sorry for myself. It's the people who have to be around me that I'm sorry for. I'm so mind numbingly lonely and sad, and I don't even have anyone to talk to about it, so here I am. I don't even know why I'm bothering, I just need to get it out to someone/something. If you took the time to read this, I can't thank you enough. I'm surrounded by people right now, but I feel so, so lonely and I just want somebody to hear me.",1
"Hi there, I'm in a safe place right now.  

This is mostly so I can know what to answer when asked if I've ever attempted suicide. I did do a search though the subreddit, but hadn't found a thread that *quite* matched up with my question specifically.  

In my worst days, I would sit with my intended method in front of me and really, truly consider going through with it. I'd try to convince myself to do it. I knew what I would do and had the means, and had it within arm's reach. I sat there with the intent and goal of following through, but did not end up doing anything (except sh).  

Could this situation be considered an attempt, for the purpose of providing a doctor my history?   

Any input is appreciated, thanks!  

I apologize if this isn't appropriate.",1

"i thought life was going good for me recently, i have a job opportunity that will help me get my dream job, i’m closer than ever to being a real genuine relationship with someone i really like, and i’ve been able to spend a lot of time with my friends. 

my problem is my mom. all she does is put me down. if she gives me a compliment it’s always either back handed or she follows it up with an insult, she talks shit about me with my 7 year old sister and i worry that it’ll make her hate me when she grows up, she hates my dog because he’s a puppy and acts like one because her dog is a “perfect little angel”, she constantly says i’m disrespectful and a “pathological liar” but when i tell the truth about anything she threatens to take my car or cancel my phone plan. 

the only reason i still live at home is because she bought me the dog she hates so i wouldn’t go away to college. i don’t think i can deal with it anymore. i can’t afford to move out because i make minimum wage and i see the lives all my peers are living and i’m still living how they lived at 16 when i’m nearly 20. i don’t know how to make it stop besides killing myself. nothing i do is ever good enough ",1

I tried therapy but it’s too expensive, I have meds but I still want to die every once in a while.

"I've (30m) been suicidal since I was 10 years old. I have no idea how I've made it this long without doing it. I'm so tired now. I know my life could be improved, but the people who have the means to help me refuse, and those who actually say they want to help me don't have the means to do so. Every second of every day I feel the weight of the entire universe putting pressure on me to stop existing. I hate living like this, out of spite for the world that's constantly telling me to die. I'm barely surviving, a depressed husk of a person, rotting in someone else's house all day every day.

I hear people say all the time that humans are social, that everyone needs companionship and community. That isn't me. I'm so tired of hearing human voices, of seeing people outside my windows, of structuring my entire life around other people. I crave the solitude I used to have when I lived alone in college. Having even just one person in my life is too much for me, but I have absolutely nothing to my name. I can't live on my own. I'm completely dependent on that person to survive, and as a consequence I feel like I've ruined his life. He's stuck taking care of me and I can't even be happy about it. The best thing for both of us would be if I just disappeared, or never existed at all.

I don’t want a future sometimes and I might just want to not keep going. Don’t want to know the next step just want to leave it off. Im too scared to talk about this to anyone.

I don't feel wanted anywhere. I've had an extremely shitty day and it's just getting worse. I'm not wanted in my home or at work (those r the only two places I frequent when I'm home).

"I'm tired of this, tired of being mad and then content, mad at everything I do and happened the stuff I missed.

I feel like I'm mentally 11 the last time covid happen when I had friends and shit. Now I talk to no one because I'm discouraged to and my low self esteem 

I feel like I'm gonna be one of those couch, gaming losers when I grow up. I have no passion in education or anything, can't even find a hobby since I'm inside all day. My dad is always trying to hold my hand because he wants to be in everything I do and it's fucking lame. Ever since my dad had a stroke and he thankfully survived he has been trying to be in everything I do since ehe has nothing to do therefore I also have nothing to do.

He is a schizophrenic and hears voices that I will get hurt when I am alone without him but wtf how would he protect me if he can't move his hand!. It's retarded, I'm inside my head all day, my sense of reality is fucking distorted none of this is my fault. I'm a loser who stays inside and smokes weed and plays video games which I don't enjoy anymore. My parents encourage me to smoke weed and drink beer and shit I don't even like hat shit to be honest I just wanna live a normal social life and shit and have friends.

"I grew up always feeling like I’m The problem. Even being surrounded by family and friends I’ve always felt it would be better if I wasn’t there.

Right after highschool I unintentionally did something horrible and once the law stepped in my parents finally realized I needed them. I feel like that’s the worse part. I wanted to just kill myself but I couldn’t put the pain on them. Everyone but the law seemed to excuse what I did.

Five years later and I still want to kill myself. I’m currently in a rehabilitation program and going through the process of “healing”. They’ve helped me realize what I did and what caused me to do it. How to cope with emotions and how to not do anything like it again. All my friends like me. My friends like me. My coworkers like me. Everything in my life “seems well” “seems normal” but it’s not. Not inside. I don’t like me. I don’t like my self for what I did. I wish I could go back and change things but I can’t. I feel like I’m being eating from the inside out for what I did. No one reminds me but me. 

There will be times where I don’t think about it. But then all the guilt and shame comes back like cancer. I’ll try to hate the world but deep down I only hate myself. I just want to end it. ",1
"idk how to explain it, i keep fantasising about it, and i want to do it so badly, but i dont want to die. i dont want to leave my bunnies alone. but this overwhelming need to die keeps taking over my brain and i cant think about anything else

"Im tired. Im always tired. Constant fatigue both from medical issues and mental issues. Im nineteen and I have health issues that make me fat in a way I cant fix or control. Like actually fat. Not just slightly chubby and insecure fat. It's not fair. I was only skinny when I was too young to remember. I was treated as a mini adult because nobody could think of my fat ugly body as young or fragile or worthy being doted over. 

Im autistic and I've always been sorta lame and slow in the head. My parents' divorce in my teens was a relief compared to their marriage and neither of them love me in a way that matters. I have DID and CPTSD, severe, severe depression and I suspect maybe avoidant personality disorder. 
 I can't remember a time where I was treated like a person. I can't remember the last time I felt like anyones anything. 
I don't leave my house or my room (which is a horrible wreck) except for therapy once every two weeks.My therapist is the only person who understands who I am and what I need, and she says I need more intense care and we agreed on inpatient. 
I cant stand where I live. I'm big on conservation and biology/zoology. Insects are one of my life long interests. Everywhere I go just feels like concrete on top of concrete to me, and maybe I sound stupid but it makes me crazy. I can't stand any more parking lots or short lawns that are practically the same thing. 
I've been trying so hard to find somewhere to be in inpatient that wont just make me feel worse, or make me feel like i've gone from a concrete box to a white tile box, just to go back to the concrete box all over again. 

I only have two friends. One can coax me to hang out sometimes (god bless them and their patience) but usually I only interact with people through video games. 

I feel disgusting and pathetic. A ""good"" day for me is one where I brush my teeth, shower, take my meds and eat all in one day. And those are rare. 
I don't HAVE a situation to escape from or to run from. I AM the situation. I am miserable even when it's just me, and my blankets and a bed. I just want a mom. I just want to be able to afford one of those nice inpatient places in the middle of some mountains where I can feel like everything around me isn't dead and i'm not dead but I cant afford it. I'm very particular and ""fragile"", I guess. There is a very fine line between things that help me and things that hurt me and I cant afford the delicate things that will take enough care to not hurt me and make things worse. Im odd and peculiar, and currently i'm like a odd and peculiar difficult-to-care-for house plant who's being stuck into a crack in some concrete and left alone. 
I feel like a fish who's already been gutted and filleted, but i'm expected to just swim away and feel lucky to have been thrown back at all. 
I can't do this, I can't live, I cant understand the world around me or fill any niche inside of it. I am nineteen and I cant handle jobs I am not loveable enough to be picked up and gently fixed and beared with. 
I constantly dream of taking some blankets and stuff deep into the woods, (I dont want to make anyone in my house see my dead body) writing everyone I know a note, calling the police just to let them know where my body will be, and then curling up on the ground and shooting myself from under the comfort of my bedding and my favorite stuffed animal. 

And when I do I hope i'm wrong about my atheism and I hope in my afterlife I am very small and I hope everyone has their own version of God and I hope mine is a mother who brushes my hair and rocks me every morning in a garden everyone else thinks is overgrown but we both know is not. 

I can't cope with myself and that wont change no matter where I go. My general wellfare requires more sympathy than I could pull out of this earth even if i went outside and started pulling out clumps of grass and dirt with my hands. I want to die I fantasize about it every day. 

Im sorry if this is all weird and melodramatic. I just have nowhere else to type this out. ",1
"I apologize in advance for the long post. I'm not really sure where to start, but I guess I'll start with the fact that I've been inpatient 6 times so far  as none of these times have helped me in the long run (obviously lol). I'm still relatively as bad as I was, if not worse than when I started.  I don't want to go back inpatient for a multitude of reasons, the main one (although it feels stupid) being that I can't take meds very well. I've tried so many times, been through so many different meds to the point that my doctor has started at square one and is retrying old meds that I've already taken. Part of the issue is probably, as stated previously is that I can't take them, I physically and mentally struggle to take them, I can barely swallow them no matter how small they are and while trying to take them, and after the fact I break down and just cry almost every time because of the trauma (?) that I have with it (parents yelling at me saying that I just need to swallow it and that I'll have to learn how to take them eventually). Anyway, onto a fraction of why I want to end it. Thus far I have been diagnosed with major depressive disorder with psychotic features as well as ptsd, I've been dealing with the majority of this since about 6th grade (im currently 19, almost 20) . I've been through so much shit and been on both ends of being hurt/hurting people.  It's been years and nothing is sticking, even if I get “better” for a little while it always comes back. Ive dealt with self harm and suicidal thoughts for the same amount of time the longest ive ever been clean was about five and a half months. I've lived both with my mom and my dad full time and neither option was good both made it worse. Currently I live with my mom and it's a bit much to say the least. At one point recently she was yelling at me almost everyday for stupid shit whether it be something I did, something I didn't do, or something I did that she thought I didn't do. I am currently out of a job but when I did have a job I was working part time because I'm supposed to be starting college soon and I wasn't even making $200 a month yet she expected me to pay her almost $250 a month plus me having to buy my own food, buy everything for my animals (i have a dog and a cat, the cat is on special food that costs almost $100 for a 16 lb bag) buying all of my own food, paying any bills that my health insurance doesn't cover, paying for my own phone as well as anything else I need/want. Anyway, I've got about a week, give or take depending on when I finish the notes, if I even decide to finish them at this point.  Feels like I don't really have any other options than to just end it. Anyway, sorry for the yap session if you made it this far, thank you for reading &lt;3 ",1

"The reasons I'm suicidal aren't important right now. I have a nice cocktail of drugs and alcohol that will almost certainly kill me and a rope tied such that I can put my head through and my own body weight will strangle me just in case. The problem is, it's terrible timing. 
My little brother's boyfriend is giving birth and it would suck if they got back home to find me dead, on the day their son was born. So, the obvious answer is to not kill myself. But I honestly don't know how I'm going to get through the next 24 hours. The urge to kill myself is very intense and I am struggling to resist it. I talked to a friend (about other things, not suicide) and I'm a bit calmer now, but the urge is still there enough that I'm at serious risk of killing myself tonight. I thought of calling a helpline but they will probably send cops to take me to a hospital, which might be what's best, just to physically keep me from ending it, because my willpower might not be enough. ...But I also have a final paper (that I actually want to write) due next Tuesday (in 8 days) and a trip to a convention I really want to go to (and plane &amp; convention tickets were expensive) starting on the same day. So, if I go into a psych ward, even if I put in my 3 day notice immediately, I would likely have to ask my professor for an extension, and might have to spend precious convention time writing an essay, or just fail the class, which would suck. If I don't go, I might die, which...I can't say it would also suck, because it sounds pretty good and I won't care about not doing xyz if I'm dead, but it would suck for other people, especially my dogs.

TLDR: I know there are ways to survive suicidality even when your urges are much stronger than you are, namely by making suicide impossible, or at least very difficult. But those are logistically difficult at the moment, and I'm trying to decide whether to chance it on my struggling self-restraint or just call a helpline or go to an ER. 

If anyone has advice, tips, or other solutions (except dying), please comment. What should I do?",1

"I’m turning 22 in a few days and there is not one reason I can think of, to continue living. I recently failed an exam. I spent 70 hours a week studying for my master’s exams, just to  fail one of them. If I fail the  retake in a month I get kicked off the course, that’s like £20K down the drain. The money came from my parents and my brother, they’ve always supported me in terms of my education. My brother and my mum kept saying you better not fail, you know how much money ive spent and I have no faith I will pass. The amount of guilt I feel for all the money anyone has ever spent on a useless person like me is weighing me a lot. I worked my ass off for this masters, I went to classes every 5 days a week 9-5pm, studided after classes and still failed an exam. I passed 2 exams but the way my course is built is if I fail one I fail the entire course and get kicked off. I’ve wasted so much money and time just to fail and I have no faith in myself that I will pass. It might be cowardly but I really just want to kill myself. Other than my mum and dad no one would miss me in the world.

Right now I think the best course of action is just to end it. I can’t really think of any other options as I’m just tired to living

That all being said I’m drowning. And it’s all self inflected wounds. I think that’s why I feel so pathetic. A lot of people would give anything to have my situation and I can’t even make it with that. I don’t want to feel like this I really don’t. Lately I’m just not seeing any other way. ",1
Hello I want to end my self. I'm stupid useless and don't deserve to be here. I wasnt the best person at my job and was always scared and slow. I feel like committing suicide is the best option for me. I'm a waste of space and I'm a burden to everyone around me.,1
"im tired and im sick and im done. i can’t remember the last time i felt happy. actually i cant remember the last time i felt anything at all. the thought of even the people closest to me being happy makes me sick with jealousy. they don’t know how blessed they are to even be able to experience that. everything keeps going wrong for me i tried telling myself it’d get better but everything has always just got steadily worse. there are days that aren’t as bad but they aren’t good days they are just not as bad as usual. all i do is sleep and work 24/7 and im not allowed time off work because i work a shit job that i can’t leave. 3 of my friends are on vacations right now and the jealousy i have is unreal. the jealousy i have when they even get a day off is insane because id quite literally kill for that. i dont look forward to the same things others do i feel like im simply holding on waiting for another moment when ill feel alive for a spilt second thats all i want. my life is so good yet i am so so unhappy. my grandpa almost dying, my mom in hospital, my close friend SAing me when i was drunk. all within a few weeks and all of which ive had to just suck it up and work through. ive cried for hours at work everynight for months straight and i get punished for not working hard enough. i tried to step down from my role as manager and they won’t let me do that either. i suffer more than everyone around me and its not fair i want to feel something i want to be happy so badly but it doesnt come and i physically dont have it in me to try anymore. its always 1 step forward and 10 steps back and i cant do it anymore",1

I had a boyfriend like last month, i finaly felt like  im doing something right like it had some meaning but then he left me, out of the blue, just said he didnt love me anymore that its not my fault.

I'm 24. Over a 100kg weight, 38 BMI. Extremely procrastinating. I masturbate everyday. Multiple times if possible. I lost 2 years after my 12th because of my procrastination. Another 2 years in between college. About to lose another year, because I couldn't get enough credits.
My father died. My sister 8 years younger than me, she's low IQed, got mentally ill last year, Now taking medicine, she's alright now.
My mother just bears with me, she looks at me like trash.
I have got no skills for any job, not the field I'm getting educated nor any other field. So obviously no earning.
I don't even know why I'm here. I couldn't even phrase my words. Don't know what I'm expecting. Just say it's not late yet or it's already very late. Just say SOMETHING.
Is there anybody else that's as worse as me? Is there a person more deserving to get called a SCUM of a human?

They get gfs by holding a girl until she agrees to date them. I cant do this because of the social anxiety i developed because of how ugly i am. I hate my own race, wish i was never one of them.

"I am 23F, from Australia. I have been seeing a psychologist since I was 14. 
I’m diagnosed ADD, Depression &amp; Anxiety. 
I have rather significant self harm scars on my arms and thighs from my teenage years. 
I’ve been in contact with what they call the Acute Response Team from the hospital but they’re dropping me soon. I went to PARC (prevention and recovery care) for a little over a week. 

I’m living in a caravan and my boyfriend is paying for my storage unit full of my furniture. 

I used to have a car and a house but spray painted said car, crashed it smashing a headlight and cracking something in there…idk dawg car shit wild. 

Anyway, my dad committed suicide when I was almost 2. My mum did a great job raising me but when I was 18 I got into a bad relationship. After leaving said relationship I moved in with an old woman who…was…helpful in the beginning. And then I had a scooch of psychosis because I was smoking a lot of cannabis. 

I’m on vyvanse, pristiq, birth control and Quetiapine 

But I’m still suicidal. I’ve had the thoughts since…forever really…I thought people hated me but…they didn’t. Now I’ve made sure that people hate me. Not enough for them to come after me but enough for them not to care whether I lived or died. Obviously the people who do care about me don’t want me to and it hurts to think about them being sad…I cry almost every day…I used to go to uni but haven’t…I used to have hope…it’s gone now.

"Long story short. I changed career paths about 5 years ago.

Have no debt, no payments, everything to live for except for a relationship/work life balance cause right now i enjoy my work so much and im going to grad school for it i will be occupied for the next 2 years......despite all of this....i still want to put a glock down my fucking throat every waking second im not thinking about fixing a problem.

Emotionally i am being attacked nonstop with self hate. Tired of meds that dont work. Tired of alot of things. The way i stress out will ultimatly lead to early onset heart disease or dementia, which ever one gets there first is up to biology.

"I feel so alone lol...

  
Yet I don't want to interact with people, I don't even want to see someone.

When my family texts me, at times I wish they would just leave me alone... I fantasize about the thought of having no one in my life.

Although I have deleted all social media, I still use YouTube at times and when I see someone. Can be anyone...It just makes me depressed. I don't know how to describe it, I just want to die. 

Every morning I actively ignore the mirror in my bathroom because I don't want to see how I look. Sometimes when I eat or just the thought of food... just makes me want to vomit.

When I see someone I know, I can barely function. My anxiety just goes through the roof. Even with my siblings... I feel like I don't even know them. I don't feel comfortable around them.

I was raised by my grandparents and I have not seen them in years and when I do speak to them... I feel like I don't even know them. In the past I would try to show some excitement that I am talking to them but they would respond as if I was stranger. 

I don't know how to describe it but having fun or just the thought of having fun just makes me want to die. Its practically cringe worthy to me... even when its nothing special.

I just feel like I can't enjoy life. Anything related to enjoyment makes want to die? I don't even want anything from life really... 

One that that always surprises me is that, there are actually people in this world who enjoy life. Who wake up in the morning and are excited for life. People who simply have friends. People who know what they want. People who are not afraid to live in the moment. 

In my short time on this earth I have come close to death once, and I think about it everyday. If I had died that day, I would have been liberated from this pain. It was an accident so no one would suspect anything and I would be able to live this world knowing I did not hurt someone in the process. '

I also think about what a funeral would look like. I often hope people would not care. As if I had one wish, it would be that I did not interrupt their life with my death.

My therapist wants me to love and accept myself but I don't understand why I should. There are obviously hierarchies in life.

At a certain point some people are worthless and everyone knows this bc they will treat you accordingly. But when the people who are worthless come forward the answer is to just love yourself as if you arent told differently by everyones actions. I just can't wait until I will finally get to die.

"23f i moved out of home one year ago to live with my friends a state away. i did it with very little money but i had to leave. i have ptsd and other disabilities i dont feel comfortable sharing and i had completed a 6 month out patient program before moving away. 
my friends had to help me with rent that first month, when i lost my job in novemeber, and last month. 
i work in schools as a para for kids with autism and have for five years. this past year i had a gap in employment due to a workspace that was abusive to their students. 
since i work at a school i dont have anywhere to work in the summer. i applied for summer jobs as early as april and may. 
im supposed to be moving to a new place on thursday. the rent is 700 and the deposit is 1000. my previous rent was 780. 
i applied to over 30 jobs and didnt get anything. ive had to supplement with babysitting which has also been unfruitful and only able to pay for my medication and medical bills. 
aside from the deposit, i have 3000 on a dental credit card i need to finish paying off because my disability makes my teeth crack like clay. i have 2500 for a trip to the er last year. i have 1000 from an inpatient i stayed at overnight. i have 500 from urgent care visits when i needed stitches and blood tests. 

i dont know what to do. my mom has already paid for a hotel so im not homeless with my cat before i move in to a house i do not have the money for. i 
dont know what to tell my new roommates. the past year decimated my friendships i had with those i lived with. ive already sold my sentimental gold jewelry i had and im trying to sell my old acer but the screen doesnt work and requires an extra monitor to see it so i dont think it can actually sell for more than 400 in that condition. i am utterly and completely distraught. taking myself out of the equation isnt an option because it would leave my cat with no one to take her in my family already has two.

i tried to start a bank loan today. i knew i needed to have rent and deposit. i knew an amount like this was coming. i knew it and i didnt know how to stop it. im a weak person who wasnt ready to be an independent adult and  i have made people who love me literallt pay the price force it because of what i am incapable of. i dont know what to do.

Okay, so, i don't even know. Uh, k, so there's this thing that is a constant for me it never stops and so far doctors don't know why it is that way. 

So pretty much I'm always cold. I'm never not. Like I feel cold no matter how hot and sweaty I get, I can never feel warmth. I have a natural fever like I literally always have a fever. To other's I'm really warm/hot but to myself I'm freezing cold no matter what. Like even when a room is warm I don't feel it. 

Is becoming a big problem, especially since I do get infections sometimes and I can't feel if the ares is warm or not. And with other things is just becoming a problem.

I do suffer from many things, so my speculation is that it's a combination of them, but I'm not sure. The doctors don't agree. 

I have/do suffer from ED along with lots of other mental and medical things.

"I'm so tired of this life.

I suffer from constant anxiety. I'm actually not bad at socializing, but I struggle to build durable social connections; every time dark feelings overwhelm me (which is often), my instinct is to get away from people and brood, so I have very few friends. I've met countless cute people at college and had interesting conversations with them, but due to my own problems these interactions never bloom into something meaningful. I feel very lonely and suffocated.

I used to be a high achiever in school and I study in an elite college due to my high grades (equivalent to 1468 in the SAT for Americans), but for some years now I've developed a sense of apathy; I no longer have an inner drive to achieve and conquer new heights, I just don't care. The constant stress and competitve atmosphere drive me crazy. I skip lectures and struggle behind, and as a result I have finished only one semester's worth of courses despite being here for two years. They're likely to kick me out by the end of this semester, and if they do I could only return in two years' time - when I'll be 25. Twenty-five years old without a real profession and without future prospects. 

I know that if I wouldn't live to my full potential, I would spend the rest of my life feeling sorry for myself, regretful and envious of people who made it through. I don't want such a life. I'm so sick of being constantly worried and tired and sad and lonely, I just want to rest forever. But my family would be sad. I feel especially bad for my mom and my little sisters.

I've tried meds,they hospitalized me and i was abused there,gave me wrong meds and refused to talk to me or change it, abused  kids there. I can't imm so tired of it and those flashes of kids there can't leave my mind they just come out of no where and i can't tell it to nobody around me because they do not listen or try to understand. My ""friend"" that i was very close with was just calling me to say how she's so happy for herself and is going to college, while i was sitting behind a phone chewing on my lunch thinking how she doesn't GAF about me and could care less. She is talking to me about her friend and saying she's stupid then hanging out with her again then again shitting on her, i'm sooo stupid for just listening to her whining and not cussing her the fuck out for being a stupid bitch. I don't have a relationship with my mom or dad ( i live w them but we don't talk much) like nobody in this damn stupid world care enough for me to stay alive. I wanna do it soso bad it's not even funny anymore. I'm fucking mentally ill, lesbian  and a bad person. There's nothing for me to stay alive anymore. Being a lesbian is nothing bad but my parents or people around me won't see the same like they would be even more disgusted of me and it's another reason for my parents to trash talk me. I was thinking of popping a bunch of pills and drinking strong alcohol with it or just jumping from a tall building. ",1

"Basically since graduating college I’ve lost all my friends, my family, and my hobbies. I’m currently homeless living out of my car. My debit card is overdrawn $200. My credit card payments are coming up and I’m about to default on my debt. 

To make matters worse I was offered my dream job 2 years ago right after graduating, in my favorite city in the world, where all my best friends and Roomate’s and ex girlfriend are from and live in. It was an entry level position but after 2000 hours of working it I’d be promoted making six figures. My office also had an ocean view in one of the richest/nicest parts of the city. My family didn’t help me with moving to take it though. I worked all through college also and made $15 an hour plus tips at a bar plus money from music gigs but didn’t make enough to save for a move post college. 

I am just really struggling to cope with what is and what could’ve been. I got another job in my field that only paid $20 an hour because the more conservative state my family is in doesn’t bother funding my field. I ended up losing it due to mental issues, a raise dispute, and a new supervisor that was just terrible. 

In my mind I should be making six figures by now, with an office on the ocean, surrounded by my best friends and loved ones, practicing my hobbies regularly and making money off one of them, and basically living my dream. 

Instead I’m homeless and my life is a literal nightmare. I bought a gun recently to ensure I never truly end up on the streets if it comes to it. I worked with the homeless and my father is homeless sleeping at bus stops around my grandmas house eating out of dumpsters. I will never let myself end up like that. I’m just struggling to bring my self to pull the trigger and thought it would be easy. ",1
I’m actually so close to doing it.i can’t take this anymore I hate life it’s so unfair. Every time I get happy again and get hopeful something just knocks me down again and I’m  just done. The only thing stopping me is that im a wimp and I don’t want to go to hell cause my relationship with God isn’t very strong. Also I can’t find a way to do it that doesn’t sound painful. I was gonna overdose on Benadryl but then people said it hurt so I guess Never mind. If someone actually finds a way that isn’t painful please let me know.🙏🏼 ,1
"I think I was born to kill myself. Maybe I’d be successful one day. The world is not for me — I’m too sensitive and I worry about everything all the time. It’s cruel and unforgiving, and I don’t think it will ever be better. There will be days where I don’t feel like dying completely, sure, but those will just be distractions. The reality is that I am miserable and that will never change.",1
"I don’t know what to do anymore. I’ve been trying so hard to do everything the best I can’t but I’m at a breaking point. I have severe anxiety and my stress levels are so bad I feel sick every day and feel like passing out. 

I’m currently waiting on an appointment with a psychiatrist for anxiety medication but I’m just so done I don’t know what to do.

I’m 19, I’ve never started driving. Both of my parents are addicts and I haven’t had either of them to help me. I’m trying to go get my permit today (hopefully/I have an appointment), but I’m SO behind in everything.

I don’t have a job (I dislocated my knee at my last one and haven’t been back since). I need a new job, but don’t drive yet so I’m working on that but I need to buy a car, which I can’t buy without a job.

My financial aid was taken so I no longer have help paying for school.

I’ll probably be dropping out of college after this semester. I can’t take school anymore. I’m not even interested in what I’m going to college for. The job that I actually want doesn’t require a degree, but it does require a LOT of time, work, and money to some extent. 

I have no friends. I’m extremely bad at socializing and I’ve been that way for years. I’m not attractive and I don’t generally share a lot of interests with most people. I don’t know how to meet people and when I do, I’m the world’s driest person without even realizing it.

I also hate texting / being on my phone all the time for that reason 

I’m trying so hard to just focus on myself and getting things together but it feels like every time I try to make any progress, I’m being sent back so much more. 

I have no money left. I had a ton of money saved up and I’ve had to spend almost all of it on school and emergencies with my dog. I’m currently left with $800. I have almost no clothes that fit me. My shoes are falling apart. I have two pairs of underwear left. My back pack is literally sewn together because the straps fell off. 

I have to take my dog to the vet again because he hurt his leg and that will easily be $300 MINIMUM. I have to pay for my classes this semester too, which will be around $600. 

I’m going to have nothing left in my account. 
I still have to get my other wisdom tooth removed and I have jury duty coming up. I need to go get my blood work done and have another appointment after that, which I have almost no time for and I’m supposed to be saving up for surgery but I now have no money going towards that either and can’t save for it while I’m saving for other things. 

I just don’t know how to deal with all of it alone. I feel so overwhelmed I don’t know what to do. 

For the kind of work that I want to do, internships are really hard to find. I was planning on leaving next summer to go do the internship which is out of state, but i have to have EVERYTHING in order before then. I have to have a car and license, have as much money saved up as possible, make sure my dog is doing well and figure out what I’m doing with him during that internship. I need to figure out my college situation and my medication. i also have to build my other basic skills up before that internship, which costs money. I’m transgender and was hoping to get top surgery before that internship, but now I don’t think that i can and I might have to postpone that internship another year because I have to afford it and I can’t/won’t be able to go work if I’m healing from the surgery. 

I don’t know if I can keep going or not because everything seems so uncertain I have barely anything done and it just seems like i’ve been digging deeper and deeper into a hole i can’t get out of. ",1
"I’m hopeless, broken, and falling behind. I think I let God down.

"I take two doses of antidepressants, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. I fucked up my timing and didn’t take the afternoon dose at the right time today. I noticed because I’m now suicidal, and took them, but they haven’t kicked in. 

It’s scary and demoralizing as fuck to know that I’m one missed dose away from being right back to being depressed and suicidal. It’s also weirdly invalidating because I’ve done so much therapy and stuff since my last attempt, but apparently the antidepressants have been doing a lot of heavy lifting.

I don’t think I’m going to attempt tonight (no energy to get off the couch)",1
"M16. I’ve had this friend who’s a girl who we’ll call J. And we’ve been friends for about 3 years now. And how we first met was she was dating my friend. And they were together for about a year. And me and her got along really well and would talk frequently. I thought she was pretty and like I said we liked talking to each other. But I never really wanted to date her or anything so never asked or mentioned anything like that. Also especially because she was with my friend as well. Then they broke up but me and her kept talking because we became really good friends. I considered her probably my closest and best friend. But I still never mentioned anything about dating because I was honestly fine with just being her friend and also because I thought there was no way she would ever like me back. I have depression, anxiety and Body Dysmorphic Disorder as well as Facial Dysmorphic Disorder. Then she got a new boyfriend like a year and a half ago. And I was fine with that and we remained friends. Then they started having problems and “broke up”. A couple days after we were talking then she asked me if “I had some sort of attraction to her.” I decided to be honest and although I was hesitant because I was afraid this would ruin our relationship, I said yes. To my surprise, she said she was attracted to me as well and even said that when she was with my friend when she saw me, she thought she chose the wrong person. She said she always thought I was handsome and all this stuff. Then we went on a couple of dates and hanged out a lot more, and everything was going really well. Also side note and I’d rather not talk too much about it. But I’ve had a couple of incidents with self-harm and although it’s gotten a bit better, I still have thoughts about it every now and then, and my anxiety and everything else I mentioned is still really really bad. She knew this as well as the fact that I had to go to both a psychiatric residential home and the emergency room because of those incidents. And again, I don’t want to talk too much about it. But she was more like dominant I guess in our relationship while I was more submissive and she would comfort me and help me feel better when I was feeling really sad. We even took things to the next step if you know what I mean. And part of why we were friends and why I was attracted to her besides her looks was we had a lot in common, like, emotionally? We’ve each had really hard lives and could vent with each other and comfort each other. So she was complex and we could relate to one another. Also she wasn’t a complete idiot. Then it turns out her and some of her friends already had planned to go to this theme park with her ex. So even though she ‘didn’t want to’ she had to go and be with him again to do that. They would argue a lot when they were together, like a lot a lot. And after the theme park, everything seemed fine. Then like a couple of weeks later we were being intimate together and stuff. Then a while after, we started talking for a long time because she was feeling really sad. Then the next day she completely ghosted me. Turns out her ex contacted her again and promised to ‘change’ and bought her a locket or something. I guess she really liked that. After not talking to me for about 3 days she started talking to me again. Says basically let’s just be friends again because all that happened too fast even though she instigated all of it. I was heartbroken but said fine. Stuff was sorta okay for a bit. But I felt like I genuinely wanted not to exist and like I’m a huge fuck up and to be honest, sort of used and manipulated. And so badly just wanted to be loved. My at home life is pretty terrible, my parents divorced and are both really poor and in toxic relationships and not very nice to me to say the least. I eventually told her how I felt. And she said that she really does love me and meant everything she said. But I felt like she just felt guilty because she knows of my problems but was lying. I told her basically what I’ve said up till now and how horrible and badly I missed her. We talked a bunch about it. Then she asked ‘do I still like her?’ I said yes. Then she said let’s not talk for a month or two thinking I won’t like her anymore after that time. I had no choice but to say yes. And now I just really miss her and her kindness and love. And want to be friends again or anything really. Just to be loved. And I’m not really sure what I should do, I feel like I can’t move on. And like it could’ve worked. We had no issues whatsoever. Not a single argument. But to her I’m just a number 2. A second choice. And feel really really not good. I found a way to communicate with her after she blocked me on everything. A lot happened. We tried to just be friends. She kept sending photos of her with her boyfriend and saying how they’re gonna get married. She talked to me a lot less and also started acting different like a lot less nice and sorta like I was a joke. She then told me that her boyfriend fucking hates me now and so does all of his and her friends. I got mad and said I hate her. She didn’t like that. I told her I didn’t and I just hated myself and how I feel about her and was blinded by my emotions she didn’t care. Blocked me, no way for us to talk now. I tried to kill myself decided not to for my family. Now I don’t know what to do. I feel unlovable. She was the only person to treat me with any kindness or love and allowed me to have friends. I’m truly truly alone now and want to die. I still love her. And she hates me.",1

"Hello everyone. When I was about 13-14 years old, I struggled with horrible depression. I promised myself that if things didn't get better before I turn 18, I would end my life. Things actually did get so much better for a year or two. But recently, I fell back into that dark place, with no hope left in me. My 18th birthday is in a little over a week, and I'm genuinely considering going through with my promise.",1
I'm fourteen and I've dealt with some horrible things in life and some are worse than others for example I have lost so many people both pets and friends and I have dealt with two pedos before and I even have a verbally abusive mom who just shouts at me every day and I'm sick of it I can never find peace and the rare moments where I do find peace it's interrupted by my mom and I even killed myself before I was born as if I knew I was going to have a shit life but I was brought back from the dead and I just feel as if my mom nor father nor my sister care about me and I have tried many times to kill myself but I keep holding myself back thinking that maybe my mom would learn when I speak to her about it but it doesn't matter if I tell her she hurts me with her words because after a few days she'll just go back to her old ways and I am thinking of killing myself fr this year since life has genuinely fucked me over since I was created.,1
"I'm 25, have no life goals, have a dead end job, have very few friends (I do have a wonderful fiancé for whom I'm very grateful for though), dropped out of college at 18, don't even have a drivers license. I feel like I'm going absolutely nowhere in life. I'm just an absolute low-life loser. I have autism, adhd, severe clinical depression, anxiety, ocd, and cptsd. I have tried several different medications with little success. Therapy has helped some, but not really eliminated the most pressing issues. Every day feels like a chore, and I feel a pit of despair inside me at almost all times. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I can hardly even get out of bed at times. I just feel like an absolutely worthless sack of shit. I know that there are steps I could take to improve my life, I guess, but I know myself too well to think I'll actually do anything about it. I feel absolutely paralyzed to do anything for some reason. Even if I did, I doubt it would improve how I'm feeling all that much. I've had recurrent suicidal ideation since i was 9, and it's there regardless of my life circumstances. This isn't even mentioning my anxiety, it's gotten to the point of borderline agoraphobia. I'm too anxious to even talk to my family, I've ghosted friends over it, sometimes it even gets in the way of day to day life tasks. I suppose it's also related that I'm MtF, I've been on hrt for 5 years, and I'm still too scared of what others will think of me to transition. I can see my poor fiancé getting increasingly frustrated with dealing with me, despite their insistance that I'm not a burden and that they like being around me. We've been bickering a lot more recently. Well, i guess bickering isn't the right word, more like he brings up his frustrations with me, and I completely agree, because frankly, it has gotten ridiculous at this point. I feel like I'm running out of reasons not to kill myself. The world isn't a better place with me in it. The only things keeping me from doing it now is not wanting to traumatize my fiancé and not knowing whether or not my life insurance will pay enough to help them pay the rest of our lease. But it's getting harder to hold on, and that makes me feel even worse because of how incredibly selfish it is. ",1

"I seriously dont know what to do. I'm in a gc with 3 people, and one of them mostly just talks about how they want to hurt and kill themselves. The self harm, and often talk about how theyre planning to kill themselves and when they are, and stuff like theyre planning to buy knives to hurt themselves. Me, along with another person in the group, always try to comfort and discourage them, but eve if we get them to back down it aways comes up a few days later. Its almost like they dont want help. Often shooting us down and saying its no point when we're trying to help. Also often questioning why I'm trying to help them. How do I help someone who barely even wants help? Do they want help? I alwas try to stay there for them no matter what, and try to get them to feel better, but its honestly starting to come at the expense of my own health. Would I be a asshole if I decide to end things and stop being friends? I sad I would be there for them, and do everything to help them get better. But its just so hard to help somone who barely accepts th help. I feel like itbarely effects my health, more like a annoyance or inconvinience than anything, and after everything I don't feel like I'm allowed to say I want to cut contact. I cant abandon them but I dont want to have to keep talking someone out of suicide again, its not as bad as last time but its still a bit draining, especially when its constant. Like multiple times a week. I feel like such a hypocrite, especially since I acted simelarly in the past, before I got better. I dont know if I can help them but I feel like I'm not allowed to leave.

"I had a long lasting psychotic break last September. Changed my personality, changed how i saw everything in life. Fucked me up real good. I got better once I evened out my meds, but I've never lost the urge to end my life. I've been battling it this whole time.  I got in a self inflicted motorcycle accident last April that took away my ability to walk normally for the rest of my life. Had to get a pretty intensive ankle surgery resulting in 7 screws and a plate. My other leg is fucked up pretty badly from a high speed wreck a few years back (also self inflicted due to lack of caring about my life at the time)

"I've been just thinking a lot recently. People say things like we are here for the human experience or to learn something and serve others but like what if you're just not having it... Like if I'm not having a good time, most of the people around me aren't having a good time, I generally am the one that starts problems and arguments, I don't really have friends, like why should I stay for the experience if the experience is shit.. and this isn't like l'm just going through something right now, I've been a shit disturber since I was born and I'm 26 now. I've never fit in not in school or teams or even in my family. Not everyone can be the protagonist, some people just are the antagonist. So why would it be such a big deal to just end the game. Anyone upset would genuinely just be missing the idea of me because no one actually likes me around now. Like, I'm not going to make plans or do anything but like it just makes me think and I can't really talk to anyone. People say life has ups and down but like I definitely can even on good days I just don’t think anyone benefits from me being around. I’m just suffering. Im making my parents suffer by still needing to rely on their support and not really being able to give back. My siblings suffer because we have no real relationship and so I’m just the shitty kid that is taking advantage of my parents. I’m in a pipe band and don’t really get along with anyone but I’m also just kinda shit and unreliable so they don’t really benefit from me being around. Most importantly I’m not benefiting. I’ve been an outcast since I was born, job market sucks, housing market sucks, this society only likes straight white skinny people and I don’t fit in that box. Idk, literally why would it be a bad thing. Everyone would benefit really. ",1
"My girlfriend broke up with me randomly a few nights ago after us hanging out and being all affectionate. My uncle is in the hospital right now dying from sepsis in the ICU and they don’t know if he’s going to live. My job just fired me and to top it off my car’s completely broken so i’m home-bound with no choice other than to be stuck in my burden of a mind.

The last time my suicidal urges were this strong was when I was first diagnosed with PTSD after a severe attack that almost killed me. I think about suicide all day and night, life seems to just be getting worse and worse and I quite literally can’t take it anymore and I am so genuinely exhausted and done with this pointless joke of a life.

I was also born in the wrong body, might as well get freedom from it for once. I really do think for once in my life i’m going to be selfish and take my own life eventually. 

I can’t do anything to prevent it at this point, I want it so badly I know i’m going to cave in one of these nights and finally do it. And it pains me so bad to even admit how selfishly I have wanted to die for years upon years.

I want to die, hopefully I will soon, I probably will soon.

My life’s so completely pointless and just not right at all, it’s not worth it. It never was.

Hopefully I can get a peace of mind soon. ",1
"I'm 35 (f) , and when I was 32 I met the love of my life. She was 13 years older than me, but that never mattered to either of us. She was bright, bubbly, mischievous in the best possible way and the light at the end of a very dark tunnel for me. I won't say my life has ever been easy. It's been marred by severe parental abuse, a stint of homelessness and the loss of my 2 year old son when I was 30 after we were hit by a drunk driver while walking home from the park. I won't go into details about the shit sandwich I experienced before I met my love. I guess it's not relevant. Myself and my love fell in love quickly, and were living together by the time we had known each other for 6 months. It might sound crazy, but I knew with every ounce of me very early on  that she was the one for me. We never really left the honeymoon phase of our relationship. We were just deeply in love. Two weeks ago, I lost the love of my life to a sudden aneurysm while she was at work. For 14 days I've been planning how to join her. For 336 hours I've been writing letters to our friends, donating my belongings and cancelling direct debits/notifying service providers that they'll no longer be required. Tonight. I think I'm going to do it tonight. I have everything I need to get the job done. I just need that last bit of courage.

"Good day! 29M.

Pain is my most loyal companion. Not leaving my side for even a second. That is why I want to leave it the only way I know.

I have had a life of and dancing and movement, which made my life bearable. For the last 3 years I had severe chronic pain, I can't walk properly so all of it gone. Recently I got nerve damage in my arm too, and lost my sense of taste and now I am restricted to canes. ( I have been to several doctors, surgeries, methods so far ). Because of the above I can't even do any meaningful exercise because of the pain.

I have no close friends, no significant other, people are distant when I bring up so I feel ashamed of my condition. What hurts the most, that I cannot take care of myself anymore. I am at the mercy of others, the pity of others. I feel like I am nothing and the condition is worsening. I think I could help myself if I had a little hope for reducing the pain and helplessness, but I feel it drained me out too much already.

I don't want to watch the world go by me, as I have for 3 years.  
So I thought of ending this suffering sometime in autumn. Thinking of death feels me with peace and calmness which I haven't felt a lifetime ago (as it feels for me).

I am truly sorry if this doesn't sound urgent enough, but had to share with someone.

I feel asleep and woke up with pain again, the whole day I'm on the verge of breaking down. My dad passed away last month and a month before that she broke up with me.

 I'm just existing for my mom, sister and my two dogs. I had to quit my job and come back to my hometown to live with my family. My mind is messed up, I don't think I'll ever be normal again. It's fucked up and all I think about I death. I feel empty yet the mind is filled with endless thoughts, it feels like it could burst anyminute. I wish my heart would just stop. Ive lost my happiness, i am not able to create it again. I try, trust me I really try but I just am not able to. Time is not healing. It's not helping. It is not getting better and I don't think it will ever. ",1
I’m ending my life the day before my birthday (my birthday is August 8 so I’ll die August 7) I don’t want to be 16. I don’t want to live in a world like this and I haven’t since I was 11. I’m planning on taking a bunch of pain killers and slitting my wrists and if that doesn’t work then I’ll just overdose and try to fall asleep.,1

"I don't really know what to write about. It's my fourth time deleting the long paragraph I wrote for this post because it seemed unauthentic or just cringe. I guess I was trying to put my feelings out into the world, but my mind is so fucking broken I can't even properly do that. I just want to say I'm a terrible child, brother, friend, and student, a cheat, fraud, liar, loser, whatever. I have people who love me but all I can do is hurt them. 

I can feel myself growing more lethargic and weak day by day, like my body knows what a sad fuck I am and is trying to self-purge. What a hellish existence. Maybe I'll do one more final selfish thing and empty a bottle of drain cleaner into my stomach.

"random account. 

I’m 17, 5 months ago I self discovered myself as a pedophile, I looked at all the online resources  to figure everything a pedophile does, what occurs and the warning signs. I was determined to find out 

I was confused and stressed out and I still am because before that I was perfectly fine but sometimes it could occur later in puberty. 
It didn’t make sense, I liked girls my age and older so for that to happen was sad. 

Never looked at cp, but my inhibitions feel weak, I’m pushing through it. after finding out that it was true, I took meds to see if It could go away forever, ssris and sleep stuff. I’m on  40mg of Prozac. It still is happening and I have a high sex drive. I wanna try something to get rid of my libido. 

I knew pedophiles stared at kids, and thought to myself i would never do that. But it manifested 
I do long stares at kids, no thoughts just 
 compulsion and repressed thoughts that form nothing. I just want it to stop because I want to go back to normal I’m still 17 I want to live life.

I’ve been turned by  thoughts, but I feel super ashamed. it’s only happened 8 times.  

I feel so unlucky to be born that way, everything was going awesome and I had to born a pedophile. If I could find a fix. I would do it immediately.

"I've came to the conclusion that stabbing my neck is the most effective way to die. I have a good life with good friends and a majority good family, but I want an easy way out of everything. I haven't seen life as something worth doing. I just sit at my fucking computer all day doing hot shit when school's approaching and I have zero purpose. I do not see a timeline in which I am a valuable member to society and I refuse to deal with a fucking boss at a 7 dollars an hour job when I turn 18. By the way I barely turned 13 so that's cool too. I fucking hate my own grandmother and I feel so bad. My family knows she's narcissistic but she is old and I don't want to have these feelings. This is awesome added on to the fact that most of the people at my school suck and the friends I do have I don't want to tell this to and for some reason I don't care. Also doesn't help that i am annoying as fuck. Pretty much the only reason that I am still alive is the fact that I will go to hell if God is real and the accounts of excruciating pain for minutes of people who have tried the method I am going for. I am kind of confident that I will die with enough research done on where to strike but pain is still a factor even if I get my wish. So here's the plan. Thursday is the only viable option I have for suicide as it is the only day nobody will be around. So I have a game for you: convince me NOT to commit suicide by Thursday. I won't make this easy though, I can give you counter points. I'll try to reply every day but I usually don't commit to shit except this. I've been wanting this since I realized nobody outside of my family liked me around 6th grade and all my memories of shitty things I did came back to torment my ass. At this point there's nothing stopping me that I can't counterargue coming out of my head so I'm looking to you guys.",1
My depression lingers like a constant black cloud no matter what I do and the constant resentment of living against my will and for other people is destroying me and making me consumed by anger and bitterness.

I'm drinking hard alcohol before noon today full of dread about life and my future. I had meds and quit taking them due to side effects and zero benefits. Therapy and doctors have been useless to me.

I went on a website that have mh resources and I genuinely thought to myself, am I really considering dying just because of a fucking job? 

All I’ve been wanting lately is to end up in the hospital just so I don’t have to make decisions and can have a break. It’s so fucked, but it’s all I can think about. I ate a McDonalds just now and I feel so sick and I’m pretty sure I’ve got indigestion, but all I can think about is that maybe that indigestion is me about to have a heart attack or something. A part of me is *hoping* that it is. A lot of me hopes it isn’t. (It’s not).

I just need a fucking break. I made a post a couple of months ago about needing to get away. I still fucking feel like that. But that post made me feel seen. The amount of people that commented on that, I felt like there is another way out. 

I wish I felt like that more. Like I’m supported. 

I just want to lie down, and sleep, and breathe, and not have a single fucking thought in my overwhelmed head. That’s all I fucking want. 

But I’ve got to wake up. I’ve got 4 days to do a shit ton of work. And the more I put it off right now the less time I’ll have. I’m so fucking on edge. Please someone just wake me up from the goddamn nightmare. I just want to sleep, please.

in my 21 years of living I have not once had a relationship, I do not know what love or happiness is all I'm feeling is misery and anger

I don't have a single friend since I ended school I'm all alone

I'm an introvert, I don't go outside I don't drink nor smoke I don't go to bars I don't meet new people and id love to meet new people but I simply cannot

sometimes I think whether its just gonna be easier for everyone if I were to do it maybe it would solve a lot of issues

people say its a permanent solution to a temporary problem but this problem has been temporary for quite a few years now

"Hi :)

I am writing this because I can't tell anyone in real life.

People see me as a success, I have a good job. I graduated from a professional course, I have lots of friends etc.

My life went downhill just over a year ago, I started a new job and was bullied by the bosses. It escalated to online bullying that was reported in the local news.

People made websites suggesting I should be killed. I became depressed and withdrawn. Its funny how when I was successful, going out, meeting people etc I had lots of friends. When I needed my friends the most I had no one.

Today the police came to my flat, I was alone as usual. I was told that someone said that they were coming to harm me and they had a van and knife.

After 3 hours of questions they left. Most people have someone to call after getting news like that- I tried and everyone was busy.

I sat there for 2 hours, then I decided, I am going to kill myself before someone does it to me.

Months of death threats have taken their toll-I can't live in fear anymore

No one will miss me if I am gone, nobody calls or texts anymore  
The police had 9 months to do something but they did not, I do not think anything will ever happen  
I cant work, I lost my career  
My family will understand suicide more than murder.

Its 10:30pm, I said phoned my mum as usual, smiled at the receptionist. Everyone thinks everything is normal, and that is good no one will discover me. I cancelled all appointments, told people I was overwhelmed and taking time away from my phone. 

I do not want to be discovered until its too late, I made up my mind. I have been feeling suicidal for months, but hanging on in case stuff got better.

I still think stuff can get better- I just do not have the energy or bravery to hang on until it does.

I don't care if people make up stuff about me when I am gone. No one was there when I needed them, no one cared enough to just talk.

Fear was the final straw, but loneliness and isolation weakened me.",1
"I want to go into the forest and look for a tree I can spend the rest of my life with. By the rest of my life, I mean until I die from hunger or thirst. I can't live with my thoughts anymore. PTSD flares unexpectedly and I can't fake it anymore. I default to being numb because that's the only way I can cope with the shit happening inside my mind. 

I wouldn't want to hang myself. I know dying from dehydration or hunger is a slow death but at least I'll be completely empty in my last days and at least my body can decompose quietly. ",1

"Unlike other adults, I don't have the best set of life skills in the world.

Not only would I have to suffer the emotional pain of losing them, I might end up homeless as well. Granted, even with the strained relationship I have with my parents, I'd still be incredibly hurt by their passing.

Point being, I don't know what else I would do in my life after they're gone. Living is so fucking expensive and tiring, I don't know if I'd be able to survive on my own when I inevitably lose them. And my lack of life skills won't help either. I just feel so fucking lost.",1

"Me and my Boyfriend met online and are long distance. We’ve met in person multiple times and he’s coming to see me again soon.  I am so in love with him like I know he’s the one. He’s a genuine sweetheart and it’s so refreshing in my generation. He talks about getting married and growing old with me. He’s the first person to give me hope about my future, where before I didn’t think it would exist. But I’ve been struggling with multiple disorders and having a hard time recently. He’s been incredibly loving and patient with me. He has never gotten upset with me despite all the outbursts I have. 
Noticing these things, I’ve changed how I react. He makes me calm. But I have an increasing fear of being a burden as I’m getting older. This leads me to withdraw from relationships because I’m scared of being abandoned. Sometimes I’m so triggered or depressed that I don’t text him for hours, which is a lot because we’re both very clingy. He has the same issues as me just less impulsive about it so I sometimes realize I’m treating him this way, and he’s just as scared as me. I’m better than  when I used to go days not talking to him, Although the urge is still there. There’s just so many things that I feel guilty he has to deal with. Every time we talk it’s about my mental health because it’s all I’m thinking  about. And then later I feel so vulnerable and embarrassed for being too open. I feel like he’d be better off without me , I talk to him about this a lot and he just stands his ground that he will love me forever. I feel like I don’t deserve him. I don’t know why he is still with me and at this point i think it’s stressing me out more than him. I’ve been in and out of the hospital the past few years, I feel like my personal life is too much for him. I’m not a normal person, i don’t want to get a job I don’t want to eat or talk or do anything. He has goals and money and a life and I just feel below him. A few weeks ago i was in a slightly better place where I thought I’d work on myself so I could have a future with him but it’s getting worse again, and I feel that it’s unfair for him to be with me. Is the answer obvious? He’s my best friend and I genuinely don’t think I’ll ever love someone again if it’s not him.  I have no one else and I don’t want anyone else. I don’t want to keep him from his full potential because he has so much ahead of him. Neither of us will ever break up with each other. I promised. I know I don’t want help.but I guess this is me subconsciously asking for it. I strongly believe I’m going to die by suicide young and I’ve thought that since I was 10. I’m thinking about how it’s my only way out, and I’m going through the process of realizing that. No one  can  control me but me. I was not meant for this I’m scared",1
"I'm a 24 yo male. Always had the thoughts but didnt consider it seriously till last year and the entire year was hell, i always calmed myself down by thinking about the pain i would put my family in but that started to lose its affect. Whenever i try to open up about it to a friend amost every time its the same suggestion which is to change my routines, having a Job that i dont enjoy at all and almost hate, but those are not the problem but the results of living with a worn out soul and burnt out psychology for a decade. Whatever i do i do with pain, i do it cause i want to be done with it even if its supossed to be a fun, joyful stuff. For years i thought having someone in my life would solve some of these problems and help me get rid of the depression or whatever it is, but i started to notice this is now a permanent mental state, dont want to work, dont want to love, dont want to have anything, always being in pain and agony led to constant fear of loss,cant trust myself for enduring any process, cant trust anyone else to love, share or even to talk sometimes, dont even know what i expect from sharing here, entered the app with a hope to find some effective ways to off myself but found myself here.

"I’m 13, I’ve had a good enough life, I mean, it could have been better but im not going to complain when I know there’s worse, I just don’t want to live anymore.

I don’t want to grow up and spend thousands of dollars on an education for a job I won’t even like for money I can’t even use because it’s going to taxes and the government until I’m old and grey. 

I'm scared. There’s nothing to do, nothing to see, climate change is a huge problem but not enough people care to fix it because they either think it’s pointless or they’re rich and healthy and they don’t want to focus on problems other than themselves, there's not going to *be* a future for any ""next generation"" because nobody cares! 

I don't know what I want for myself, I don't know if I want to be a girl or if I want to cut my hair and get top surgery, I don't know if I want to move far away or if I'll just stay, I'm so goddamn indecisive it's so stupid. 

Anyway, back to what I was saying, life sucks, everything is pointless, nothing feels real, and I just want to die.

"Sorry for the length, had to get this off my chest.

TL;DR- Diagnosed with TS years ago and feeling horrible because of it. Now I'm dealing with the problem of forgetting on top of that and I don't know what to do.

Hello everyone, it's nice to hear there are communities like this one that are there for those who need it, to which at this point I'm willing to try out for myself. Hell, I'd try anything to get rid of the thoughts I get every now and then. Sorry if I don't make sense, it's currently 4 AM and I have yet to sleep.

I (19 M) have been feeling negatively about myself for a while now. One of the lowest points I've been has to be a few years ago, before and after I was first diagnosed with a condition known as Tourettes (I'll shorten this to TS). To keep it short for those who don't know, TS is essentially involuntary movements split into motor and vocal tics (I make random movements and noises). I'm currently taking medication for it, and sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.

Before I was diagnosed and got treated, my tics happened constantly, which started becoming a problem in 6th grade and progressively got worse. Every day, especially in class, I would make a (very loud) noise every few seconds and adjust my neck and shoulders every now and then, which I still do to this day. I was bullied for it, and to be honest, this condition makes me feel like an anomoly whether or not people notice. March of 2023 comes around and I see my neurologist who gives me the diagnosis of TS. I was sad but thought nothing of it.  Now that I found the problem surely there'd be a solution, right? Well, my life started falling apart after that. 3 months before I graduate that same year, I come to find out the career choice that I have been preparing myself mentally for all these years does not become the option for me anymore. The reason? The medication I'm taking has the side effect of drowsiness, which is a huge deal. I've had to scramble to find another option, having to decline my acceptance into my dream university. The military isn't even an option either, as they require I be off the medication for a while and I'm heavily dependant on it. I took a gap year because of that, but I've found a new path to take. Even so, I've dreaded myself since I'm feeling like I'm falling behind everyone else and the opportunities lost that I would have had had I been a perfectly healthy guy.

Then comes the other issue I've had to deal with. See, I think I'm a somewhat decent person to be around, but the issue is I tend to forget a lot of things all the time. And when I mean ""a lot,"" I mean anytime someone tells me to do something, to look for something, or to even recall a memory from not too long ago (like from conversations we've had the day prior), I would not be able to recall it at all. It's gotten to the point where my parents and anyone I talk to become frustrated with me, and it's making me wonder about what is even wrong with me. Recently, when my girlfriend talks to me on the phone I kept repeating the same things to her on multiple occasions. When she called that out, I immediately got self conscious about it and didn't know what to say or even do. It even affects the way I handle things at work. Whenever I'm given a task, I have to constantly ask what it was I was supposed to do. I'm surprised I even held the job for an entire year (it's my first part time).

Both of these issues make me think I'm such a burden on whoever I interact with. I don't want to suffer like this anymore. Sure, I'll forget about these feelings one day and act like my normal self again, but it's only a matter of time until I really get to a bad point. I am looking to take advantage of my college's therapy sessions, but if that doesn't work, I'm considering giving up. Why should everyone have to suffer for my mistakes?

I just want this to end. For everyone's sake.",1

"You know how it is when you are struggling with suicidal thoughts for years and years. This year I finally snapped . Prepared everything (not that well$). Made some videos for my family, friends and stuff. Went to the beach and stayed their until the moon was shining. No one was there to prevent me from doing it . No one was there to save me neither . Ngl I was terrified as fuck. My biggest fear was deep sea and I still chose it to be my grave. You know what’s crazier ? Is that on my way to the beach, in my heart it really felt like I was already dead. I was just taking the road to meet my judgment. Even at the beach sun was rising like it was my time. I pictured my whole life and felt happy . I felt free . I felt grateful. So at night I took 4 or 5 sleeping pills, handcuffed my self and jumped into the water. Since I’m a good swimmer I managed to get far with the strength of the waves. I didn’t even notice I was far from my initial point. I can clearly remember it as  nightmare I had . I was drowning. Omg the pain. The salty water getting in my mouth and my nose was horrible . At some point I couldn’t even manage the strength of the waves. I don’t know what got Into me cuz it was blank at a moment (maybe cuz I was under water). I just jumped off the water and shouted “I DONT WANNA DIE YET” . I used all my remaining strength and manage to pull myself out of the water. I ran as fast I as could. Grabbed my backpack and my shoes and ran to the road since there were many crimes on that beach. I got home. At least no one watched my videos . I torn apart all my letters and deleted all the videos. Since then even while in the taxi back home, I was thinking.   I realized I own myself . I realize fuck this shit  man. I’m not letting anyone ever again to push to these extremes. I can’t put everything I feel in this post but. My point of view on depression, suicide, life , friends , family, girlfriend changed. I’ve being too altruistic my whole life. No more . Now I’ll think about myself first ! I have so amazing things to live and discover IM NOT LETTING ANY FREAKING HUMAN TO TAKE THIS FROM ME EVER . ",1

"I don’t want to keep trying and trying to stay alive. I want to go, I don’t want to suffer here nor in the next step if I do it.

It was a short trip from my house (where I live with my mom, grandma and mascots), but I’m struggling a lot here.

I have some lorazepam 1mg pills (14 pills) and some alprazolams 1mg (I have 8 and a half) too I think. But I don’t think they will do anything if I take all of them, I would probably just die from my heart stopping? Sorry, I’m an idiot and I don’t know how these pills work. 

I want all of them to suffer, except maybe my mom, grandma and I will miss my mascots dearly, all of them.

Extra: My mom tried to kill herself with pills and a knife when I was around 6 or 7? But nothing worked.

"I've tried killing myself before, I took a bunch of pills and was hoping to just die and get it over with but my family found me and called 911, getting me to the hospital and stopping anything too bad from happening. After watching me for a couple days to make sure everything was out of my system and that I wouldn't have any complications, they sent me to a behavioral health unit and I was stuck there for around two weeks, I honestly think it made my situation worse, I was separated from my family, constantly dealing with anxiety and had a couple panic attacks, I was able to leave after those two weeks and went back home. I'm thinking of killing myself again but I'm afraid that if I fail again(no reliable way to kill myself, family doesn't own a gun or anything), my family will get tired of me or I'll be stuck in a BHU, with no way of knowing when I'll be able to leave. Another thing that terrifies me is the thought of jumping to my death or hanging myself but surviving and being alive, only to have to deal with being paralyzed or having brain damage but I'm honestly getting to the point where the more I think about it, the less it scares me and I have no clue about what to do, I've tried talking to professionals, I've tried taking medication, but nothing helps and I just don't know what to do at this point, I'm only twenty but I've been dealing with depression for around 6 years now, I've slowly lost interest in doing anything, I haven't actually talked to anyone irl besides my family since the end of middle school and I just have no motivation to do anything in life at this point, I just can't imagine having to live for another 40 years, going through the motions and just doing enough to survive.",1

I have no hope for things getting better, lost all opportunities, have no friends. All this made my already bad depression and ocd even worse. Only thing keeping me here is my mom, who supports me. Sometimes, it gets too much and i want to end it all. I just want to be at peace.",1
"Last night I was in a really dark place after being in pain about my marriage for quite a while, and could not get out of thinking about how nice it would be to just not wake up the next day. I was home alone, with several prescription medication and alcohol available and the thought was honestly tempting. 

I realised I should reach out to my husband who were an hour and a half away, because I really didn’t want to live anymore, but at the same time I kinda didn’t want to do it and wanted help staying in those thoughts of not doing it, and of course I wanted to feel like it mattered to him whether I live or die. 

So I texted him around 10:30 pm and told him that I was in so much pain that I honestly hoped I would not wake up tomorrow. At 11:50 he responds with a text “anything I can do to help?” I had put my phone on dnd because he hadn’t responded earlier, so I didn’t see that message right away, so he sent a new text 40 minutes later saying that he had just eaten and was going to bed, and that he hoped I was sleeping well since I didn’t respond, and told me that I could try calling if I needed something. 

When I read his replies my stomach honestly dropped. I mean he is supportive in his replies, sure, but I might as well have been dead or already have taken an overdose, and that was why I didn’t open his message. That was all the effort he felt necessary when his wife said she wants to die, and he was able to just go to sleep after that. I would never be able to sleep if he told me something like that, and then I couldn’t reach him. I would be on my way home, calling him like crazy, even sending the police or ambulance to check on him if I couldn’t get a hold of him. And I know for a fact that he has jumped in his car at 3 am when he thought someone else could possibly do something to themself, with them not even saying it direct like that, they just said they needed him. And he told me just one week ago, very strongly, that I had to tell him if I had thoughts about unaliving myself. 

Am I overreacting on this? “Luckily” I had already had a couple of drinks and two sleeping pills, so I was really sleepy when I read his reply, but my immediate reaction was that it made me wanna unalive myself more. ",1

"I’m killing myself because I hate my body. 

I’m 16 and I’m a boy. I’ve been straight through out all of elementary school but found out I liked boys in the beginning of middle school. I told some people since I thought that other people were exaggerating about people being mean to them once they came out which I was quickly proven wrong so I’ve never told anyone since. 

I have 3 friends, everyone is friend with my main friend mark (fake name) who is very popular and funny. The other two Jayden and Kyle are just my “friends” because I’m friends with mark. Every time I think of my friends I keep thinking about how much they would like me if I was a girl. How maybe they’d find me actually interesting if I was a girl. I know how starved guys are today and I just think that maybe if I was a girl they’d probably want to be my friends. 

 I hate being a boy and I’ve always wished I was born a girl. The way I really want to act, to dress, to live would be seen as weird if a boy did it. I want to wear skirts and I want to be a dumb nerdy girl boys found cute. I’m pretty attention starved since I spend all day alone in my room without human interaction so I always think about how girls get so much more attention from boys. I’m always envious of them and I wish that I could just switch genders and become a girl. I want to feel pretty, I want to feel cute, I want to feel feminine, I want to be the weird nerd with weird interests I already am just this time in public, maybe I can be who I really am with my friends and they wouldn’t find it weird because I’m a girl. I feel like people would accept me for who I am if I was a girl. They’d pay attention to me if I was a girl.

"Sorry for the long title. My husband has been planning on taking our baby away from me since I gave birth three months ago. He wants a divorce and wants to take our child. Not because he thinks I’m a bad mother, because he knows I’d do anything for this precious baby. So I’m not really sure what he’s getting out of it.  He works long hours every week so he said he will have his family raise him. That thought depresses me because not a single family member of his has come to meet the baby yet (again, he’s 3 months). They just don’t seem to care for him and that breaks my heart. 

I’m a stay at home mom so I don’t have any income to hire attorneys or help. I’m also originally from Europe and here on a green card, so I’ll have to return home if we divorce and he’s already made clear that our baby will stay here with his family as he was born in America. 

I haven’t left his side for even an hour since he was born, and the thought of seeing him maybe one month out of the year or nothing at all makes me want to just give up. I don’t really want to live this life without my child, and I don’t want him to see what a loser his mom is. I just want this suffering to end. ",1

How am I supposed to believe people care about me when only one of my close friends cared enough to check in on me that night I was in the hospital for an attempted suicide? When people said they assumed I attempted suicide when I went to the hospital? ""Yeah that's what I thought."" when they asked why I was at the hospital. Not an ""I'm here for you"" but claim to be my friend. It's like I'm dangling off a cliff and they turn away because they don't want it to be their issue or they assume I can pull myself up.

For the past 8 months I been on Accutane and unaware of it's impacts on my mental health. This past week I took double my dosage to be healthy and take my meds and make up for lost time. But in this I became so unstable and ruined my life in 72 hours. I am still feeling the effects of the pills and have almost killed myself in 2 encounters.

I lied and manipulated the truth based on my intrusive thoughts and anxieties. I told 5 people who I never should have told this to, I also should have never said this, because of their closeness with my now ex girlfriend. I called her horrible things like a manipulator, gaslighter and predator, when she is none of those things. I just was so scared and overwhelmed by my feelings and thought everyone was out to get me.

I just feel like I am stuck in a loop of hating myself and feeling not enough since I was little, but Accutsne has caused me to ruin my life, I destroyed my friendships and relationships with my now ex girlfriend all because I couldn't trust they loved me. 

I feel like I did irreparable damage and deserve to die. I know how stupid this situation is but I am scared by how much I have been cutting and gotten so close to suicide.

3/5 of my friends have accepted my apology and say they want to continue being friends. My ex girlfriend is still not responding to me after 3 days. I feel like I just failed the world and actually deserve to die.

My boyfriend is the only thing keeping me alive. The fact my death would destroy him and he would be lost without me. I love him too much to take myself out. But I often wonder and fantasize about the sweet release of death ,1
"Since a month the only person i ever cared about, the only person who made me feel loved left me, i just feel like I'm already dead. For some time now i just think on how to end. I'm a weirdo, i never could feel anything for anyone, since literally ever, my parents love me, i have a family i wouldn't want to trade for anyone but i never could feel anything for any of them, nor friends. And now that the only person who i ever felt something and made me feel loved doesn't want me, i even dream of ending my life. I try to distract myself with games, the work thing i go, and had 3 days of vacation with my family. Nothing is helping me to think of something else. I don't want to die yet, i don't want to make my ex feel the guilt and burden of my death, but my mind doesn't care what i want, nor my heart that won't stop loving my ex.

 My “friends” keep belittling me and making fun of me every time behind my back and I only found out when my close friends were in on the joke. It’s just too much that I just think that they’ll just treat my life as a punchline when I finally do it. ,1
i’ve been told it for the last 8 years now and it only seems to be getting worse…,1

I'm a trans girl and I also love Christ. I felt honored at the Paris Opening Ceramony. As a Trans Follower of Jesus, I feel like this is the true message of Jesus! I felt like finally, LGBTQ+ are a part of a holy image. But oh no! The antichrists of the world have to stomp all over me and my friends hearts. Its like do these supposed ""conservatives"" care that suicide rates are high for trans and lgbt people? Do they care that now, they just may have caused even more suicides of these poor people, (including me), since they had to open their stupid mouths?!? Why do I fucking exist! Wtf is wrong with me?!? Am I missing something?!? As far as I know, the only one to judge and convict the sins of another is God? Why does ""The Far Right"", or should I say ""The Far Wrong"" want to play God?!? Did Paul not tell us that ""They will know us by our love""? Who asked for their opinion and hate? As a christian, I love EVERYONE! I DO believe that the LGBTQ+ community have a room in the Lord's House always! Sure as followers we can guide people, who WANT our advice. And lets be honest here ok? Jesus' ministry was not made of holy people! lol A prostitute, a tax collector, a highly trained assasin, rebels who violated Shabbat and the Torah, and even maybe a few Romans and let's not forget Paul who was a bounty hunter and killer of Christians! Considering that, this might be the closest we've gotten yet to a modern day equivalent of that true Last Supper!

Tl;dr
Far right or rather ""far wrong"" political extremist views make me as a trans girl who wants to serve and follow Christ with all my heart and share the good news with others in the LGBTQ community, feel worthless and like I should take my life because too many people are trying to play God.",1
"I can't handle the pain of living anymore. No one will miss me when I'm gone. I have no one, and I mean nothing to anyone. I've been struggling for years, suicide attempt after suicide attempt. I'm just a waste of space. Everyone I have ever loved has made this very clear to me. I know how to succeed, I would've succeeded last time if it weren't for having the cops called on me and getting to the hospital just in time. I'm not sure why I'm posting this. I guess this is my final goodbye to the world since I don't have anyone to say goodbye to. I hope everyone on here is able to overcome what I have failed to. I hope everyone is able to make it to tomorrow. Watch the sunrise for me. This is it. Tonight, I'm going to finally be set free from my trauma. Tonight I will finally be able to rest.",1

Another way is to use a rope. My parents will suffer but continuing my life in a miserabile way is makes them suffer too. 

Im also a burden and i have clear in my head those who told me hurtful things. I can use that to fuel my determination to jump. I know i should not think about it. Im losing my job. I lost friends. Maybe if im drunk i will jump more easily. What should i do? Im scared of myself.",1
"21m and I’m deadset on ending it once I finally move out soon in about 1-2 years. Ive dealt with depression and anxiety since I was 14 and while it did seem to finally go away at the start of 2023, by 2024 it all came crashing back down to reality and I just know I’m fucked. College is way too fucking much, I have zero skills in anything, very introverted, and the one relationship I had has mentally fucked up and scarred me to the point that I don’t think I’d be able to sustain or work out another relationship ever again, being ugly af doesn’t help either. And by deadset I mean I’m not even sad about it anymore, or angry or hesitant, just feel like it’s destiny now and I’m just trying to enjoy whatever much time I have left. I’ve tried therapy but it seems dumb as hell and isn’t really doing anything, and I don’t want medication because that’s not fixing the problems, all they do is make you forget about them and if I wanted to do that I would’ve just went to hard drugs already instead. I had a good run but things are in the final stretch. ",1

I hurt my keg pretty bad th the point where i cant hide it. Idk what to do besides t wear pamts in 90f weather,1
"This is an alt account for obvious reasons, I want to maintain the most anonymity I can while still having someone to talk to about this. To preface, I think I am a pretty good person in most ways. I love my family very much, I love my gf (yes I have a gf and did this) more than anything else and if it wasn’t for her I would be out of here by now, I’m kind to retail employees, etc etc

I don’t think anybody could really guess the monster I am sexually however. There’s a lot of ways this is the case. I beg God if there is one for a lower sex drive so I can kill this part of myself and let the other parts flourish. I’ve always kind of knew this and felt ashamed of it, but esp whenever I take stimulants, which isn’t often but often enough to affect my life negatively, this monster comes out and I have no conscious mind. I will masturbate to the most depraved shit without a second thought. Well today is the day that ends, because now I’ve fucked up so badly that I snapped right out of it

My brother was sitting off to the side and he somehow saw my phone and was like “is that [his gf]?” I said no and quickly tried to actually hide my phone. He was like “really cause that looks like her hair?” And I was like “no it is not her but I’ll admit I am ‘wasting my time’” (meaning wasting the stimulant when I should’ve been working). 

I immediately felt guilt like I’ve never experienced before and like I was about to have a heart attack. He asked me that again a few more times and I kept denying it. I couldn’t tell if he believed me or not. Even if he believed me this is still the worst thing I’ve ever done and he would be suspicious of me. I was thinking of how I have no choice but to give my life to Jesus or something now to deal with this horrible thing I’ve done. I want to end myself and whilst I’ve had some very very low moments before, I’ve never truly seriously considered actually doing that until now. I realized that I’m likely gonna have some kind of ptsd from this so I immediately dropped whatever I was doing and started playing Tetris as I’ve read that that can help reduce ptsd from traumatic moments. So since then I’ve been bawling my eyes out just not able to think about anything else. I deleted the photos of course. I went to r/ confessions to read about some other peoples horrible decisions to maybe not feel alone at least. Went to top this month, this year, all time and none of it compared to this which made me feel even worse 

Yes I only feel this soul crushing guilt because I was caught, but it is genuine. I guess from my experience I’m learning that sometimes even if people are only guilty because they’re caught, perhaps that brings out a guilt that’s genuine sometimes. I hate myself and am still seriously considering it and I just need someone to hear this 

Every time I take a moment to truly think about this again, I just feel more convinced that my only option is suicide. I don’t see any other way out of this ",1
"I feel hopeless, empty and my life is over. there's nothing I can do.

I am so far behind in life, I have and own nothing. No career, still in school.
I am so loney. I don't feel appreciated and don't have any close friends.

I used to fear what will happen to my mother. But at this point, I am so numb and careless.

I have a lot of cyanide to end it all. I just want to rest in peace.",1

Im stuck fixing everything. Keeping everyone and everything else together. Legit,  everyone depends on me. And they just expect that i will keep my shit together, and keep going. And i typically do. But only cuz ive never really had the option not to. And im tired of it. What if I don't want to figure it out? What if i don't want to be okay? What if i don't wanna pull through? I'm tired of saving everyone. Im tired of trying to break generational curses and undo 4+ generations of trauma. I don't want to keep fighting. I don't want to be responsible anymore. Im just do tired. I want to throw in the towel and have people just accept it. Ive always stayed for everybody else. And im so tired. I lived for them, i just want to die for me. Don't i matter that much? To be allowed to say i can't do this anymore?",1
"I honestly can't see myself in a future I'm happy. It's been years and this feeling doesn't seem to go away. I've been a self harmer for years but I guess that's not enough anymore either. cutting myself doesn't make the pain go away. Nothing seems to make. I've come to a point all I think about is killing myself. Hanging out with my friends? I'm thinking about suicide. At bed after a long day of school? Thinking about suicide. Going out with my family? I am thinking of suicide.

Also my family is the biggest reason I want to kill myself. I can't seek help in them. tbh, I don't think there's anyone I can reach out to seek help. I'm alone. I've been too scared to kill myself by cutting myself but I guess the pain of living has become bigger than the fear of that. I can't stand it anymore. I can't.",1
"I am planning to end it sometime in August. I don't know if it's against the rules to mention the method, but I will 100% jump from a bridge. I am going to Berlin on August 13-15, and from what I researched their bridges that overlooked water are quite low and if the impact doesn't incapacitate me I know how to swim so it will probably not work. so while I will scope it out when I'm actually there, I might not do it there. If i don't find a suitable spot, I am next travelling to London as I know for sure there are bridges high enough there. The thought of finally having a way out of this miserable life that is entirely my fault feels so freeing - I finally feel at peace and even excited. ",1
"Two weeks ago I tried taking my life I decided that it would’ve been best to do it alone. So one morning I woke up alone and I first tried electrocuting myself with a toaster but the best I got was a little spark. Then after that, I tried to do it with an electric shocket twice but it was just very painful for me. Next, I tried hanging myself but the strongest thread in my house only held onto me for about 30 seconds. I was basically alone that entire day but then I tried poisoning myself by drinking all of the chemicals in my house and to this day I'm shocked to how I survived all of that I'm not lying when I say this I did fail that many times and looking back I'm glad I somehow lived but I still feel like there’s something wrong with me idk what.

My purpose is other peoples fullfillment, and if i end it now I wont be ale to take care of the people I love anymore, and knowing a lot of then are dealing with depression makes me never want to talk aout my true feelings. I feel as if Ive completed my turn in this life, like theres nothing more I can contribute, the only passion I have is music and my bestfriend of 14-15 years, who isnt my bestfriend anymore, he told me it was a stupid little kid dream I neededto let go of. I wanted to study to be a lawyer or veterinarian and had a scholarship from stanford at 15, but he begged me to stay because he ""needed"" me. I stayed. Last year i wasmeant to move to a different state and him and the girl i was w at the time, who he turned on me for, begged me to stay because they would be ""lost"" without me. I wanna be angry, but Im too tired. I only have the urge to fight now and I dont like to fight, but its all I want to do so i start one whenever i get the chance to. I want to make music for my friends, but idk who really is anymore, everyone calls everyone brother but I feel like Ive got no family. Which i do, an older brother and youner set of twins. We were all adopted into different families and no ones met the twins, but my brother wasnt the best to me growing up and I considered myself an only child after being told our bio mom tried getting those 3 back because they have the same dad.

I only have a passion for music now, its always been part of my life, its the only thing that allows me the space to feel emotion without being labeled a b*tch.

Music is my life but idk if its worth it because while i do want to speak for the silenced. I dont know if anyone will understand that its more than a pay cut. Its more than women and dr**s. 

I wish I wasnt so exhausted, I wish I was a better person, I wish I was as brave as people think I am. But im weak, and im tired and exhausted and i want my best friend back an idk how to explain to people that while I do love them, I wanna be with thepeople that genuinely loved me back, but theyre all d3ad and thats all they hear when I say it. Then its back to how theyd feel with me gon and I understand but Im 18, my best friend, my first love, the dad that raised me and his son, my granny and so many of my other friends from childhood are gone.

Im 18, Ive been to 1 funeral when I was 4.

I've been to 25 funerals as of February of this year.

All I have the passion for is music, and the 'friends' i have that say theyll support my music dont understand its more than just the 'vibe'.

Idk im lost, im sorry this is so long, but youre not alone in how you feel and I love you dearly even if we dont know each other. 

I love you",1

I took a year off of school to help find myself and I feel worse off than I’ve ever felt before. I’m just tired of living a painful and lonely existence while I see everyone else having some sort of life. I feel like a burden on my family by not leaving the house much, having a job or any sort of social life. I know that my family loves me but I know that they don’t like me which makes me hate myself even more. The only reason I haven’t committed suicide yet is because I don’t want to cause them that pain. But I don’t see my life getting any better anytime soon, and I don’t know how much more I can do this.

I simply can't handle working 8 hours a day, going to study, and only getting home at 1:50 AM every single day. I can't stand the people at my job, and I've managed to argue with all of my coworkers. Instead of just ignoring me like I do with them, they do everything they can to get under my skin; it's torturous. As if work wasn't enough, I have to deal with a classroom full of students I don't like, with ideals, personalities, and tastes completely different from mine. To top it all off, I have no peace at home since my mom can act like a bitch with me and treat me poorly, even though I bend over backward to please her. My dad only communicates with me through orders. I honestly can't take it anymore, and I don't think it's worth continuing to push through college just to finish, knowing that when that happens, I won't be living the dream life.

"I know to many this many seem stupid or down right silly but all right now I need is a voice. A few days ago my boyfriend blocked me. We were talking then he hung up and I tried calling back and he ain’t answer then my dad called and I was like omg why you hang up now am stuck on the phone with my dad and he got really upset. For a while now he’s been saying how me not been able to spend time with him call and how it makes him upset.
And I totally get where he’s coming from but there’s just a lot going on in my life right now. I have a friend group that’s really demanding and I have first stage kidney failure.
But still them are all not good excuses for cutting him off and not making time for him but now I just don’t know what to do.
Like I can genuinely see myself making out high school with him and marrying him someday so when he does stuff like this, it just makes me really sad and go back into my old mentality thinking I’m useless and that nobody cares 
And yes, he’s done this before where he’s blocked me, but there’s also been a time where he was genuinely seriously wanting to break up with me and I don’t know if right now this is him just trying to take a break from me breaking up with me 
I would like to think that he’s not because I know he’s the type of person to be straight up and say he is, but I just don’t know 
And he was the first person I ever talked to in-depth about my depression and how I really feel about things so losing him is like everything and I really hope that’s not the case but I just don’t know
And a lot of times when he does stuff like this, it just makes me think I’m stupid. I have so many chances to keep writing wrongs and it just feels like I’m always doing the opposed 
And the reason I say I want to commit is because I’m tired I’m tired of failing him and failing my friends I wish I could just be better and do better

"hello, 27NB here. i’m in a rough place in my life right now — there’s just a lot of things piling up ontop of one another within the last 10 years of my life. i have a bipolar disorder, stemming from my dad’s side, and i’m left unmedicated (no insurance, no time / money for therapist / psychiatric visits). my mom died in 2018 from breast cancer. my dad just got diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and it’s looking grim. i work as a store manager (freshly promoted) but i fucking hate the job. i’m overworked but paid so little. i’m stressed out to the point where breathing is hard — can’t eat properly, sleep properly, i go days to a week without showering. 

there’s just a lot i’ve been dealing. i don’t even say ‘i want to kill myself’ anymore — i just say “i hate being alive / it hurts to live”. everyday is painful — mentally, emotionally and physically. 

tldr; my life is horrible and i was planning on writing personal letters to everyone in my life, like a closing chapter. friends, family, my sister,  my boyfriend, even people i hated / no longer in contact with me. i feel like this would be such a good way to finally breathe and not feel so much undeniable pleasure from finally being released.  i have a lot of good things to say about those in my life; and bad things to those that made my life hell.

"Just wanted to share some of my thoughts and how I've been feeling lately.
I just want to simply resign from everything. I utterly hate being around people, around anyone. I find almost all people to be so outright self obsessed and selfish that even the thought of any interaction disgusts me. I find that everything we do is influenced so much by others and by our environment alone that it's purely useless and futile to want to find anything you'd want to do in this world. Is it really even your choice what you choose to do and not do? I could go on ranting about this subject specificaly, but ultimately, I geniuenly don't believe it to be as such. I don't really think we have a say in what we do, if that makes sense. I just don't want to partake in this fucking world. I want everything to end. But I'm too much of a pussy to end it. Too worried about my parents. What if I'll destroy their every last hope they have with what I do? Well, sometimes I just ask myself: What if I do? What if everything turns to fucking ash if I do it. And simply because of me doing it. Sometimes I feel like it really won't even matter. All is but a moment. Everything is one. And everything is just so utterly meaningless. The lack of meaning in this world is what absolutely astounds me. Seeing what most people worry about and how they eachother, and what they expect you to do for them to accept you... It's just so pointless and tiring. It's all meaningless. I'm sorry.",1

I asked out many girls until now and no one accepted. For example last time i asked to a girl becsusd she was very nice And cultured but she said no to me.

Im learning new things every day, im Being very nice And funny agaisnt them but this not enough.
Yesterday i went out and saw many beautiful girls with guys and asked myself What I do wrong???
 im asking to myself that what i did to god? Why he punishing me with this? Why should i be alone forever? If my parents died now,i would live in a room alone forever and no one would notice if i died. Maybe after months because my body will smell.

I really fucked up and i dont know what to do, I have messed up so badly, no one would ever forgive me.

"This is a throwaway account.

I’ve been depressed since I was 10, I’ve cut since I was 12, I first attempted suicide when I was 13. I am now 16, and the past few years have been filled with manic and depressive episodes as well as multiple attempts.

I know I am only burdening my family. I have been told multiple times that I was ruining the family, tearing it apart, causing my parents’ rough patch, etc. by my parents. My parents have always been verbally and emotionally abusive. My mom in particular always finds something wrong with me and keeps on shaming me to my face or yelling at me. Every conversation that I have with her ends in her being condescending and making me feel like shit. My parents have always favored my younger brother, their interactions with him are STARKLY different compared with me. **I am fourth wheeling in my own family.** They are their own happy family and I am just at the side, unwanted. My parents have made multiple remarks about how they do not want me, and how I am difficult and just cause pain. I remember when it was discovered that I was depressed, harmed myself, and attempted suicide. What felt like the biggest betrayal was that my parents did not care about supporting me, just hiding all of the issues from other people. They did not change their ways, oftentimes treating me worse. I have no relationship with them.

At school I have no friends. Everyone whom I have tried to befriend has used me and/or excluded me. I don’t have a core friend group. I remember that I went on a few class trips, and on every trip, I tried so hard to connect with the other students, to hang out, but I was always excluded. It doesn’t help that I’m gay. I’m probably the only gay guy in my whole school. I can’t hang out with guys without arousing suspicion, I’ll never be one of the girls, (only co-ed friend groups are couples who create a clan for some reason) I’ll always be treated differently. I will never experience the things that other people my age will experience. I’ll never be able to go out or make memories with my friends because (1) those friends are non-existent (2) everything relies on academics for me. I’ll never experience young love, unlike all my classmates. No homecomings, no proms, no matching pajamas during Christmas. I feel so isolated and alone at school.

I cannot feel anything anymore. I feel like all my emotions are artificial fronts, like masks, to convince everyone that I am normal. I cannot feel happy or sad or make any genuine connections with people anymore. I was raped when I was 14, and I have felt super dirty and worthless since, which I know should not be the case but I cannot shake the feeling no matter how hard I try. I am pouring everything into academics in hopes that I get into an Ivy League school, which I know is basically impossible but I think that will finally make me feel happy. All the sacrifices, all the pain I went through, all the things I lacked, would be worth it.

I feel like God has left me to battle through this alone. I have prayed and prayed and had faith that I would get better eventually. I felt that every time I survived a suicide attempt, that I survived because He had a plan for me, that I had a greater purpose.

I should be grateful. I should not be feeling like this. My family is financially comfortable. I have the chance to travel a lot. I have a 4.0 and am on track to be valedictorian. I have all these opportunities. Yet, I have gotten rejected from almost every opportunity that I have applied for and I know that my freshman and sophomore selves would be massively disappointed if they saw me today.

I am so tired. I just want to stop suffering. I want to go and be with God. I cannot keep living like this.

I am writing this from my kitchen, where all the prescription medications are kept. I know which ones I am emptying out. I will probably clean a bit before I carry out the overdose. From every past suicide attempt, there is nothing lonelier than the feeling after attempting. I plan to do this tonight and I hope this is the last time. If you have read all the way to this point, please keep me in your prayers/intentions, I really appreciate it.",1
Maybe a cry for attention. Maybe just like a message in a bottle. Maybe just throwing thoughts out there because I don't have anywhere else. My best friend died last week. I don't know how to cope. I don't know how you just move forward. ,1
"I've been on meds since I was 16, but I've never actually stopped thinking about suicide. My other symptoms of depression have decreased to the point that I haven't needed to go to therapy in years. Its always on my mind, though. I see a household cleaner and want to drink it, I hate driving because I want to swerve off the road, I can't even play solitaire without visualizing my own death. The worst part is that these aren't just fleeting thoughts. These are developed ideas that never, ever end.

"I’m pretty set in my decision and I’m not exactly sure why I’m making this post. I guess it’s because I can’t tell anyone else. Anyway I’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts on &amp; off for almost 10 years (I’m 25 btw). I was fired from my job last week and although that does play a role in my decision, I’m pretty sure I would have killed myself eventually. Ever since graduating from college, I’ve been stuck in the cycle of going to work everyday looking forward to the weekend; then dreading going back to work during the weekend. This cycle is called life—- or at least my life and it’s gonna continue like this. I enjoy spending time with my friends &amp; family but I prefer to be alone sleeping or watching tv. Also it seems like everyone is progressing and I’m not. People my age have careers, spouses, families, etc. and I’m nowhere near that. None of these are sole reasons why I want to end my life. In short, I’m just tired of living. Usually when I think about suicide, I get anxious and cry but not this time. Even writing this I feel relaxed and sort of at peace like this is the right decision. I’m not necessarily looking forward to Wednesday but I’m not scared either. That’s another thing. The fear of not knowing what happens after death has always stopped me from attempting in the past but for some reason I don’t fear death. I’m not sure if anyone is actually gonna read this post but I’ll add a bit more information.

Why Wednesday? It’s July 31st. My best friend’s birthday is in August, my mom’s is in September, mine &amp; another friend’s is in October. Then November &amp; December are holidays and other birthdays. I don’t want to ruin that time for anyone in my life. I also want to clean my apartment really well before I go so I have time to do that. 

How? My plan is to take 8 bottles of sleeping pills and hopefully fall asleep quickly. The active ingredient in the pills is the same in Benadryl. I’ve heard bad things about that but I haven’t read about anyone taking as much as I plan to. I’m hoping I can just go to sleep and not wake up. 

I also have a note prepared so hopefully that will help the people I’m leaving behind. I have one person to thank and two to apologize to for things that happened in the past. I’ll message them on the day of, after I watch my final sunset.

"I’m about to kill myself and it’s kind of an hours long process. Just wondering if it’s normal to be crying the whole time.

Didn’t expect to be crying this much. Is it normal?

EDIT: Thank you so much to everyone for all your responses. I haven’t had the emotional energy to respond, and I apologize for that, but know that you guys really helped remind me that suicide isn’t worth it. 

Thank you to those suggesting the suicide hotline. If you find yourself in that dark place, PLEASE CALL THEM!!! A very nice woman named Chelsea listened to me vent and sympathized with me and didn’t try calling 911 or anything.

"As the title says I’m all of those things and dim constantly reminded of this. And honestly I just feel so bad for my parents, they deserve a skinny beautiful intelligent daughter like all my cousins. And all they have is an obese, got kicked out of uni due to low grades, and completely unfashionable daughter. I really do just have the urge to end it, but I know that dying now would basically be them losing all the money they used to raise me. I know I have to get out of this hole that I dug myself into. I know that dying won’t solve the imminent doom of explaining to them why I failed at uni. Dying won’t change the fact that I was a failure and even died one. So I know I have to live and pay them back for their investments.

But im honestly so scared, I’ve always been a failure pretty much and it didn’t help my younger brother was everything I couldn’t be. He was fit and smart. Whilst I’ve always been fat and dumb. All of this would’ve been fixable if I wasn’t so lazy but it’s hard getting over laziness and lack of motivation. Miraculously even with these debuffs I was able to get into a good uni with a foundation year, but then I completely failed at that aswell. I should’ve never went cuz now I’ve got 2 years worth of debt with no degree. Whilst all my cousins are so intelligent always getting A’s, they’re thin and they’re super pretty.

"Essentially, I'm having trouble wanting to be alive because no part of life is enjoyable anymore. For the past 15+ years, more than half of my life, I've been struggling to want to be alive and I'm just so tired. I'm treading water and I'm wondering if it'd be easier to drown.

The more time I spend not actively avoiding this sort of cliff, the less options I feel I have. But how do I keep going if I truly will not enjoy so much of my life. Practically speaking, I think I could get back out there and figure something out, but I just can't think of any reason that would actually make me happy. Or at least get me to a place where I have something to live for, I'm actually not asking for instant happiness.

"14F

Before I start no I didn’t joke about SA I just want to talk about the backstory on myself a little so this seems to make a bit more sense obviously not excusing the joke itself but I want to explain a little.

Throughout primary school I was sexually harassed and assaulted by a boy. Told the teachers and nothing was done. (I won’t get into it )
When I was 9 my former friend Sexually assaulted me . I believe numorous times as some of the “game” we played was very disgusting. The police was told eventually and nothing. I had got into watching YK at around 7-8 and from then , in year 8 I also had an insane yk addiction. I had strange online friends and was around alot of sexual jokes.
So a lot was just normal to me and I never thought before I spoke at all.

Now let’s talk about the day I made this joke

I was around 11-12 and me and my friend were walking to the park . She has sweets in her hand and this boy (around 5-6 maybe) stares at her. My friend says “he wanted a sweet” for some reason my thick head decided to say “the seductive stare LMAO” or something like that. I probably knew what that meant and I remember hesitating a little but then seeing no wrong for some reason . I wasn’t thinking abt the meaning of seductive I just said it. 

My friend called me out and I panicked because I realised it was wrong. I said “that’s not what I meant” we just talked normally after , she never brang it up but now that I’ve suddenly remembered this I can’t get it off my head. I was so lost in the head I said something so nasty. 

I hate myself for it, i said something that was complete against my morals.

Someone please talk to me. I need to talk about this

the home for my SI. I held my family in a separate realm of reality. This is the truth.

I cried myself to sleep as long as I could remember. Not every night; but more than a child should. There were good times but I never felt truly safe.

When I was in high school I was told sucide was illegal. The state owned my life. I promised myself that day I'd never be taken alive. I was lying to myself. I suppressed all reasons my family made me suicidal and made that comment the reason.

School was a long time ago. My family are frauds. I'm more suicidal than ever. I hope I'll outlive them. I hope one day I will be out of their horrific shadow. That one day their horrible words won't echo in my mind every minute. I also admit that day may never come.

I believe in full honesty. Not every moment with my family was awful. But that's how abuse works. You tell yourself it's okay because sometimes it is. Today isn't.

i am unfathomably upset. i am distraught. i am anxious, worried, and i wont stop hitting myself. my body hurts so bad because i couldnt get my energy out any other way

it feels like my life is ending. which, in a way, it is

and i have 0 control over it. even better /s

i want to die. i've always been too afraid of the physical pain to do it, so im not necessarily worried that i will

i have nobody else to tell this to really, so im putting it here my mom is worried. she head me violently sobbing and came to check on me and ask what was wrong twice, but i really dont know how to approach that conversation

everything is horrible and i wish i were unconscious. genuinely cannot stand living right now, its too painful

shitty thing is, he might read this. which will then make me manipulative. i dont want to be manipulative. i also dont have the energy to go out of my way and make a burner for this

overall? i need people to talk to. i really really need people. i feel so alone and isolated right now",1
"I love my family so much, but I don’t want to be me. I don’t want to live as me. I hate everything about me. 

Therapy and medication does NOTHING for me. It can’t fix the problem. Please don’t tell me to get therapy. I’ve tried it lots and it only ever, ever makes things worse. 

WHY does society make it so difficult to escape a life you don’t want? I do understand not wanting to cause your family pain, I really do, and I know there are religious people who think it’s a sin. But I wish so much I was allowed to escape. I want to be reincarnated as someone whose brain isn’t broken like mine. Someone pretty and talented and kind.

"I am obsessed with suicide

I think about it all day, every day.  Sometimes it makes me forgetful or slow because I was distracted by it.  I know it often makes me miserable, though I'm a skilled enough actor to make myself appear to be fine.  I do have genuine moments where I'm focused on something else and I'm actively enjoying myself.  I may even have pretty good days or overall good chunks of time, but the overaching theme of my life is still wanting to commit suicide.

I just want to opt out of life.  I don't want to hurt anybody by hurting myself, but I'm inching toward a time during which I will no longer care if my death hurts my loved ones.  I'm already hurting my wife with my existence.  My dark demeanor and miserable attitude.  She doesn't deserve this.  I want there to be a button I can press that removes me from existence and wipes the memory of me from everyone who ever knew me.  

I don't really want ""help"" or a change of perspective.  I want to die.  That's what I want.  I'm not interested in an alternative solution.  I'm not a fighter.  I'm not resiliant.  Yes, I'm a loser, a quitter, and a failure for not fighting harder.  Those titles don't bother me anymore.  I just don't want to participate in this life thing.  I really don't care about my wasted potential.  I don't care about my legacy.  I don't care that I don't have any offspring.   I don't want my existence to influence this life.

I want to stop being double minded and just make a decision and stick with it.  If I choose death, I need to stay on that course and make it happen instead of just whining about it like an attention whore.  If I choose life, I need to persue that and stick with the betterment.",1
"What's the point of not killing oneself? Since all of us will die eventually, I agree with Mishima's point of view, the ultimate purpose of human life is to prepare for his death. I can't stand the trash entertainment that capitalism endlessly produces. In the movie M*A*S*H, people use the most ridiculous methods to prevent suicide, which I think is ironic and pessimistic. Why does society prevent people from committing suicide even as it continues to chip away at people's faith? (I'm basically a Lacanian, maybe a bit nihilistic, atheistic and don't believe in wageslaving, communism or some shit)

Here is a quote, ""I just cannot believe this is it. This is life. There is no magical third act where | am the star in some fantasy adventure. I won't suddenly gain superpowers and fight cartoonish villains. This is it. This is all it will ever be. 50 more years of quiet, drab misery. Our one shot at consciousness is spent on something so unimaginably boring. My 'gift' of sentience is spent wageslaving, consuming media, messing around with hobbies that will never fill the void, eating, shitting, cleaning. And that is all there is.""",1

"I'm confused and struggling with not only depression but a lot of non sense thoughts and delusional conversations with myself, it hurts to see how long I faked it and ignored it. I'm tired of being like this and I tried, but it's over for me I'll not be able to take what'll come next, the emptiness and the mourning for something I didn't even do. But idk I've been acting like I did it, or like I don't have any options instead of it. I'll hang myself as soon as I get here, I'll do everything to make it work. I have to be dead it's my fate",1
"I’ve been here time and time again. The perpetual cycle of highs and extreme lows. Today I took some time and recognized how much hurt and pain I’ve carried and held onto for so long. I realize that the reason I struggle with poor coping mechanisms is because the younger version of me thought that way the only way. I continue them now because for so long the demons in my head have been my only company and my only friends. 

The angry voice in my head is the only thing that’s always been there for me. How could I turn my back on it now? 

I want to leave, I want to give it all up. I would rather feel nothing than continue feeling this way so consistently. I don’t want to keep hurting the people I love with my pain. I don’t want to keep being a burden to everyone around me. 

I genuinely believe everyone would be better off if I wasn’t here. My girl, my family, hell I even think my pets would be better off with someone other than me. I see a therapist every week and I feel guilty because I’m a lost cause and someone else could probably use her time and benefit from it more. I just don’t feel like I should be here anyone. 

But I know if I leave, I’ll hurt the people I love for awhile. In the end they’ll replace me. There’s nothing all that special or remarkable about me. Nothing they can’t find in someone else. I just don’t want to put them through that. All 3 people who would actually care. 

I feel selfish if I stay, because the people who are close to me will never really know me or have me. I’ll always have that wall, I’ll never fully trust them or let them in.  And I’ll know that I hurt them with even the smallest pieces I give them about my mental health.

I don’t want them to blame themselves. It’s not their fault. 

I’m just back in that space where I really don’t want to be here anymore. And I know if I take the next step and try again, I’ll succeed. I made sure of it. And that also scares me.

Almost shot myself tonight. No one seems to give a give a shit. I hate myself and everything my life is. Only didn’t because I didn’t want to leave my kids behind. Over at a party my friends convinced me to come to. Seems surreal in a way that they don’t know,1

My family left me again. My own adoptive child and every friend I have made. All that remains in my partner and his family. 

It hurts so fucking bad. People do nothing but use you for what you have and the moment they can get that from somewhere newer, somewhere more exciting, they will replace you. 

I'm tired. I don't wanna do it to my partner, but I am going to hang myself soon. I'm already so drunk just trying to make the thoughts stop. 

If this life is actually real then it's a fucking joke, but at this rate I'm convinced I'm in some artificial torture chamber.",1

"I am 15 and FTM. After years of begging for a short haircut, about a year ago I was allowed to get one if I payed for it. Along with subtly changing my style to be more masculine I was finally able to look at myself and not hate what I saw. Yesterday my mother told me I was no longer going to be getting my short haircuts and that I wouldn't be allowed to leave the house unless I looked ""feminine"" enough. (It should be noted even before I knew I was trans I always liked to dress masculine, this was never a new thing for me). 

I don't know if I can do it anymore, this is just another thing she's forcing upon me. I was sent to private school hoping it would cure me of not being heterosexual, being unable to talk about politics because I'm liberal and they're conservative (not even being able to criticize people hanging the confederate flag). Being told that I'm clearly not neurodivergent nor mentally struggling because they want at least one kid who's not fucked up in the mind. And many other things.

There is next to nobody I can talk to, any worker at my school would have to report me because of child safety rules, my brother leaves for college after summer is over, all of my friends have their own struggles they're dealing with and I'm the one who's supporting them right now. 

I can't do another three years of high school where I'm constantly told I'm going to hell and stared at because they know I'm different and coming back home where I can't complaine about anything if I don't want more of my stuff being taken away. Even after high school if I want support from my parents throughout college I have to pretend I'm exactly who they want me to be.

Im a dumbass,i don't know anything other than art. Ive been trying to find another collage to go to because i failed this one but nothing is available anymore, at least nothing art related but I'm a fucking idiot who cant do anything other than art. and even that is barely good, no one looks at it, my family doesn't care about it, all my friends are better at it.

"I've met her at some random chatroom around a month ago, as I tried to help her with leaving her abusive boyfriend. Now, the boyfriend has left her and she doesn't want to live without him.

She's 15, lives in America and that's absolutely all I know. The boyfriend in fact, has cheated on her around 17 times with pretty much everyone in the school. Told her multiple times that he just wants her body and doesn't love her at all. Yet she still is madly in love with him.
I've tried everything, all those pretty words, metaphors, words of support but she never wants to listen to any advice and outright ignores it, thinking the knows it the best.

Now, as he left her, she saying that she's going to kill herself to punish him for leaving her. I've tried everything but she doesn't want help or to change anything in her life nor does the want to make anything better. She says that she doesn't want to die but has to kill herself. 
I don't know what to do. I've wasted around a week constantly talking with her, but I'm not making any progress. The only word I said that actually got to her was back then when I got really mad with her and told her to do it. It was after we talked for 12 hours and it was 6 am. I haven't had any food or took a single break and I just wasn't myself. I know I shouldn't have done that. I'm really sorry.

Please, I need your help. I don't think I'll be able to live knowing that I could have saved someone's life but instead I contributed to her suicide. Is there anything I can do?

I really don't think It does, I was extremely depressed and thats standard to be honest, I've never had anything diagnosed so I don't know if I'm depressed for sure. This attempt happened months ago by the way and I'm not sure how I've been feeling since. 

For starters it was a normal day, my girlfriend at the time had broken up with me a few weeks before and I was losing my mind, id been severely unwell mentally before we got together by the way ( id wake up every day and my first thought would be suicide and I was snapping and changing moods constantly) but when we were together I was worse I would go completely numb and then start burning and hurting myself. I'm only stating this because I want it to be known it's not a sudden thing for me to feel like this. 

But yeah it was a normal day and I had an exam the next day and I was upset about the breakup, I just had a headache so I took some pain killers, about 2 then I just finished of the packet. These packets had 8 of them in, then I had another packet, and I'm not sure I cant remember now but I think after that I had either one or two more packets of that and then I had another one or two  packs of some random pills I found that said something about pain release in the body not the head so I swallowed them and my thought process wasn't I want to die, it was more so I'ma just keep eating these and if I die I die I gues it doesn't matter. 

And then I sat in my bed all night thinking and I didn't really want to die anymore but if I do its fine and I won't have to worry about anything, I then proceeded to constantly throw everything up ( not on purpose ) and then I had my maths exam and wanted to die even more. I'm really confused about the whole thing and just need an opinion on if this was an attempt or just me wanting attention of being stupid ",1

"I’ve dealt with some depression and other things like chronic pain for years now and it never seems to let up. Meds don’t really help me for pain, I’ve been on and off a variety of different meds for mental health and they really don’t help me at all. I never feel joy or happiness really. I’m just kind of numb to everything. I can’t do it because of my kids, knowing that would be a huge source of trauma for them as well as abandoning them. I have a few diagnosis that are life long and will never go away. I don’t have friends and my family circle is very small. I just see myself as a disappointment and a burden to those around me.

"Feeling comfortable around your coworkers doesn't mean they care.

Remember your failed attempts to reach out and connect with them more personally. 

(Spotify, axe throwing, etc...) Remember how they respond positively in person but never have anything follow through once people punch out? 

She always seems exhasperated or stressed when you try to talk to her face to face. The only positive engagement that felt safe was after you gave that old gift to her as a surprise. Following up on the favor she offered in return in the moment, you just feel like she'd rather not be talking. 

Oh. And shes also not interested in being friends. Neither of them are. The impression youre worried about having made is probably exactly what they're both thinking. If not that then something's off, dont forget about that weird barrier that hangs in the air between you. 

Dont let the shred of peace and contentment that your meds have have you fooled. Its a side effect. It never lasts. 

Give up. 

No one actually cares or wants you around. Any outreach that may come is just the subconscious reaction to a change in staus quo. Theyll adjust soon enough and itll be fine because no one actually cared to bother trying to stop it. 

Remember how much better you felt when youd settled in to accepting things weren't over, they never began. It still hurt once the meds wore off but at least you dont feel stupid for falling for the ""maybe i was wrong and we can be friends"" trap when the meds were in your system. 

Theyre friendly. Not friends. 

Friendly is as far as it goes and thats fine. 

When youre in your right might you actually have healtht boundaries and perspective on attachments and that self reliance makes everything okay again.

You just gotta step off the pendulum again. And this time, dont get too ahead of yourself and jump back on the instant some delusion gets your hopes up for ever being something more to someone. 

Remember the moment you physically flinched when youd seen a stranger hug a girl with such genuine care and joy in his eyes. 

Hold on to that because breaking your own heart is the only way youre gonna keep from fooling yourself again with wishful thinking. 

""We tried. Just not cut out for the ""friend"" stuff"". How many fucking times do you have to wash rinse repeat this lesson all over again with different faces and names just because you think ""maybe this will be different.""

You fucking idiot. Just grow up. People dont always get close and you always said you want to be loved organically and not force your way into anyones life. ""So im not going to ask to be a part of someones life"" right? Fucking stop moping about licking your wounds when nothing is going to change for it then.

Pathetic. 

He's not coming back.

You're not getting closure, or an explanation, or anything. 

You're left with gifts ungiven, a heart &amp; friendship that is as unwanted as you, and yet another mystery left in place of a person to have up and left you.

Because you were fooling yourself to think they were ever there to begin with, let alone stay.

Dont listen to the side effect or anything anyone says. No one cares. You dont matter. 

Lock up those walls already bc the longer you keep holding on to nothing the more youll hurt yourself

Any of those outcomes are better than living in a world that is committed to misunderstanding me and it’s better than living with this prison of a body. I’m sorry that I couldn’t take anymore. My body my voice and my face was ruined by time and puberty and I was robbed of a childhood and teen years by dysphoria,mental illnesses and the wrong puberty and I can’t pick up the broken pieces of myself I was completely shaken and shattered before I even had a chance so I never had a chance. I can’t do this anymore. I can’t live a double life by pretending to be a man anymore when I’m a trans woman but I can’t live as a woman because my chances of passing and blending it to have a normal life as a woman was stolen from me by male puberty. Please understand where im coming from if you feel anger towards me for doing this please put yourself in my shoes and imagine if you could live on if you were forced to go through the wrong puberty and deal with the aftermath of that that makes impossible  to live as who you are safely without potential deadly repercussions.

"I’ve been struggling with derealization for a while now. It’s basically the feeling of being in a dream or a simulation, and it’s really starting to haunt me. I’m well aware that this world is real but sometimes I’m so overwhelmed and stressed by my problems to the point I wonder if everything is a nightmare I’ll eventually wake up from. I’m really sad about so many things that went wrong in so little time and I can’t help but wonder what if they never happened or what if I never did anything to cause that. Life is so cruel, it’s unreal to me. I just want to end it all because what’s what if none of this is real anyway? I think about that all the time but I don’t want to traumatize the people who might have cared about me. On the other hand, I do know the world is real but everything seems so out-of-control and I feel so out-of-touch with it all.  What do I do? Is it time to see a psychologist?

ive been in therapy multiple times and it hasnt helped, its been getting worse recently to the point that im genuinely filled with dread every time i leave my house, it wasnt this bad a few years ago and i dont know why i cant just be normal and speak to people, or even just be around people.

I don’t want to be alone anymore and just can’t take it anymore. I hate having to be the one person in a group that nobody looks at or talks to.

I don't really know why but I'm still not feeling better, I have a plan that's in the works but what I'm most scared of is surviving honestly. It would be pretty embarrassing and the pain afterwards kind of worries me. 

Or the thought of being in a coma kinda creeps me out too. Especially being sentient in one. Eesh. 

Either way I'm coming to a conclusion that I'm just not cut out for whatever is gonna happen in the future and I sure as hell can't afford to be in a psych ward. So I plan to just rip the bandaid off and end it sooner rather than later. Not now, but eventually. 

I don't even really know why I want to die so bad. Things are more okay than they've been in a while but I don't think theres a time i've wanted to die more than I have this past month.

Oh well, I hope whoever is reading this has a good day. Thanks for your time.

"It is getting really hard to resist killing myself. Basically the only thing stopping me is the pain it will inflict literally on myself and the pain it will inflict on my family and friends, although that too is slowly not becoming a problem in my psyche.
I had a girlfriend for almost a year. We had been friends ever since we met in 7th grade and I had loved her, or felt like it, practically since I met her. We dated once before our freshman year, but I broke it off due to some personal issues I had. We didn't talk much but were still friendly until our senior year, where we became closer again. Her boyfriend cheated on her near the end of our senior year and a couple months later I asked her out, and we were a really happy couple with a great summer full of memories (ish I will explain later). The problem came when we had to go to separate schools for college, over 3 hours away from one another. To make a very long story short, she found somebody else at her school after we had grown apart emotionally due to an argument we had over having kids (which had us mention breaking up), and she became very close with this guy during April and broke up with me because she didn't want to hurt me any longer by dragging me along in the emotional turmoil. It really, really hurt me and I still have not recovered from it at all. But this is not even the main problem in why I am wanting to escape.
My main problem in life or with life is that I have practically no memories. I can't remember what growing up was like very well, I know it just happened. I know I did well in school but I can't remember my classes at all and only a select few of my teachers' faces and names. I can't remember family vacations at all, what we did or when they happened, even when I am shown pictures. I know my friends exist but it would be hard for me to describe their features or interests to someone, and I honestly can't remember any of the times we hung out except for the two that occurred in the past year, but there were obviously more than that. I do not want to keep living like this. There is no value any doing anything if I'm not even going to remember it. It's hard for me to recall what I did most days, even the next day it's hard for me which I don't think is normal. 
I can't resist wanting and wishing I could live in the past again either. I do feel like I was much happier back then - I really loved school, it was predictable and simple and there was time to socialize with people without it seeming forced. I just have no interests now and I can't even remember what my interests were when I was a kid. Any time I do try and get myself out of this mental slump it just feels so fake because I know how unhappy I am and how badly I just want it to end. Life's possible experiences have no meaning on me when I know I'm probably not going to remember them. 
Someone please give me advice or something. I am really trying to want to be here but it just seems so pointless. ",1
"5 weeks ago I made an attempt on my life and I was unsuccessful due to being found in the tub. I never thought I could or would try to end myself which was a shock at the time but now it’s all I think about. I’ve been very sad and lonely for a while now but I was never suicidal until that one night. 
I guess it was easy for me to make the decision initially 5 weeks ago because there wasn’t anything or anyone to prevent me. A couple of days ago I looked at my suicide note and felt nothing but despair, which drove me to begin planning to take my life properly. 
I’ve tried the things I spoke about at hospital - stopped living alone, looking for a new job, moved back to a city where I know people but nothing has changed internally. I’m trying nonetheless to get better but I think I’m only prolonging the end. I’m currently focused on saving some money so I don’t leave behind any overdrafts and can leave my family money. I’m in a 6 month tenancy and I won’t do it whilst living here as there are people who have to stay here. In the time I’ve assigned to regaining hope I’m trying to reach out but no one seems to want anything to do with me but I may try again to reach out if I have the will. 
I tried to kill myself and failed, now I’m living and trying to see a way forward but can’t. I wish I was gone the first time of trying because in the time since then I’ve only had substances to help with my day to day and I’m seeing parts of me I hate even more. I wish I had the awakening and bounce back other survivors have but it’s evading me",1

I know these feelings are gonna win, I believe I just now came to terms with it… like, it just became real. Finally. It blows my mind how (apparently) nobody knows it but me, an important and obvious detail continuously glanced over, right? One day I won’t be here and everyone, like always in these cases, will ask why and say “he seemed so happy, you never really know what someone is going through,” and whatever other bullshit people always say. Yeah, you’re really onto something, good job. It’s almost comical that it’s gonna be said about me one day, I don’t know how to feel about it. I’m pissed off right now just thinking about it actually. Of the few people I told about this, I confided in them, I told them in confidence… and they act like I never told them. It’s insane. Then they’ll join the bandwagon when I’m gone and act like there was more they should’ve done and claim they didn’t see it and had no clue. Fuck all of you, I don’t need your sympathy. Suicide is not as selfish as you think it is. Do what you want, don’t let people guilt you, because they really don’t fucking care. They know already. It’s written all over your face, I guarantee it.",1

"I have no plans, but I do have ideation. I have chronic moderate or higher depression and anxiety. I can’t remember my official diagnosis. 

I stopped taking my meds a couple months ago because I had some elevated liver enzymes when I had to go to the ER for something unrelated.

I’ve been doing pretty well overall, but I just feel like a loser and very little in life ever brings me joy any more.

I spent through life savings keeping the family afloat after I got squeezed out of a dream job at the beginning of the pandemic. I haven’t been able to find a similar job since and now I’m switching careers by going back to school.

My two step kids are very stressful. They both have ADHD and have serious problems in school academically despite us doing everything we can to help. They constantly make messes around the house for me to clean up because they won’t do it. 

My stepdaughter has become incredibly defiant to where she refuses to clean her room, do homework, or even take her medication. 

My wife and I haven’t been intimate more than once in the last two years because she didn’t want to be touched while pregnant and frankly since my son has been born everything in the house is my responsibility and it’s distressing. Neither her nor her kids will ever clean up after themselves and if I don’t do it all the house looks like a dump. 

I had a job until a few months ago but I quit because it was causing me health issues and the schedule almost lead to us getting divorced. That’s another thing that hurt my marriage, I was never around for 10 months because of the schedule.

I just feel totally ineffectual as a parent, like I’ll never earn enough money again, I’ll always be everyone’s fucking butler, and any joy besides my son has been sucked out of life.

This morning I found myself wondering if my son is old enough to remember me and eventually miss me. What do I add to my kids lives? I can’t provide financially any more, they don’t value me or anything I have to say, they don’t listen to or respect me. My wife has no problem not pitching in on anything with the house despite working a desk job (couch job) from home. If I died, her parents would take care of her and my son would be okay. I just feel like I have no place, I don’t belong, I’m not valued by anyone, and life is so painful where it was once hopeful and good. 

It makes me want to go lay in a snow bank, or go lay down in the desert and just die. I don’t think I’ll do it, but the thought is there. I hate what my life has become.",1
I want to die so bad. I am scared I will be punished by God if I do. I’m not even a religious person at all. But deep down I can’t help but wonder if I will go to hell if I kill myself. It feels so selfish. I am tired of being here. I’ve tried four therapists and multiple different medications. I am unfixable. ,1
"simple as in ""lack of options"" simple

1. you grow up, potentially with abusive parents, or none at all, with a high likelihood of receiving trauma

alternative: none

2. you go to school for your entire childhood, stressing about grades during the ""best time of your life"", being bullied if youre not 100% normal or have shit luck, resulting in more trauma

alternative: be homeschooled, inevitably get more trauma due to heightened fear of failure and lack of social life

3. you graduate, and either do yet more school just with less fear of failure but increased financial woes

alternative: get a job and waste your time on earth trying to stay alive by constantly working, being exhausted from work and sleeping

4. get whatever degree you want if youre lucky and/or skilled, get a higher paying job that still has the same issues as the former

alternative: drop out and continue with the alternative of 3 feeling like a failure

5. continue working for the next ~60 years, occasionally change jobs, maybe take a vacation

alternative: none

6. die of old age

alternative: die before then

"I've been living with depression since 2016 but I've always suffered from homophobia and bullying for years and years, and I've always thought about the possibility of suicide. This year my father and grandmother died a month apart and my five-year relationship ended precisely because I don't have any kind of long-term goal and my ex expected me to get better but that didn't happen. 

Before you say I should try something, yes, I have. Therapy didn't really work for me, it only exposed my obvious traumas but knowing about my traumas doesn't help at all. I'm poor and public psychiatric treatment in my country is very difficult to get. I've tried exercise and I never felt good doing it, the only thing I felt was tiredness. Staying away from my cell phone and the internet didn't help either because real life was just as shitty as online life. 

The only thing that held me back were my friends and my mother, but unlike me they have the will to live. If they want to stay alive, that's entirely their problem. I'm not obliged to go on living this shitty life just because of them. They're not going to improve my life and I'm not going to improve theirs.

I feel nauseous, I am on nausea meds that repress vomiting but don’t stop me from feeling nauseous every minute of every day, dry heaving over and over. I am on every prescription strength anti acid and stomach coating medicine. I have been in this pain for over a week with no respite and to the er twice, no answers.

For years I was bedridden by period pain and given no answers, for another year I struggled with severe gastritis. I healed…sort of. It keeps crawling back until this week I have been hit with the most intense, long lasting pain of my life. I am on the strongest sleep meds and it can only get me a couple hours sleep, I barely eat.

She has been in the emergency room on several occasions now dude to falls while been drunk. 

She dissapeared again the other night, when she came back the following morning with a large bump on her head and a bruised hip, i filled with rage, grabbed what i could see, chucked it in a bag and told her it was over and walked out of the door.

One of the issues is we are in a very poor financial position, she has spent so much money on booze its insane, i cant believe i didnt realise how much, so stupid of me! I moved to where we are currently for her job (which she has now lost due to her drinking) i have presicley zero friends, no family, no one to turn to. 

I slept outside last night in a field, luckily we are having a heat wave so it isnt to bad but now i am just sat in the middle of a field, watching the trains go by, thinking how easily this could all be over with, i would feel terrible for the train driver but at least for me this would all be over with.

Im a guy in my mid 30s and i just feel like im having a spiralling breakdown, there isnt any way out.

Sorry its a messy rambly post, have a great life everyone.",1
"My Dad died unexpectedly my freshman year in college. After a month of suppressing my grief it all kind of became out of control. I started self harming and continued until it landed me in the ER. During this time my suicidal ideation became more and more intense. Eventually they found out I was suicidal, and started having random strangers start knocking on my door for “wellness checks.” On top of that I found out that the university had named me something along the lines of a high risk case and were monitoring my grades and attendance. It was clear to me that I was nothing more than a liability, another reputation taint my university was trying to avoid. The closest people I had to really caring were my RAs, but I know it was just their job. This pushed me even closer to the edge. All of this to say that they treated me like shit. Now that it’s the summer they stopped reaching out, I guess it’s better for them if I end it now. I can’t drop out, but I also don’t think I can go back.",1
"I swore I was going to die before I was 18 years old. 
I am not worth it and I do not deserve everything I have, I am ungrateful. I feel so guilty for hurting everyone by attempting it twice. Now I'm crying more than before and it's always in my room at night, alone. They say that the strongest survive and I am just broken glass that can no longer be repaired. It is better that I commit suicide once and for all because I am a curse to everyone who knows and loves me. It may be that I have more flaws than strengths. Why the hell didn't I commit suicide that night? Well, who knows?
Why doesn't anyone understand me? I hate being so sensitive. People say that I am not a burden, but life has shown me otherwise. Honestly, I want to die and one day I'm going to commit suicide. They say that the third time is the charm and I am going to make sure that it is that way with my death. It seems that I'm not trying hard enough because that's all I can give for now. I do not wish that I had never been born, but rather I wish that my soul had never been created. I have fantasies about my death and I always live in my imagination.

"I don't even know where to start, but before i talk about what's wrong with me i wanna make clear a couple of things.

First of all, i need y'all to be respectful, i don't use reddit a lot, but when i posted something in the past, a lot of times there are people who likes to spread hate, even if there's no reason for it, and right now that's the last thing i need.

Second of all, english it's not my first language, and besides that i am writing this on the phone, so there will be a lot of typos, and i apologize for that.

I'm going to give some context, there's a lot of reasons i am thinking about this, i don't want people to think it's something meaningless. 6 years ago i tried to died and failed, after that i got diagnosed with depression and i had to be in the hospital 3 months, there i met my best friend, someone whom i shared a lot of memories and we helped each other through the years. That was a difficult time of my life but i've been getting better over the years... or so i thought.

Now i'm in college, i'm an archeology student, and to be completely honest i'm not sure if i want to study this career, but i already wasted 2 years due to my depression. But that's not all.

A month ago, my best friend, the one persone who was closest to me ghosted me, recently we've been arguing a lot, in fact, we never argued before, but recently happened a lot... but idk, i feel like at least we could have spoke about it to see if there was a way to get things better, or at least to end things well like adults, if that was the way it would have hurted me but at least i could move on, but no, she just started acting like i don't exist, i tried reaching out to her a lot of times to at least know if it's something temporary, to know if she's ok, or if there's some way to make things right, but she only blocked, and i can't move on, because i don't know if she's sad, or angry, and even if we don't talk anymore i still care about her, and i can't stop thinking that she's not ok because of me. And i feel bad bc i insisted a lot, and i don't know if it was the right thing to do, but you can't just ghost someone you care about.

Besides these things, i always felt lonely, it's something i had all my life, and the reason i tried to die some years ago, and it's not fair, because i have a family that cares about me, and, even if i haven't got a lot of friends, the ones i got cares a lot about me too... but in one hand i just feel lonely, and by the other hand, when i feel people is worring about me i feel guilty, like i'm only bothering them.

I wanna say that i already tried everything, i reached out talking about my feelings, and i'm getting help from the hospital, everyday 3 nurses come to my home to ask me how i am, if i eat, if i take my antidepressants... but it's not enough, i tried telling my friends that i've been thinking about suicide, but it's not use, the only thing i gain is getting people worried and that makes me feel guilty, i tried reaching out and talking about my suicidal thoughts at my best friend, but she didn't even respond, wich hurted me a lot more, cause even in something so urgent she didn't care... i feel that she never cared about me, and if someone that was so close in reality never cared, and abandoned me so easily, that means that anybody could just leave me the same way...

I'm sorry to say all this, but to be honest i'm very desperate, i don't want to die, but i tried litterally everything and nothing worked, i just feel empty, i feel like i don't deserve people around me to worry, and most of all i feel like there's no other way out. I sincerely dont wanna die, but there's litterally no other way, i feel betrayed, i feel like a nuisance, and most of all, i feel extremely lonely.",1
"I (31m) deal with obsessive compulsive thoughts of committing murder.  These thoughts are often exasperated by stress in my life.  I am dealing with one of the hardest times in my life, cannot afford a psychiatrist to find a medical solution (despite trying countless SSRI's, meds, therapy, etc.) The thoughts are so pervasive that at this point I would rather end my life than obsessively think about hurting others and dealing with constant financial struggle as well as constant heavy anxiety.  My life sucks and I'm over it.  The only thing that has kept me going is the girl that I love who loves me back unconditionally.

I know they would feel guilty, thinking they could have saved me. But it's not their fault, even if they offered to help I wouldn't take it. It's not their fault that I am a failure. It's not their responsibility to look after me. It's not their burden to fix me.

"I've these same thoughts over and over again. No matter how many times I ask people and get satisfactory answers, it'll always come back. Something that someone said and I am hooked on to this one sentence they said and I'm overthinking what they meant although I know what it exactly meant. I have had these issues for years now. I can't control them. Being a guy, I can't say my issue to others. This constant fear of getting some immune disease is causing me to wash my hands every time I touch a surface which I'm not sure is clean is almost killing me. Extreme overthinking of the same thought and lookint at it from various angles and the obsession with washing hands and checking doors is making me tired. 

On top of that, the dysgraphia has made my academics a funny failure. Can't get into a career without a masters and to do masters, one has to do well in their bachelors. And I can't write to save my own skin. Life is pretty fucked. I've thought of suicide for the past 8 months and these thoughts occur in a gap of a few hours. I don't think I'll have a good life at all. I had dreams but seeing the way life is going, I genuinely don't see a way out. And none of this is anyone's fault or probably someone's or probably mine for not asking for help or support. Whatever it is, it's irrelevant now. I wish I could die by terminal cancer or by rabies or sepsis. Idc I just want something to happen to me. I don't yet have the courage to do it myself but man I wish I die of pneumonia or something. It's not about my career or any specific thing. I don't want to continue life. I'm not enraged or ungrateful to my parents and people who love me (those people are basically 3in number), but I've had these thoughts occur to me that life for me is not worth living. It's just not worth it. Please have mercy on me Lord and take me. I can't live like this being the black sheep in every room that I go into. ",1

I will copy my full story from one of my previous posts. It's a little sensitive material but I hope it brings some clarity.

Tldr  the love of my life was sexually assaulted in a pub restroom and i didn't murder the bastard who did it because I didn't know how severe it was and also i was scared of someone much stronger and now I will never have a beautiful girlfriend 

  
From childhood, I was a selfish and cowardly person who, because of these two qualities, coupled with inexperience, down family and friends. I was beaten by my parents and offended at school, both by teachers and classmates, and I never knew how to answer. On the contrary, it began to seem to me that my bitter experience allows me to offend others, to take everything from life. I was very wrong, but definitely karma will bite me for this. My bad character and my grotesquely disgusting appearance (my left eye is lazy) led to the fact that I was fatally deprived of female attention and jealous of the men in my environment who drowned in it. Therefore, when on August 14, 2021, the most beautiful girl in my life, whom I had known for three years, invited me on a date herself, confessed her feelings to me and kissed me, I was the happiest person in the world. She was special. The most beautiful woman, dyed red hair and played rts videogames and watched anime, even let me touch her and seemed to want sex with me. However, in 48 hours everything turned upside down.
  
I witnessed the horrendous harassment of her on August 16th and did nothing. The rapist, our former friend, stood up and towered over her began to somehow strangely demand a kiss from her when we gathered for, as it seemed to me then, the most ordinary drinking party. I felt that she was not comfortable, but then I had no idea how bad everything was. I was too frightened by a physically stronger man to stand up for my beloved, especially since we had not officially dated yet. My God, I should have intervened already then!
  
The next morning, on August 17, I received a message that if I stood for her, she would have thought whether we should date or not, and since I did not see this, she does not see the point. I sobbed nine times after this message. I'm ready to cry over her right now
  too.
What I didn't know at the time was that shortly after the kiss-demanding incident, he followed her to the restroom and started molesting her. Very bad. I even continued to communicate with this bastard for some time, not knowing the whole story. I learned about the whole picture only a week later, when we met with her in the same company on other friends birthday party (but without the rapist). It was a very difficult conversation and I made a mistake in it, my stupid head. I said complete nonsense and selfishly tried to cling to any little thing, somehow trying to rehabilitate myself, but this only hurt my beloved more. When I tried to promise that I would behave differently if I had known the full story or next time, she started making fun of me. Fucking hell. I cut off all contacts with the assaulter that same evening I had learned the full story, and he was still surprised, he said, “Why does it bother  you? Fell in love with her? ”, To which I answered in the affirmative and sent the bastard to the Blocklist, after which, in the spring, I began to talk about his atrocities to the girls in our common institute. Although it hardly mattered, it was our last year at the university.
  
Somewhere in February, I blocked my beloved everywhere I could, because I realized that my feelings for her were not mutual and having her in my contact list, I only hurt myself. I hoped that I would forget it. Not at all. With a red-hot iron, her image is burned into my brain, heart, in my eyes. My mind is clouded, I feel disgust, shame, regret, depressive sadness, I want to cry forever. I thought that the gym and the study of foreign languages would somehow distract me from the manic desire to end a meaningless life in which I would never again touch the most beautiful and nicest woman on the planet. I began to hate my own sexuality and gladly would have self-castrated myself.

Even right now I pendulum from asexuality to wanting to fuck everyone, anyone at the first given chance. I wish this had never happened.

I want her back. More than anything in the world. I failed her. Now I have no one and nothing. My reputation is also ruined because she told everyone what happened. So now even if I wanted to find another girlfriend, I will never be able to because none would trust a coward such as myself.

It was my first time dealing with such situation and I just froze.

I wrote to my beloved and asked her forgiveness. She doesn't blame me, but when I said that I was ready to do everything for her safety for free, she said ""no, but thanks for the offer."" I wrote that I understand that she does not trust me, but suddenly yes, and that this is the first time in my life this has happened, to which she said that in any case I am glad that everything is fine with me and I wrote to her. I wrote her a paragraph that she gave me a lot of good emotions and this topic is difficult for me, and I want the best and make sure that everything is fine, she replied with one line ""have a nice day"" I wrote ""you too"" and deleted the chat.

I am very sad that she does not trust me and does not see me as a reliable person. She doesn't have to date me or anything, but her not trusting me hurts so much. Like a knife in the heart. I didn't do it on purpose, I panicked because it was the first time. It makes me cry and want to die so much. 

Even if at some point I wanted to settle for someone else (I will never be nearly as happy as with her), I won't be able to because she told everyone what happened and news in Baku spread like forest fire. 

He ruined my life. She was redhead and beautiful and thin. she has more energy than all other girls i know combined. Now antidepressants and porn killed my own male performance and I doubt I will ever have a normal romantic and sexual life. I have high prolactin and tsh.

He ruined my initiation in adulthood,my love and my life. I will be killing myself shortly because I cannot live in a world as s single person without my beautiful girl.",1

"I'm so tired. I've been 'sick' for the past 8 years, I have various food intolerances and leaky gut. That shit straight up sucks all energy out of me. There is no day were I feel truly fit or 'awake'. I'm 26 years old but I feel like I have been laying on my deathbed for almost a decade. There is so much that I want to do and experience. But my body acts as a prison. Each day feels like a struggle. I have many friends that are very supportive. Yet this does not take the burden off my shoulders. My body feels so heavy, I'm so tired. I don't know how much longer I can take this. And yet I'm too afraid to tell the people around me what I truly feel. What difference would it make? I don't want them to be stressed out because of me. I've been in therapy for the last maybe 5 years or so, which probably helped quite a bit in keeping me alive.

Im a virgin and lustfull for sex. I cant go to hooker i have std anxiety. I cant gave a gf im not good looking no money and cant commit to relationship right now. I dont want to use a girl only to have sex. 

Just let me die. I cant anymore. Im scared to become a monster. I cant do that to woman. 

I have a rope in my car. In case i cant hold this lustfull urge anymore.😔",1
"I'm tired. I completed HS, and university and now got a job after 6 months of unemployment. Yet, it feels like I'm never good enough. Got told off by my family, seeing that I was being a problem cause I didn't talk to people I refused to be friends with due to not favouring casual racism and comments on my body. I have to be on eggshells talking to coworkers unless I want to risk getting laid off from my first-ever job. My family doesn't give a shit about my undiagnosed mental conditions and just says 'See a professional' like it's a bandaid solution. If I could I would have years ago, but I'm broke asf. As soon as I show that I'm hurt they start to act all ""caring"". Fuck everyone and everything, who claimed to love me to only backstab me when it's convenient. I'm used to dealing with this shit growing up that it never fazed me, my mistake is being a fool thinking it would get better or things would change. I hope that one day when I go to work or any moment my life will be taken away. My life deserves to be taken from me the most than a child born with an incurable disease to be shortlived. Being an invisible person my whole life, I doubt I would be missed.

I did not lie and yet I am accused of lying (Our argument was just about her hearing the wrong number of my bank acc and she thinks Im the one who said it wrong. SEE HOW THIS PROBLEM NOT THAT SERIOUS? She threatened to hurt me again physically for defending myself and correcting her.)  now she wants me to travel everyday for 5 hours to go to college because I was disrespectful but I just defended myself. I am struggling to finish my schoolworks when I am staying near my college and now how am I suppose to finish them if I travel 5 hours per day tired and have 2 hours of sleep per day. If I fail any subjects I will lose my partial scholarship and I do think I will lose it if I do this. I think dying is an option now my brother finished his bachelor's last week after being a problem child who stopped school for years. And she acts like I did worse than ny brother everytime I try to defend myself.

"32F. I've attempted a few times in my life due to what I thought was clinical depression. Recently, lifechanging therapy helped me realize that I've had PTSD this whole time and was abused by my mother who probably has BPD.

Mentally I have been doing so much better, except that I deal with chronic disabling migraines and, for the past couple of years, stomach and digestive problems that have gotten so much worse. Lost my gallbladder too which has been horrible to live without.

Things are so seriously bad right now that I believe I have at least one ulcer (dx with erosive gastritis &amp; reactive gastropathy seemingly from bile reflux) a yr ago. It hurts to even move. I'm at a healthy weight (even slightly under), no alcohol, smoking, drugs, soda, or NSAIDs. Trying everything. Doctors just prescibe meds that make the problems worse or maybe even created them in the first place. This all started around the time I tried an anti-CGRP drug for migraine and had terrible side effects. 

My husband is largely great and helpful, but he can be so invalidating. He's a bit lizard-brained at times. He's admitted it and goes to therapy to work on all his issues, which I'm proud of him for doing and grateful for it.

But he just doesn't get it. He still - after all these years and all these horrible things that have happened to me - just kind of thinks I'm fine and is invalidating at times about my pain.

I feel so alone and not believed. I can't tell my parents because of my mother's BPD, and my brother will just ""tell on me"" to my parents if I try to confide in him.

I was just starting to love life and myself for the first time after I thought I would die from parental and friendship abuse and trauma and now I cannot physically feel well.

I wake up everyday with the feeling of a knife in my stomach. I have unbearable pain, diarrhea everyday, migraines, and extreme fear. I've tried so many doctors, treatments, etc. and I'm ready to give up. I have COVID now too and have for over a week and am terrified that it’s going to fuck me up even more.

I’d rather go on my own terms than wait around in agony for an ulcer to perforate my stomach. I’ve had enough pain.",1

"Prepare for a wall of text. Feel free to skip cuz it’s probably a waste of time.

I’m morbidly obese and might have type 2 diabetes. Last year my A1C was in the category of prediabetic; I’ve gained 50+ pounds since then and am uglier than ever, and now I’m worried that I have full fledged type 2. 

I can’t go get bloodwork because I’m scared shitless of insurance fraud. You see, a few weeks ago I told my eye doctor’s assistant that I vaped occasionally, and they labeled me as a smoker. I don’t know if vision insurance is separate from health insurance but now I’m worried that if I tell my doctor I stopped vaping (thus making me a non-smoker; I quit vaping cold-turkey two weeks ago) that the insurance company will think I’m lying for lower insurance premiums and think I’m trying to commit insurance fraud. 

Thus I’m avoiding my doctor. Thus I’m avoiding bloodwork. God forbid my PCP asks me if I smoke and the two answers contradict themselves; it would get me in a lot of trouble. I’m on my dad’s insurance and I don’t want him to get in trouble either for my stupid mistake. 

So now that I’m scared of having diabetes, I’m scared of eating. I just ate a small portion of sesame chicken with rice and I feel anxious and guilty over it. I immediately went to my room and started crying. I don’t want to be fat anymore. I look in the mirror at my hideous fat body and cry. I avoid mirrors as much as I can; I don’t take pictures of myself anymore. Surely I could lose some weight if I started exercising but I can barely muster the energy to get out of bed and brush my teeth or shower. I shower once a week and brush my teeth maybe twice per month. My meds aren’t working like they should; they feel like placebo pills anymore. 

So can’t get bloodwork done because I can’t tell my doctors the truth, thusly I can’t get results to see if I’m diabetic. Food terrifies me now and all I see is calories. I just ate so I’m probably done eating for the day; too much sugar and carbs. I’m sick and gross and ugly. I did this all to myself and I have no one to blame but me. 

I genuinely just want to stop all of this. Everytime I see cutlery in my kitchen I consider acting on my impulses. My mind never shuts off. I wake up in the middle of the night with my heart racing; I have a hard time sleeping more than four hours at a time. I hate my job that leaves me physically and mentally exhausted after every shift; I don’t work fast or efficiently enough so I expect I’ll be fired soon. 

My parents birthed a disappointment. I am a failure. My brain has failed me. My body has failed me. I am a waste of space and a fat, bulbous monstrosity. I just need this all to stop; it’s too much. ",1
I feel so pathetic. I was a straight a student but ever since puberty i have become so mentally ill. Im so dependant on everyone else and self sabotage anything thats not me staying in bed. I literally starved myself the first week of college bc i was dorming and couldn’t step out of my room without having an anxiety attack then proceeded to fail out bc of it. My brain is mush and i cant speak bc everything i say is stupid and dampens the mood. I hate how mentally ill i am. I misplaced my health insurance card and started spiraling. I thought maybe i would get a referral from my doctor but of course when i actually wanted to seek some help i cant. No money cant get a job. I feel stuck and all i hear is my mother’s disapproving voice in my head. If there was a gun in front of me i would not hesitate to pull the trigger.,1
"Hello, i hope this is not inappropriate to post. I never posted something on Reddit. I am really sorry, if this is not appropriate. 
I want to take my life tomorrow and since I have nobody to talk to, I thought I maybe just post here, just to talk to somebody. 
Sorry… happy to talk about anything… ",1
I'll off myself ,1
"Just as any sane person, I *tried* to hang myself a couple of days ago; I had the knot and everything, and all I needed to do was step off, but being the pussy I am, I just stood there for about 20 or so minutes then chickened out, but fucking hell, I still didn't feel a single thing. It should've been a big moment for me, right? But nope, I didn't even cry; it was like any other day. Heck, I've felt worse when cutting, so why not during that time? I just wanna feel something, for god's sake. Why do I have to be so fucking apathetic?",1
I have untreated but diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder and anxiety as well as clinical depression. Everyone i’ve ever cared for and loved has abandoned me. My boyfriend just broke up with me after 2 weeks of fights and I don’t think i can do this again. Ive been abandoned too many times and the pain is excruciating. I can’t eat or move or think about anything else. I love him so much and now hes gone too. I wish i could do better because all of this is my fault. Its always my fault because of my anger. Im so tired. Ive been SH-ing again and honestly i see no purpose anymore. Theres a lot more to it than just this. I might not get to see my 19th birthday. I might end it in a month. ,1
i am so sorry. i don't deserve to live anymore. i already have a plan in place and i don't want to bother anyone ever again. ,1
I’m starting palliative care but I feel like a burden. I’m in so much pain that I feel like my life isn’t worth living. It’s so lonely and I can’t talk to anyone about my suffering because it makes them uncomfortable. I’m ordering what I need to end things but it just makes me so sad.,1
"I’ve done everything the sources tell me to do. I tell my mom I’m suicidal. I try telling her again because nothing is helping. She says “what do you want me to do.” She has no compassion for me anymore. I tell my therapist. I go to therapy twice a week. I used to do dbt for 9 hours a week. I get a social worker. I get a job. I quit job. I get different job and quit that too. I take meds. I don’t take meds. I take more meds. I try even more meds. I write stuff down. I go to hospital. I make lists. I do everything. Why do I still feel so bad? Why am I so anxious every second of the day? Things aren’t getting better and I’ve been trying my hardest since I was a child. So please tell me when the fuck it’s supposed to get better. 

I look up resources all the time. What the fuck is supposed to help? Telling someone I’m having suicidal thoughts? They sent me involuntary to a mental hospital and put me on a hold for 3 days, not counting the weekends because apparently I stop existing on the weekends. And they punish me for acting autistic. I leave more suicidal than I came in. I have suicidal thoughts when I get reminded of having no power or autonomy. I am reluctant to say anything about my thoughts because I’m so fucking scared. Especially as a disabled person. It’s fucking terrifying.

I try to get the help but NOTHING IS WORKING AND ITS BEEN THIRTEEN YEARS. So tell me, what the fuck should I do? Because I have no idea. ",1
"When you’re at your worst is when you get shit on. I’m not even joking, look around and you’ll see it everywhere. 

It is rare to get ethical/moral/good treatment and usually then it’s by a special person or a decentralised organisation that has strong humanitarian values (e.g. charities etc).

The grossness of it all can be hard to bear.

My dog my best friend in the whole world passed away. He was only 9. He was the best boy. He had CHF so he was sick but I thought I’d have more years with him. I left him with my wife a year ago and I still saw him but I feel like I caused him to get sick and die. I wish I would’ve died instead of him. He brought so much to the world where I bring nothing. I wish I could’ve laid down next to him and never woken up. ,1
"I’m a 25F. I attempted to commit suicide yesterday by overdosing with a mix of anxiety medication and strong antibiotic. I felt so unwell and fainting I thought I was gonna die and I accepted the idea. I was taken to the hospital and as you can guessed, I survived. I was discharged from the hospital the day after. I spoke with mental health department and they thought I was fit to go back home.
Now I feel so confused, like the feeling I shouldn’t be here is stronger, like I couldn’t even do that one thing right. But I also feel I shouldn’t attempt again because it really hurt my partner’s feeling. 

Anyone else going through this?",1
"About 4 years ago (when I was 12) I started self harming and stopped that same year after I got therapy due to my parents finding out. It wasn’t a happy finding out though, I got thrown on the floor, almost kicked out of the house and repeatedly told to kill myself if I wanted to so badly. I still think about that incident daily and I wonder if I stopped self harming for myself or because I was just scared.

Self harm thoughts and suicidal thoughts have been creeping up on me lately and I don’t know what to do. I honestly don’t like my life, but I don’t think I can change it either and while self harming would possibly relieve me a bit it isn’t an option because I really don’t want to experience that again. 

I’m also extremely insecure and only about a year ago I was suffering from disordered eating. I would fast for 24 - 72 hours and would make myself throw up, but I also binged a lot so it wasn’t noticeable as I stayed the same weight. That has stopped since this year as I now eat like normal ,but my weight still gets to me and I still hate my body.

I’m too scared to ask my parents for a therapist (again) because when I had therapy my dad would complain that it is expensive and that would just make me feel really guilty. I really feel like just ending it sometimes.. I’m scared to grow up and I hate looking in the mirror everyday at something I don’t like.",1
so look I am 16 yr old boy and I am really struggling in life my parents basically divorced and he tried to in unalive her  and I got school pressure I feel If i dont focus i might fail and also I  would love to get a gf but I got rejected 3 times my ex gf or what I atleast thought so backstabbed me by talking behind my back and am struggling really to get a job because I want to help my mom and buy a iPhone but we broke af you might ask how broke are you am literally writing this from a mc Donald's internet cuz i cant afford i want to end my life please help from anyone ,1
"I’ve thought about killing myself since I was 8. I wouldn’t say i’ve had an overly horrible life, i’ve been bullied for most of my life but I had friends I guess. (Not true friends but they sufficed for the moment.)

Point is, i’m really depressed and have been planning my funeral and writing letters, giving away my stuff and being extremely nice and supportive towards others unknowingly preparing for my suicide but I haven’t done anything to finish the job. I’m only 16, I have a boyfriend who is really really great, I have good grades, my room is clean, I have a good friend, i’m pretty; so I just don’t understand why I feel like this now out of all times. I mean my life is great, am I just being dramatic teenager??
I’m so tired of living I just don’t know if I can do it anymore but I also love my life at the same time.",1
"So, I'm what you might call passively suicidal. Sure, I want to die, but I care so little I can't bring myself to care.  (Also, why won't this subreddit allow my phone to auto fill or spell check my entries? This alone makes me not even want to fucking finish this post. All other subreddits work... fuck).

Anyway typing here is so goddamn irritating Ill just day this and who cares aboiut readability, huh? I walked 5 miles today and i feel utterly miserable- why did I jusy utterly torture myself to extend this misrrable life? I dont feel acomplished, i feel like i wasted my time on utter bullshit, plus why be healthy, just die already",1
I've lived with constent trama back to back for years and all i want to do it end myself. Im going to attempt again ij the coming week and im not going to stop until i get results.,1
