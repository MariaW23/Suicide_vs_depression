###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,4,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2363,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2363,,False,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1572360722.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

I've been working in my field for 8ish years since I got out of the military. I've never really enjoyed it, but it pays bills.

,depression,"TRIGGER WARNING: body image issues, suicidal ideation

22(f) I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, and ADHD

I don't think I have ADHD just super obsessive thoughts about traumatic things that happened to me that distract me from daily tasks. 

I'm on Wellbutrin. I also smoke nicotine. I'm jobless. Never went to college. 

My day consists of eating and sleeping and mindlessly scrolling on social media. Brain rot. Laying down in bed. Eating more food, watching videos to ""change your life"" and ""becoming elevated."" 

This must be peak depression. I also just lost my job due to a manager harassing me, he fired me on the spot when I said he makes me uncomfortable. Probably because he was afraid of me telling his boss. There goes months of hard work to get that promotion. 

Also going through a break up of a 4 year long relationship after it got extremely toxic and I noticed myself feeling happier around friends. I felt more alone than ever while being with him. I started to despise him because I started feeling like his mother, everything he did  pissed me off. I don't think he's ever felt like that towards me. Which is why I felt guilty for leaving.

Got a new boyfriend without even processing the previous breakup. I then broke up with him over jokes he had made that made me feel way more insecure than I've ever felt.   
I still love this guy, I just hate myself for not being able to take a joke. He was quite literally too perfect for me, everything I had been looking for in a partner. I could not shake the thought that he's settling for me or I'm not his real type. Though he's never said that to my face, I can already tell by the way he interacts with other women- who even I - deem more attractive than me. Everything else about him was great, it's was those slick comments and small moments that stuck with me, confirming how ugly I am. 

I broke it off due to my self esteem being majorly low and that I'll only add depression into his life. He said I can depend on him, that he'd help, but I've been in this situation before. You do so much for someone to feel better, it's never gonna fulfill them until they love themselves. I'd only be searching for validation, I wouldn't be confident or secure. 

I'm having suicidal thoughts, everything I've done has lead to failure. I lost passion in my hobbies. I'm scared to start college at my age (22 about to be 23) I fear I'm too late.

I hate my body, it's the ugliest body I've ever seen. Who'd want to fuck this? Saggy tits, no ass, wrong proportions, fat, ugly face. No amount of surgery will help, nor do I have the money for it lmao. 

No one can love and accept my body except my ex of 4 years, but I dislike him. Do we see the hypocrisy here? 

Then I fell deeply into the topic of astrology, christianity, demons, God, creator of the universe, spirituality, crystals, witches, spell casting. I don't even know who or what to believe in anymore. Thus making me even more insecure and afraid. 

My friends (5 total) think I'm funny because of how dramatic I am. That's the only thing I have going for me is my outward performance to people will have a layer of humor and unseriousness.   
I started going to the gym and it helps, but some days it gets so bad I binge eat and don't move from my bed. I try to not eat so much, I can't help it. It's the only thing that comforts me right now. 

  
TLDR// My depression is getting the best of me and I overeat to feel better. Gaining weight. I started going to the gym, but I still eat like shit and don't even move at all sometimes. Any advice to build a routine that I can follow? I know everything I said can be labeled as ""excuses"" but it's so difficult for me to get out of this funk. Please help.

&lt;p&gt;22(f) I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, and ADHD&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t think I have ADHD just super obsessive thoughts about traumatic things that happened to me that distract me from daily tasks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on Wellbutrin. I also smoke nicotine. I&amp;#39;m jobless. Never went to college. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My day consists of eating and sleeping and mindlessly scrolling on social media. Brain rot. Laying down in bed. Eating more food, watching videos to &amp;quot;change your life&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;becoming elevated.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This must be peak depression. I also just lost my job due to a manager harassing me, he fired me on the spot when I said he makes me uncomfortable. Probably because he was afraid of me telling his boss. There goes months of hard work to get that promotion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also going through a break up of a 4 year long relationship after it got extremely toxic and I noticed myself feeling happier around friends. I felt more alone than ever while being with him. I started to despise him because I started feeling like his mother, everything he did  pissed me off.

I'm autistic, but high functioning, and I have suffered from depression and anxiety for years.  I feel so lost and out of place, and so incredibly lonely.

I feel shame at the thought of leaving family and the few friends I have, but also feel like I can't go on like this.  I've nothing left to give, and if I had the choice of flipping a switch, there's a very high chance I'd do it.  And I'm so scared of surviving an OD but fucking up my body.

I've kept that promise for more than 15 years, and I'm just tired of fighting.

I'm sorry. I've tried therapy and meds, but I just don't know what I can do.

with my stepdad gone, my mother has been even more unstable. when we went to visit him for the first time on saturday, my mother barely let me or my little brother speak to him. i gave my brother my phone so he wouldn’t be bored, which left me with nothing to do other than stare at the wall. my mom was very offended by my “embarrassing behavior”. long story short, yesterday, tuesday, she turned off my phone, called my grandfather and told him not to pay for my college education (i made it into my dream school and was supposed to be attending this fall—my entire life he has promised to cover the cost of attendance), forcefully took my drivers license, took my keys, and kicked me out of the house. i am not at my fathers without many of my usual toiletries or my emotional support dog.

The only friends I have are online and when I have tried to make friends in person, I always get ghosted or my anxiety gets too much and I end up cancelling on them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have decided against ever having children because of my illnesses and situation. I’m not pretty, I’m slightly overweight, constantly exhausted from being so anxious and I’m stuck in this loop forever. I have no way out. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I don’t even think anyone would care about this suicidal asian guy but I just had to say this somewhere. I have never had good relationships with others whether it’s family or friends.

,depression,"I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. Much of my life is spent alternating between passive acceptance of this and desperate attempts to fill it anyways. Sometimes it can be temporarily filled in good ways. Love helps. Compassion helps. My family, fiancée and dog help.

And yet the void remains. 

So I drink compulsively and I smoke too much because when I’m far enough gone I can forget I’m me. I do things I know are terrible for me. Because for just a little while the void is full, or at least I don’t notice its emptiness.

It’s a trap, of course. Numbing myself doesn’t help. Not really. Once I’m sober, I’m still me. Only, food tastes a little more like ashes in my mouth. Everything feels a more like I’m doing it wearing a weighted suit. I take even less joy from the good things in life. And I want another drink.

I don’t know why I’m like this. I’ve got some theories. Depression and substance abuse runs in the family. Childhood trauma possibly also plays a role. My first coherent memory is of a shooting I was in as a kid, with my mother grabbing me on her back to carry me away as quickly as possible. The sound of gunshots inside, the glare of the cheap mall lights. The dying boy bleeding out against a car. In any event, it probably didn’t help. 

I don’t think I want to die. It’s just hard to get worked up about going on living. That’s somewhat irrelevant. I’ve got people who need me. People who would be hurt if I left them. A dog that adores me. 

If I was alone in this universe I’d be free not to care if I live or die. But I’m not. So we continue. 

Because besides family, friends, pets…there’s her.

I love her in a way I hadn’t realized I was  capable of. And she loves me. She is sweet and kind and generous and good and she loves me.

Her life hasn’t been easy. She deserved better from the abusive family she doesn’t talk to anymore. She deserves better than me. But for some reason she wants me. For reasons beyond my comprehension she loves me. And I promised her a good life, with love and a real family and the adventures she never got growing up. So I’ll put in the work for her.

I will stop numbing the void and learn to accept it as part of me.

It’s going to be hard and I am afraid.

But it will be worth it. Because I love her and I want her to be happy. To be content. To take joy in life and leave it old and gray and with no regrets. And so I’ll do what I can to give that to her. I will quit drinking. I will give up smoking. I will wake up every day, and I will push through the emptiness and I will protect her and make her as happy as I can for as long as I can, for as long as she wants me. Sometimes I’ll be going through the motions of life. But I believe there will be moments that make me happy too. 

Or perhaps there won’t be. Not real happiness, of the kind I suspect I might have been capable of if I wasn’t…this. But if I can give her a joyful life lived without regrets, I will have done something worth doing with my life. And so I’ll focus on that. And the next time I want a drink, and every time after that, I’ll think about her and do my best to remind myself why I can’t.

I expect to always be depressed. But I think I can create space to exist within it, to make my peace with it. I can choose to feel the pain instead of numbing myself to it. And I will. My life is worth living and has a point because I say so. No matter how hard and scary that might be. 

If some of this is striking a cord with anyone reading it, I hope you find your reason to do your best. Maybe you’ll find a route to happiness through it. Hell, maybe I will. But even if not, there are still things worth doing with life. Hang in there and good luck.

If all my friends family and peers never tormented me my whole life that im fat ugly and useless maybe id have a better life and a reason to be happy. Im just so tired. I’ll never be pretty enough or smart enough or hot enough. I’ll never be enough. They even yelled at me about attempting suicide 4 years ago. They yelled at me about cutting when they found out. Instead of getting me help they decided to berate and torment me. I’ll just never be good enough in anyone’s eyes. No matter how hard I try. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"**Need To Talk / Vent**

Throwaway account. I need to express what I'm going through because I'm exhausted from living like this without anyone truly understanding. My mind is essentially in a permanently blank, withdrawn, depersonalised and dissociative slate, as if I'm watching my life as a movie, drifting through it on autopilot. Everything and everyone around me feels lifeless and foggy. I feel completely detached from my body and surroundings, as if I'm not really alive. It's hard to explain, but everything feels disconnected and distant. It's like living in a permanent state of amnesia, where I'm detached from my own body, lacking thoughts, memories, or a sense of identity like some sort of ego death that never ends. This has severely impacted my social abilities; I have nothing to say or express anymore. I feel numb, empty, and permanently withdrawn. Trying to have a simple conversation with me is like trying to get blood from a stone. I feel utterly hopeless, constantly sad, and sometimes, it feels like I'm not real.

I became very depressed about a year ago, and my cognitive abilities just dwindled overtime. I started just staying in my room all the time, sleeping and doing nothing else, and my memories started to decline, and my brain was probably not being stimulated or processing much information as it should. I feel crazy writing this. I feel completely alone, withdrawn and there's just nothing going on inside of my head anymore. Am I going crazy? Am I going I mentally insane? It took me a long time come up this post because my situation is so complicated, bizarre, and difficult to explain. I've done my best to express how I feel.

I feel completely hopeless and unable to explain my situation to medical professionals. When I try, I just sit in silence, unable to convey my problems because I'm literally zoned out of myself. I have nothing to say or express, and my mind is just empty because I'm entirely withdrawn from myself.

**Time at College**

I have fortunately been doing well at college and have been studying hard, but I can't explain anything about what I do there because I'm permanently zoned out and withdrawn the entire time I'm on campus. I am in a constant dream-like state and don't really think about anything. I don't take in or process much information while at college; I only learn when I get home and view the slides and take study notes. I do not converse or speak with others at all. I stay by myself at all times and avoid any social interaction. I am incapable of having basic conversations because absolutely nothing is happening in my mind. I have nothing to say or express, and trying to find something to say is very difficult. I can't make an effort to find something to say because my mind is an empty void.

,depression,"i’m an upcoming senior. I have my last opportunity to take the SAT and get a decent score in a month. I have college applications to start. I have to find colleges and recommendations. 

I can’t bring myself to do what i want to do though.

I was diagnosed with moderate depression and GAD (general anxiety disorder) about a year ago. I went on Fluoxetine for about a week and then stopped. I was supposed to stay on it for a few months and go up in potency depending on how i felt but i ran out and since the pharmacist didn’t have the refills i just stopped.  

I used to think that my doctor was over exaggerating my symptoms and i didn’t have “moderate depression”. But i realized the medicine did help a few weeks later when i no longer felt the effects of it. But i didn’t think it was important enough to get more. Probably a bad idea.

Anyways, i used to study for the SAT like a maniac. Seriously. And i improved well but you know what they say about how the higher your score goes the harder it is to improve. Maybe it’s not as difficult and I’m just making it seem like it is to make more excuses for myself. Went from PSAT 1130 average to a 1350. Ik it’s not as great as some people but it’s something. 

My first SAT i got a 1340 and then bs’ed my way for a couple months swearing “doing my best studying” when me and my entire family knew i wasn’t. It went up 10 points and i lost the meager energy i had left to study. 

Nowadays, i spend my time lazing around with nothing better to do. I sleep at terrible hours, wake up nearing the evening and do nothing but eat, nap, and scroll on my phone for entertainment. Don’t shower for days. Avoid meeting people. I tell myself i need to study since my last exam is coming up. 

I know that with a higher score i could get a better scholarship and save tons of money for my parents considering tuition. I want that. I don’t want to make them pay for an expensive college all out of pocket because they are determined to not take out loans or let me work a job whilst pursuing higher education.

I love my parents. With everything i have. But no matter how much my older brother tells me i have to care about my future and focus and study- I fail myself.  He’s doing it out of worry and precaution for me because he knows i won’t think about it for a second if nobody reminded me to actually put my mind to action. 

But i’m so so ashamed and guilty for how i constantly let them down. Everytime i sit down and try to put my plans to action, i half-ass it and know it won’t account for anything.

I’m not particularly suicidal or anything but i do have intrusive thoughts (which im pretty confident everyone has in their lifetime). But i think perhaps one of the reasons im so unprepared for my future is because i for some reason always assumed that i’d die due to some sort of accident or illness (not sure why, it’s just been like that) before i had to make such decisions. 

I have thoughts that go such as:

Someone: “(Name) you have to think about where you’d like to go to college”

*It’s not like i’ll live to go anyway*

Someone: “College is a big thing in your life and you’ll never get that part of your life back”

 *We’re kind of all just specks on a rock in outer space i don’t think it matters that much what i do in life*

^^Basically stuff like that. I don’t intend to kill myself or self harm in any sort of ways so i don’t exactly understand the deal with thinking i’ll die super well. In fact i look forward to the idea of marrying someone i love and having a great family with them. That is, if i find someone who’ll love me enough to want to marry me.

I’m thinking of asking my dad to get me an appointment or whatever it is that i need to do to get back on the medication in hopes it’ll make me happy enough to enjoy the idea of putting in the work to study and purse a better score with all the benefits?

Sometimes the shame and guilt eats me alive so much that it chips away at me in random times of the day. Sometimes all i can do to force myself to sleep to avoid the pain it’s giving me. Sometimes i just want to cry for the rest of my day. Or sometimes i just don’t care enough to think about it again. I’ll tell you what, the later is **quite** rare.

&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, i spend my time lazing around with nothing better to do. I sleep at terrible hours, wake up nearing the evening and do nothing but eat, nap, and scroll on my phone for entertainment. Don’t shower for days. Avoid meeting people. I tell myself i need to study since my last exam is coming up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that with a higher score i could get a better scholarship and save tons of money for my parents considering tuition. I want that. I don’t want to make them pay for an expensive college all out of pocket because they are determined to not take out loans or let me work a job whilst pursuing higher education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love my parents. With everything i have. But no matter how much my older brother tells me i have to care about my future and focus and study- I fail myself.  He’s doing it out of worry and precaution for me because he knows i won’t think about it for a second if nobody reminded me to actually put my mind to action. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But i’m so so ashamed and guilty for how i constantly let them down. Everytime i sit down and try to put my plans to action, i half-ass it and know it won’t account for anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not particularly suicidal or anything but i do have intrusive thoughts (which im pretty confident everyone has in their lifetime). But i think perhaps one of the reasons im so unprepared for my future is because i for some reason always assumed that i’d die due to some sort of accident or illness (not sure why, it’s just been like that) before i had to make such decisions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have thoughts that go such as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone: “(Name) you have to think about where you’d like to go to college”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not like i’ll live to go anyway&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone: “College is a big thing in your life and you’ll never get that part of your life back”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’re kind of all just specks on a rock in outer space i don’t think it matters that much what i do in life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Basically&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; stuff like that. I don’t intend to kill myself or self harm in any sort of ways so i don’t exactly understand the deal with thinking i’ll die super well. In fact i look forward to the idea of marrying someone i love and having a great family with them. That is, if i find someone who’ll love me enough to want to marry me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m thinking of asking my dad to get me an appointment or whatever it is that i need to do to get back on the medication in hopes it’ll make me happy enough to enjoy the idea of putting in the work to study and purse a better score with all the benefits?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the shame and guilt eats me alive so much that it chips away at me in random times of the day. Sometimes all i can do to force myself to sleep to avoid the pain it’s giving me. Sometimes i just want to cry for the rest of my day. Or sometimes i just don’t care enough to think about it again. I’ll tell you what, the later is &lt;strong&gt;quite&lt;/strong&gt; rare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This seems like a vent, but i genuinely do want advice.&lt;/p&gt;

hobbies are rarely fun, it's like out of 100 days of reading there would be 1 day where I'd actually fully enjoy it. I'm constantly bored, even art doesn't seem fun.

 I can't feel happy with people most of the time, I thought going out would help. I do crave people, but when I get the opportunity to be with them it doesn't feel special,or good as I was expecting it would. I yearn for company all for nothing 

i was wrong ,it didn't. I was miserable while everyone was taking pictures, I was contemplating how many bones I'd break if I jump from the 2nd floor of the restaurant or repeatedly banging my head against the wall.
It was a  nice restaurant, I liked the food, everyone else was having fun. I wasn't, it showed even in the group pictures I was in.

I have no ""gusto(?)"" for anything. it's like ""ok, this thing feels nice."" but there's nothing special about it. I could watch some memes and that will feel as exciting as doing my interest which I'm supposed to enjoy. 


I get jealous of people who genuinely love their hobbies, you can always see their eyes twinkling and face becoming excited. they look so full with life. 


I on the other hand, am always so monotonous, not only does it bother me it also bothers my sister who wants to have fun with me. 

I feel bad for being this way, I know I shouldn't compare but like my life isn't that bad. sure I didn't have some things but I feel like shit for being sad when my own sister has 100x much worse than me.

I'd really like to be able to prolong this to see how far I can go and if I can heal from all this so that I can build a better life together with the one I love.

I spent 9 years away from my cousins and when I saw them again a few days ago, I saw how much they had evolved with their lives and I was completely saddened, distressed and without expectations, one of my cousins is already getting married and building her family, the other is already working with what she likes and will probably find someone who loves her too.

As for me, how can I put it? Things aren't going so well, you know? Haha... I've been waiting for something good to happen to me for seven years, but I'm not getting my hopes up.

I feel like I'm being pushed to the edge of an abyss. Depression has destroyed everything I had left, the only good memories have become remnants, a figure in the fog of my memories,  

So I decided to make an album and take some photos to remind me of some landscapes and moments that were somewhat comforting for a while, even if they only mean something to me, I would like to revisit these photos in the near future before I leave, at least to remember my old self

,depression,"Hello (14M), growing up as a child who has adhd and living in an unsafe environment with plenty of kids, even adults making fun of me. Here, my abusive and alcoholic dad who physically abused me because of my disabilities has ruined my brain permanently.

He went to rehab for 2 years back in 2020... When he got back i thought it was over now... Till he cheated on my mom... And when she found out... She confronted her...

They fought... Infront of me... We were eating dinner that time... They don't even know i was there... It's just screaming and yelling... As i eat...

They didn't get a divorce... Instead they just lived in our house without talking to each other... Some other fights along the way...

They eventually sort it out and decided to live in a much safer area... I was extremely happy that time when i heard that I'll be leaving the place I almost died on...

When we moved... I made plenty of friends along the way and even went in a band... I hit puberty there... It was good... The place is quiet... It's a safe place for me... if only I can live there for the rest of my life... I can't tho...

2 years had passed, 2024. Turns out that my parents are going to sell the house and we need to go back from that shitty place I used to live on...

My whole world shattered... My stomach dropped... All the healing I did... Gone in a blink of an eye... I begged for them not to do it but they did... I wished it was dream... My friends... My school... My home... They took it away from me...

When we got back to our house... I get frequent flashbacks from the past... It felt so uncomfortable... It felt... Scary... I can't believe I'm back here... Even the school i transferred to... It's haunted... I'm scared of what's going to happen to me here...

Present day, i don't go out anymore... I drown myself on caffeine... Like energy drinks and coffee... I only go out when I have to... Like school, buying stuff from the grocery... I sometimes wish i was dead already and if i should just end it all... I think I'm doing a pretty good job of doing things that could kill me... Like drinking as much energy drinks asi can... not sleeping for 3 days... sleeping in the bathroom... but these doesn't do its job... I'm still fine... 

I go and tried to change the look of my room... And threw out the things that reminded me of the past... But I still get it... My mind is going crazy... This is torture for me... The only way I can interact to my friends is through online...i really miss them... I cry almost every night... It's my 5th month here... 

I got myself my first girlfriend... But that didn't end well and I just got mad at her suddenly and started calling her names and other hurtful stuff... I regret doing that... I didn't know why I even did that... I just came out of me... We only got together for 2 months and my unstable sense of self has led me to push her away... And regret it 3 hrs after when it's too late...

I failed almost every of my class but still manage to be able to go through the next school year... Next week I will be in 10th grade now...

I'm aching just to feel like home... Back to where i belong... I didn't know that... Happiness is temporary... But you can't force yourself to be happy... You have to find what makes you happy... But I can't...

&lt;p&gt;They fought... Infront of me... We were eating dinner that time... They don&amp;#39;t even know i was there... It&amp;#39;s just screaming and yelling... As i eat...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They didn&amp;#39;t get a divorce... Instead they just lived in our house without talking to each other... Some other fights along the way...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They eventually sort it out and decided to live in a much safer area... I was extremely happy that time when i heard that I&amp;#39;ll be leaving the place I almost died on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we moved... I made plenty of friends along the way and even went in a band... I hit puberty there... It was good... The place is quiet... It&amp;#39;s a safe place for me... if only I can live there for the rest of my life... I can&amp;#39;t tho...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 years had passed, 2024. Turns out that my parents are going to sell the house and we need to go back from that shitty place I used to live on...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My whole world shattered... My stomach dropped... All the healing I did... Gone in a blink of an eye... I begged for them not to do it but they did... I wished it was dream... My friends... My school... My home... They took it away from me...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we got back to our house... I get frequent flashbacks from the past... It felt so uncomfortable... It felt... Scary... I can&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m back here... Even the school i transferred to... It&amp;#39;s haunted... I&amp;#39;m scared of what&amp;#39;s going to happen to me here...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Present day, i don&amp;#39;t go out anymore... I drown myself on caffeine... Like energy drinks and coffee... I only go out when I have to... Like school, buying stuff from the grocery... I sometimes wish i was dead already and if i should just end it all... I think I&amp;#39;m doing a pretty good job of doing things that could kill me... Like drinking as much energy drinks asi can... not sleeping for 3 days... sleeping in the bathroom... but these doesn&amp;#39;t do its job... I&amp;#39;m still fine... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I go and tried to change the look of my room... And threw out the things that reminded me of the past... But I still get it... My mind is going crazy... This is torture for me... The only way I can interact to my friends is through online...i really miss them... I cry almost every night... It&amp;#39;s my 5th month here... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got myself my first girlfriend... But that didn&amp;#39;t end well and I just got mad at her suddenly and started calling her names and other hurtful stuff... I regret doing that... I didn&amp;#39;t know why I even did that... I just came out of me... We only got together for 2 months and my unstable sense of self has led me to push her away... And regret it 3 hrs after when it&amp;#39;s too late...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I failed almost every of my class but still manage to be able to go through the next school year... Next week I will be in 10th grade now...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m aching just to feel like home... Back to where i belong... I didn&amp;#39;t know that... Happiness is temporary... But you can&amp;#39;t force yourself to be happy... You have to find what makes you happy... But I can&amp;#39;t... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing this got a lot out of my chest... &lt;/p&gt;

I suck at every game I've ever bought or pirated. It's not just the competitive shooters, but just about every game. I suck at every hobby I have. I want to be a writer and future author, but my writing skills are subpar to every and all published and unpublished author; I cannot read a fucking book even if my life depended on it. Why? Inattentiveness. ADHD-ridden brain. I cannot focus on any one thing at a time without feeling exhausted or bored.  
I suck at the classes I have in university. I am not the best student, or amongst the top. Fucking Christ, I am still studying in the same university for FOUR FUCKING YEARS and I just barely completed 25% of the program. KILL ME ALREADY. I suck at every single fucking social interaction I have. I'm friends with nobody, and when I'm partially allowed to exist within a friend circle, I'll be the wall nobody wants to speak to.

I suck at drawing, I suck a writing, I suck at gaming, I suck at socializing, I suck at learning, I suck at speaking, I suck at everything I do. I cannot even lose weight even if I wanted to. I decrease the food intake, increase water consumption, and yet I'm still as fat as I was years ago. Yeah, I'm not obese, but any kilogram above the ideal lean body is a death sentence if you want to have a partner.  
Oh, yeah, I also have no gf. Why would I? Other depressive people are depressed but HAVE WORTH. Other people may have ADHD, but they get super creative endeavours that make them desirable. What am I? A waste. Useless.

I guess when I was bullied and told I was mentally retarded, those bullies were right. I am mentally retarded.

I have not a single thing I'm good at. I don't mean ""the best amongst my peers"", but ""good enough that I'm happy with myself"". No.

Maybe, then, it is imperative to kill myself and avoid any further humiliation. When you're young, you're full of potential (or so people think of you); always at the brim to explode with a million creative ideas, and distil one or two into productive, long-life goals that will catapult you into a proper, deserving, well-lived life. But once you hit a certain age, around your early to mid 20s, people will wonder where is your potential.

Oh, you don't have potential. You're too broken to have potential. You are useless.

So I think to myself, this is enough. I want to die with dignity, both to myself and for others. I want to die early so I stop this ongoing humiliation of being utterly useless at everything I can or could do. I'll never be a good writer and author, I'll never be a good artist, I'll never finish my degree, I'll never be good at any game, I'll never have a girlfriend who loves me, I'll never be happy.

People, this is not a depression-rushed conclusion to my problems, but a natural outcome of a life full of failures. A man has only so much he can endure, and if I do not see any improvement whatsoever after being alive for 23 years, then I can safely and accurately conclude that this life is not worth continuing.

,depression,"i met my now bsf about two months ago on the internet. he's a great friend &amp; has helped me in many ways. i genuinely enjoy talking to him. the thing is, he broke up with his ex about 6 months ago &amp; he's been crazy depressed &amp; suicidal since then. a little after we met, he started falling for me. so did i. he started showing signs of getting better. but it worsened when i told him i was atheist &amp; since he's a theist, there was no way we could ever end up together. then he was back to being depressed. 

everyday we talk about anything &amp; everything. all the time. from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed. some days he's really really depressed &amp; fsr i feel like i'm obliged to do anything &amp; everything in my power to make him happy. even if it doesn't work, i still do everything. i don't like leaving him to himself bc ik he'll start overthinking &amp; be sad again. 

he's my best friend &amp; it hurts so bad to see him this way. he doesn't deserve this &amp; i always feel like it's my responsibility to make sure he's not sad. he has an emo posting account on ig where he sometimes make posts saying he misses ""them"" &amp; it hurts so bad especially bc he's clearly in love with me. it makes me feel like he's using me to get over her. sometimes i wish for her to just come back to him, apologize &amp; take him back. i did kind of confront him about this but he assured me that he would never use me like that &amp; that he just misses being happy. but idk man. i try to ignore the posts on that account of his but they pop up on my feed &amp; with every post i feel a knife twist &amp; turn inside me. everytime i see that he's posted something sad on that account, i get so so anxious to check it out. sometimes i get close to tears seeing the shit he posts there. whenever he mentions his ex, i get so fucking anxious, i have to put my phone away for a while &amp; then come back.

i do everything i can to make him feel better but nothing works. he's so precious to me &amp; i just want him to be happy. i'm really boring &amp; unfunny but he still talks to me about anything.

he sometimes send me pictures of his online girl bsf whom he loves like a sister &amp; says stuff like ""she's so pretty i love her"" &amp; it's true. she really is pretty. she's gorgeous. everytime he sends me her picture, i can't help but zoom in &amp; admire her. she makes me feel so ugly &amp; insecure. everytime he sends me her picture i get so anxious bc ik he'll say something like he loves her or that she's so pretty &amp; idk why. sometimes i wonder if he does the same to my pictures with her but i doubt it. a few weeks ago i was crying bc i felt like i would never be pretty enough for him. i went to our chats &amp; pulled up pictures of her &amp; started crying even harder. i felt so insecure.

the thing is. i rarely ever cry. but these past two months i have cried about 3-4 times. i just got done crying for 40 minutes. i was even clean from self harm for almost two years &amp; i relapsed like last month. i've self harmed twice till then. i even had the urge to do it rn but i didn't. 

i just want him to be happy. even if it's without me. sometimes i feel like he doesn't love me &amp; it hurts. i'm very cautious while talking to him bc i don't want to say anything that'll remind him of his ex or make him sad. i don't tell him when i'm sad bc i don't want to add onto his depression. but he tells me everything. he shares a lot with me &amp; trusts me so much. we'll meet irl next year bc we'll go to the same university. who knows what'll happen till then. it's been like a week since our chats have been dry, bc he's sad &amp; i have no clue how to make him feel better. i have nothing to talk about. even if i do, his replies are short &amp; he seems uninterested. ik that's not the case &amp; he's just too sad to talk. &amp; that hurts. knowing i can do nothing to help. i've kind of accepted that i can't help him &amp; it hurts. i don't know what to do. i just want him happy. i feel so emotionally drained. he doesn't know any of this.

I don’t understand what’s actually wrong with me, no one likes me and I’m so alone not even my own parents. They scream and get physical with me whenever I do one thing wrong but my other siblings don’t get that.

Im the second youngest, I have 3 older brothers, 3 older sisters and one younger brother and I feel like my parents gave up on me but when my younger brother came along it’s like they had this re start and wanted to be parents again but only to him. My older siblings are all moved out and have families of their own and it’s only me and my brother at home. He’s only 4 years younger than me and my parents love him to bits. 

When they found out he was being bullied they went to the school and did all they could for him. They even got him a therapist. But when I was getting bullied they did nothing. When I said I wanted a therapist they laughed and told me I didn’t need one. When they found out about my sh they got mad and screamed at me and told my whole family even my younger brother who laughs at me and says “shut up you lit cvt yourself” 

I hate it. I hate everything but I can’t bring myself to hate them.

Not even my own boyfriend likes me, he leaves for hours and hours and he fights with me everyday. He broke up with me on our 5 month anniversary and it broke me. He didn’t love me anymore but he came back a month later saying he missed me and when we got back together it was like he didn’t care. He doesn’t notice when I’m upset or when I’m annoyed, but I love him so much and I know he doesn’t love anymore

I get told by my parents and everyone in my family how weird and stupid I am. I have dyslexia and stuff but that doesn’t even matter to them. I hate seeing my friends parents do whatever they can for them while I’m stuck being lonely having no one to talk to. I know that no one can love me and I know how un loveable I really am. But I hope one day maybe someone will tell me how much they love me and how much I mean to them and maybe even might be scared of losing me. But even then I’m being stupid.

,depression,"Just kind of feeling the need to vent here... I don't really feel any motivation anymore. I'm 31M. Have an okay job but am by no means wealthy. I have savings but can't afford a house and probably never will be able to. I've never been in a relationship and am starting to accept that I probably never will be in love. I don't really feel motivation towards anything in my life anymore. I go to work, am generally bored by my job and sit there for 8 hours waiting to go home most days.

I then get home, have no real motivation to do anything, and effectively sit there waiting to go back to work the following day.

I think that I've been depressed on some level for about 75% of my life, or at least since I was a teenager. Most of the time i've felt that some change in my life would make things better... ""When I get the new job I'll feel better."" or ""When I move I'll feel better."" or ""When I find a girlfriend I'll feel better.""

I'm starting to realize that none of those things ever really change anything. I recently got a new job, moved to a new city. I thought I would feel much better. I don't. There's almost always been some light at the tunnel that I convinced myself would make me feel better, but I've realized that my depression never goes away. I'm genuinely unsure if I'm capable of sustained happiness.

Even if I felt there was another light at the end of the tunnel/carrot on a stick to chase, I think its unlikely that my life will improve much from here. I don't think wealth or relationships are really in the cards for me. My life will likely continue to be a cycle of working a boring 9-5 and coming home to a boring/lonely apartment.

On top of those feelings, the world itself is so bleak to me. I feel that as a civilization and species, we're hopeless. I think we've reached a point where technological advances are actually a net negative for human happiness/fulfillment, but those advances are impossible to stop or reverse. Politically, I think the US is completely fucked. Both parties are corrupt and on some level or another just serving the interests of the ultra rich and elite at the expense of the 99%. I don't think that these problems are fixable either. The elites have managed to create alignment with the poor. Your 401ks are tied to the value of their companies. Your home valuation is skyrocketing because their corporations are buying up single-family homes across the country. If you want your bread crumb, you better hope they get their feast.

I just find life so depressing both on a personal level and when I look at society as a whole. I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately but I refuse to kill myself while my mom is alive because it would completely destroy her and thats about the only thing I care about anymore...

,depression,"Last 10 years I felt like I'm skipping on everything in life. My young years is so... I don't know how to even say this... Painful.

I don't want to die. I want to live. From what I can see life can be beautiful... Just not mine. 

First I was incredibly shy. With time I managed to overcome it but then COVID hit. This will sound bad but I gotta be honest. 2020 was the best year for me in the last ten years. I found my first good job, got masters in physics, spend a bunch of time with my friends playing games. It was fun.

Then something majorly changed. Every new day I felt like death is coming and I couldn't understand what it is. I ignored it for about a year until it got so so bad. I couldn't sleep, not a one single good or positive though visited my brain. Level of tiredness was way to high to do basic tasks on the job. I decided to go to psychiatrist since I understood that something was very wrong.

Long story short I got diagnosed with GAD or generalized anxiety disorder. 2 years of treatment and it got a bit better to the point that doctors allowed to stop taking meds. I've felt fine for the first time in 3 years, but obviously those 3 years I was absent from normal life. At that moment I felt like I'm missing something. No relationship, no strength to pursue it, no desire to chase it.

Then happened something way worse than I could imagined. War in my country. It's not a political post so I won't talk it from the point of politics. My mental declined with massive speed, to the point that I've felt again that fear of death on a whole new scale. I knew that I could be drafted at any moment and with my health problems (stomach and spine problems) I knew I will not survive on the battlefield.

Now it's 3 years of war. This whole time I see funerals of young and old, men, women and most scary - children. I don't remember who said war is hell but that person was right. I never ever would wish something like this even to my worst enemy. Too bad my worst enemy happy that this is happening.

Now I'm looking at my life with understanding that even not on the battlefield I can die at any moment. And question myself ""what my life even was for?"". I have no family, kind, woman I love, solid salary, my own home or something to go towards. Some of my friends are dead or badly wounded. If I parishes right now, what did I even left? 

This post is not about asking for help, politics or something like that. This is just something I needed to get of my chest.

I don't know my future. I know my past. I know myself. And I don't like what I am. 

Maybe I will have a chance to send invites to my best friends for my wedding one day. Maybe I will see my kids being brought to life. Maybe I will be able just to enjoy life with someone I love.

My young years is so... I don&amp;#39;t know how to even say this... Painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to die. I want to live. From what I can see life can be beautiful... Just not mine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First I was incredibly shy. With time I managed to overcome it but then COVID hit. This will sound bad but I gotta be honest. 2020 was the best year for me in the last ten years. I found my first good job, got masters in physics, spend a bunch of time with my friends playing games. It was fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then something majorly changed. Every new day I felt like death is coming and I couldn&amp;#39;t understand what it is. I ignored it for about a year until it got so so bad. I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep, not a one single good or positive though visited my brain. Level of tiredness was way to high to do basic tasks on the job. I decided to go to psychiatrist since I understood that something was very wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long story short I got diagnosed with GAD or generalized anxiety disorder. 2 years of treatment and it got a bit better to the point that doctors allowed to stop taking meds. I&amp;#39;ve felt fine for the first time in 3 years, but obviously those 3 years I was absent from normal life. At that moment I felt like I&amp;#39;m missing something. No relationship, no strength to pursue it, no desire to chase it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then happened something way worse than I could imagined. War in my country. It&amp;#39;s not a political post so I won&amp;#39;t talk it from the point of politics. My mental declined with massive speed, to the point that I&amp;#39;ve felt again that fear of death on a whole new scale. I knew that I could be drafted at any moment and with my health problems (stomach and spine problems) I knew I will not survive on the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now it&amp;#39;s 3 years of war. This whole time I see funerals of young and old, men, women and most scary - children.

I'm sure most people feel that way.

Each day feels like I'm putting on a mask. 

I overthink too much, I drink too much, I sleep too much, I worry too much, I smoke too much, I talk too much, I'm too needy, I need too much attention, I **AM** too much. Thats what anyone I talked to ever told me.

I feel genuinely happy that I'll move in with my boyfriend soon, and we're picking up our little kitten on saturday. I'll go to school again after having finished training. I have a roof over my head. I have food.

I feel pathetic for every feeling that I have. Im stressed about exams? Why? I'm ""smart"" according to former colleagues and my partner... I dont deserve to feel stressed or anxious.

I have healthy coping mechanisms? But why need them? Other people might think they're weird. Other people have it worse. Others cope better.

I also experienced pretty bad hyperacusis that lasted for a week whilst strongest for two days and then gradually dissapearing. Thank god it did not cause more tinnitus.

Do you think the serotinine syndrom could cause hyperacusis?

&lt;p&gt;I’m in my rumination era. All my ‘no’s have caught up to me, I spend most of my time by myself because of them. The loneliness is so big. I spend most of my time physically and mentally motionless because the feeling (or lack thereof) takes up all my open spaces. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do you all deal with loneliness? Do you feel isolated by your depression and anxiety? Is there a way to move through, or away from, all of it and build a life again? I don’t often ask for advice, but I guess I’m in my “please help” era too. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of love to all going through it. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Sorry in advance, as I’m not sure exactly what my goal is with this post. Idk if I’m even posting in the right sub. I guess I just need to get this off my chest, so thank you in advance for reading and listening. 

Been taking Zops pretty consistently now at nighttime for the past few years. Sometimes I go a few nights without, but always end up falling back on it. Always take between 5mg-7.5mg- sometimes, very rarely, I’ll take a 10mg. But never more than that per night. I buy it online with crypto, which I know is risky but at this point in my life, I just don’t care. 

I take Zop, not so much for the sleeping benefit (although that is admittedly a great feature of it) but because it sedates my mind, and my thoughts. It numbs my hurt. It just allows my brain to be quiet and slip into unconsciousness, quietly. All this, I yearn for on a daily basis. 

I acknowledge that gradually, I’m disintegrating. I wonder if it’s because of the Zopiclone… but I’ve felt so terrible for so long (far, far before I ever started taking it), that I have my doubts. I’ve been sad for a long time. Maybe this is how I would be, Zopiclone or not. 

As it is, these days I feel like I am permanently encapsulated within a thick, dark fog. My mind is slow and languid. My speech is slow and slurred. I am tired; so, so agonisingly- yet blissfully- tired, every second of the day. My body feels like a lead weight. My limbs ache, despite doing nothing. 

Caffeine does not rouse me from this concious, coherent daily stupor. Nothing rouses me. I feel so numb. Food is an inconvenience that I can hardly ever be bothered with.

My mind and thoughts race throughout the day. And yet, I can’t make my body or brain actually do anything. The constant, dull ache behind my eyes is now almost a background sensation to me. 

Nothing seems or feels good to me anymore. Everything either feels like massive stress, or like nothing at all. Joy is a foreign concept that I have not experienced for a long, long time now.  I desperately look for anything and anyone else to blame for “making me this way”, all the while I don’t even attempt to take the necessary steps to help myself. I just don’t have the energy, or the strength, or the intellect. I feel as though I possess a grand total of 3 whole brain cells.

Idk if this is because of the Zops, or just because of depression or something. But it feels like, at the end of each thick, fog-filled day, when I’m exhausted from the mental fight of it all, and ashamed of how inept I am at life, Zopiclone and the Zop-sleep is the only thing that temporarily relieves me from my flat, grey, overcast existence. 

I just want to add that I’m not suicidal or anything (tbh I’m far too lazy and tired to bother). Has anyone read “I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream” by Harlan Ellinson? I just feel like the amorphous blob-guy at the end of the story; unable to live, and unable to die. Just… there. Existing.

,depression,"I am currently on vacation out of school. This past month, I have been feeling suffocated with myself and my thoughts and don't know how to overcome it. I barely have any friends and we don't even talk that much, although I have someone whom I consider as a friend and we talk through the internet, I just still somehow feel so alone and just don't feel any warmth and love from anyone.

I feel so ridiculous and useless when it comes to household chores. The only long conversation that I had with my mom was her yelling at me because I just do no help in the house. My brother is more close with my mom and to honestly tell you, I sometimes hate how he makes me feel. He'd somewhat start ganging up on me with my mom, and although not with verbal words, I can feel it. (I don't know how to explain this further). I know that I may sound immature to some for feeling this way, as yes, I don't do much work i n the house but I am trying... I can not justify this matter, but yelling at me, not doing any intimate talk about how I am doing is just what makes me unmotivated and to grow more avoidant with them, especially my mom. 

Being consumed in the internet and having the internet to make intimate talks with me probably wasn't good for my mental health and my whole being. I feel so alone, and knowing that school was my only distraction makes it worse. Waking up everyday. No distractions. I have been living on a loop for years now. The internet is the only thing that keeps me entertained, I'm paranoid for the fact that I'm going to feel this way for the rest of my life. I'm still young, and is in my early teenage years so I will still hold on for that hope it will get better. 

I don't know why I'm having thoughts like this. How do I stop? Am I just being dramatic for thinking this way, or are my thoughts valid?

Please help me to stop feeling this way.

,depression,"11 years ago I suffered a mild concussion from a skiing accident off a small jump at the age of 16. The accident itself wasn’t anything major, but I felt a sharp jolt to my head. Thinking it was just whiplash, I continued skiing well into the evening. The off feeling persisted, but didn’t think it could be a concussion since it was such a small fall. It also didn’t help my poles were stolen and thrown off the chairlift. The next day when I got into work I felt dizzy and even briefly forgot how to talk. I was diagnosed with a concussion on the spot and driven home.

For more context, I grew up with an extreme case of Dyslexia and mild ADHD in a household where there was a lot of arguing. I was no stranger to deep feelings of alienation and sadness. These feeling were never life threatening as I was always looking to the future. The months leading up to my concussion was a real sea change in my life, I developed a strong friend group, got my best report cards ever, made honor roll, became a accomplished student athlete breaking a school record and was league MVP. My parents weren’t arguing as much and they were expressing how proud of me they were. For the first time since I was a child I truly felt happy and optimistic. To top it off I met and began talking to the girl who would become my first real girlfriend and now my fiancé. I remember simple things like riding the subway or walking home from school and amazed at how great and full of color life was feeling. I felt truly comfortable in my skin.

Then I got concussed. Luckily enough it was at the start of February break so it was easier to lie in bed and relax. I missed the next week of school and when I stepped back into the world, everything felt different. The feeling of life being full of color was gone. It was like a reverse Wizard of Oz going from color to black and white. Truthfully things started to feel gray and I no longer felt comfortable in my skin.

Then my friend group was falling apart and constantly poking fun at me. My Dad’s company was in dire straits, my Mom had some of her own health problems which resulted in her violently lashing out. It also didn’t help this was the latter half of Jr Year when SATs and the start of college applications. 

A couple times I remember feeling so overwhelmed that I collapsed on the floor. For the first time, I felt truly depressed and didn’t know how to communicate how was truly feeling. When I tried to explain to my parents or friends how my brain was feeling and I was experiencing persistent headaches, they downplayed it saying I ‘get over it’ and that I only had a mild concussion. Even the doctors said I was fine, but I was too afraid to tell anyone just how badly I was struggling and the dark places my brain was going. 

It felt as if all hope had been sucked out of me. I used to wake up and excited to take on the day, now I was waking up and dreading the day ahead. I began having a more difficult time focusing on schoolwork and I totally bombed the SATs. The one saving grace was I was now in a very committed and loving relationship.

When I think back to my senior year of high school, all I am reminded of is feeling deeply depressed and always trying to hide it. All throughout college I was depressed, battled suicidal ideation and even took a semester off because I had a depressive episode. My senior year, my parents warmed up to my depression, it was easier to talk about and they were more supportive. My depression was at its worst the summer after my college graduation. Since college, each year has gotten progressively better and better. I went back into therapy and two years ago began taking antidepressants. Now I almost feel I have crawled out of a a depressive hole and gained my optimism back. 

Still I can’t help but notice the fact that it was that’s concussion 11 years ago when I truly started feeling depressed. I always blamed my depression on what was going on around me and the fact it runs in my family, but it was that concussion when I first felt my brain change and depression sink in. It’s almost as if I’m finally feeling I’ve recorded from the concussion. Would life have gotten harder due to the events that happened to those around me, yes but I feel my concussion made it worse. For the first time since I was 16, I’ve gone months without thoughts of suicide and is the least depressed I’ve felt since before the concussion. Still I can’t help but feel an aching sadness that maybe I wouldn’t have experienced this over decade long depression if I decided not to hit that small jump.

,depression,"People tell you to hang on in there and how it’ll get better, but I have spent almost all of my life waiting for it to get better and trying to change things and nothing has gotten any better. Believe me, I have tried so damn hard to change things and it very rarely if ever changes for the better. The rare time it does, it’s so short lived and never lasts. 

To be truthful I hate life. I don’t enjoy it. Every day is a god damn struggle, and I just want an off switch or to go to sleep and never wake up. I genuinely don’t have a reason to carry on, yet people will constantly guilt you by saying things like “what about your family” I have tried to talk to people numerous times and it only makes me feel worse. I get told things such as “I’m being stupid” “don’t be so silly” “what do you have to depressed about”

,depression,"Throwaway but I'm hitting 30(M) in a bit and I legitimately feel like I've hit a complete dead end in my life.

Lost my job two years back and been living off savings since - I had a pretty senior gig and I was essentially at the top of my peers but after losing it, it's hard to climb back to anywhere decent. But that's just the normie stuff, let's deep dive into the misery well for a bit while I allow myself some self-pity.

Since my teens, I've been suffering from unending headaches/migraines. Untreatable, and non-diagnosable. I wake up to pain, and I fall asleep to pain - my sleep is never rested because of this, and I've come to realise that I genuinely don't know what a good sleep actually is, after over a decade of this. I simply sleep for the physical benefits, but my mental has never benefitted from the process. The worst bit about the headaches, is that it chronically cripples me - it's hard to work out without it coming back to bite me and leave me unable to operate.

I moved back in during the pandemic, only to find that my dad has become a shell of himself due to a mix of dementia and Parkinson's - so it feels like part of my life has been lost due to a feeling of my mum needing me to be around to help out. I personally think the burnout from the sudden need to be a caregiver and juggling my job led to losing my gig, but it's whatever.

I can't find the motivation to do anything anymore. The fatigue, the headaches, the idea that I've become hopeless - it's all coalescing and I guess I needed to just write this all out and send it to the universe, even if it amounts to nothing.

At this point, I legitimately think I've given up. I exist to serve others, even the idea of offing myself is trapped by the idea that everyone would be burdened by it.

&lt;p&gt;Lost my job two years back and been living off savings since - I had a pretty senior gig and I was essentially at the top of my peers but after losing it, it&amp;#39;s hard to climb back to anywhere decent. But that&amp;#39;s just the normie stuff, let&amp;#39;s deep dive into the misery well for a bit while I allow myself some self-pity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my teens, I&amp;#39;ve been suffering from unending headaches/migraines. Untreatable, and non-diagnosable. I wake up to pain, and I fall asleep to pain - my sleep is never rested because of this, and I&amp;#39;ve come to realise that I genuinely don&amp;#39;t know what a good sleep actually is, after over a decade of this. I simply sleep for the physical benefits, but my mental has never benefitted from the process. The worst bit about the headaches, is that it chronically cripples me - it&amp;#39;s hard to work out without it coming back to bite me and leave me unable to operate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I moved back in during the pandemic, only to find that my dad has become a shell of himself due to a mix of dementia and Parkinson&amp;#39;s - so it feels like part of my life has been lost due to a feeling of my mum needing me to be around to help out. I personally think the burnout from the sudden need to be a caregiver and juggling my job led to losing my gig, but it&amp;#39;s whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t find the motivation to do anything anymore. The fatigue, the headaches, the idea that I&amp;#39;ve become hopeless - it&amp;#39;s all coalescing and I guess I needed to just write this all out and send it to the universe, even if it amounts to nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I legitimately think I&amp;#39;ve given up. I exist to serve others, even the idea of offing myself is trapped by the idea that everyone would be burdened by it. I have friends, sure, but who would want to listen to all this. They know bits and pieces but I generally am rather high-functioning so it&amp;#39;s under covers for most of my life. Quite sure a lot of people would be freaked if they saw the true depths of my despair.&lt;/p&gt;

There's times that i want to do something, i'm determined to really, but the depression makes it impossible to, and i get even more depressed about the fact that i can't get myself to do it. 
For example, my biggest issue right now is that i've been trying to lose weight. I'm 92kgs, and it's been heavily affecting my self esteem, especially because i'm a short person too, i'm 158cm, and the weight really shows. Every time i look at myself in the mirror, i feel so many horrible things, from disgusting, to disappointment, to sadness. And it's even harder for me because i have a beautiful face, as everybody around me says. And i get all sorts of comments on my body, people will tell me ""you are gorgeous if it wasn't for your body"", even my mom says stuff like that, i've heard comments from her that broke my heart on many different occasions. I've never really bothered to change anything about my body for a long time, until a couple of months ago, it just all came to me like a hurricane. And i felt like i wasn't comfortable with my body anymore. So i've been wanting to do something about it, i've even created a whole plan, to sign up at a gym and and start working out, take walks and exercise everyday, start jumping ropes at home, eating healthier, no more junk food and unhealthy beverages. But i've been too depressed to even start doing anything. And because i'm not doing anything, it's making me even more depressed, and i've been just stuck in this cycle for the past month. And i have no idea how to get out of it. I can't being myself to even get out of the house, i'm staying up until 6:00 AM, and sleeping until 2:00pm if not more sometimes, i've been skipping my meds, and i've been really irritable and angry. I'm unemployed at the moment because i'm too focused on my studies, i have one year left to get my masters degree, and i'm always so stressed during the semester, so i wouldn't be able to pull of working and studying at the same time, especially with my BPD and my unpredictable mood swings. And every day, my parents give me shit about doing nothing with my life and just sitting at home all day during the summer, and part of that feels true, but i'm an illustrator for a reason; i'm a major introvert and i'm socially anxious as mentioned before, so being an illustrator is my dream job, i could do stuff from home instead of being an employee and sticking to a schedule. I want to maybe be a youtuber, create art content, or maybe writing and illustrating my own comic book, or anything that allows me make a living in a way that's comfortable for me.

Life has just gotten worse and worse and at this point it literally cannot get any worse. Everyone tells me it could... &amp;quot;oh you&amp;#39;ll get cancer if you keep smoking so much&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;your drinking will kill you&amp;quot;. GOOD I FUCKING HOPE SO. Thats why I do it, I hope it does kill me. I just give up. I can&amp;#39;t take any more of this. No amount of therapy or medication has done anything to take away the pain of loosing my daughter. Nothing ever will. She should have been my everything, but instead I&amp;#39;m sat here with nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I’m not a troll this is genuinely what I’ve been going through the past 2 years.

I’m nearly 18 and 2 years ago when I was 16 I was in a really bad place. I was depressed and isolated myself in my room every single day for nearly the whole year. I was dealing with other issues at the time which led to this. I had been watching porn 1-2 times a day since I was 10  but when I isolated myself it went up to 2-3 times a day. I always knew I was straight and never thought differently. I have seen gay porn and trans porn before and it doesn’t turn me on at all as I don’t like it.

When I was depressed and watched a lot of porn, I ended up looking at pictures of a feminine looking man that was in a bikini and had surgery to look like a woman. There was no nudity involved and I was only focusing on the butt nothing else. I did this a few more times over the next few months (probably only another 5 times within 3-4 months). 

After the last time, the regret suddenly sunk in and since then I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and honestly I hate myself for doing this stuff.

I’m not trying to be homophobic. I just always knew I was straight. Since I realised my actions, I look at the pictures to see if I’m still aroused by them, but each time I am disgusted by them.

I feel straight again and I honestly do not ever desire to look at those pictures ever again, but I also feel like I am unable to be straight again after the actions I had done in the past.

Is it possible for me to be straight like I was before? I genuinely do not have any desire to do it again and I regret it so much. I’ve been suicidal for nearly two years I just can’t cope with what I had done.

,depression,"Some facts about me:

\* I'm 25, soon to be 26 and I stayed inside my house for almost a decade (From 2014 to 2024.) Dealing with depression/anxiety.

\* Never had a job.

\* Don't have any friends. 

\* Came from an incestuous family.

\* I live in a shitty little town —roughly 6 thousand people— with no opportunities.

\* Never had a partner. 

\* still a virgin, never kissed anyone, never gone out on dates etc..

\* I'm black and a homosexual — gosh!!! Could it get any worse??? Absolutely!!!!— overweight and unattractive. 

\* I have no one to support me financially.

\* I have nothing.

I wish I were in a better place today, I wish I had a better family, a normal family, I wish I had someone to support me emotionally...  It hurts seeing people succeed in life while I'm here, stuck at home, I feel like I was left behind.. I have so many situations in my life that I never had the chance to experience, and it's not that the opportunities presented itself to me and I turned my back on them, certain opportunities were never offered me in the first place, It has been incredibly difficult, I wasted so many years of my life, my youth is gone now. I'm feeling lost, I don't know what to do honestly, I have gone out trying to find a job, but for whatever reason no one will hire me, not even the local grocery stores. 

What am I supposed to do? I'm scared. Truthfully, I do not want to kill myself, I want to live!!! I just wish life weren't this difficult. I'm not asking for anything glamorous, I just want to live a calm, simple, life... A  stable job, have friends, a partner, have a dog or two, start a family, live as comfortably/peacefully/peaceably as I fucking possibly can. That's it! I'm not asking for much!!! 

I just want someone to talk to in REAL LIFE, All I want right now is affection — in a non sexual way— I haven't hugged anyone in years. Can you imagine that?? I'm not even exaggerating, I have literally no one to talk to besides myself and the walls..  I'm the unluckiest guy on earth!!! Damn!! For so many years I had these fantasies about someone knocking on my door, looking  for me, coming to my rescue, but that never happened, and it never will. 

As I have mentioned, my family was incestuous, so we do have lots of issues. We barely talk to each other, we go weeks and months without exchanging a word.. My mom's new boyfriend is a morbidly obese alcoholic, my older sister found herself a husband and she moved away and never talked to us again. 

Recently my mother had both of her legs amputated —due to diabetes mellitus— and I am her caregiver, and I will probably be her caregiver for the rest of her life. Problem is: If I do killl myself I will be killing my mother —indirectly— as well. Because who's going to take care of her? Her boyfriend spends 99% of his time drinking, or high on drugs, or stuffing his face with food!!! 

The question is: Is there any way that I can improve my life or is it over for me??? Can someone please give me an honest answer? Do I still have time to live a normal and happy life?? Keep in mind that I am approaching my thirties... 

By the way, sorry if my post doesn't make any sense/ is unclear. I was homeschooled so I do not have a lot of knowledge.

,depression,"I have vitnessed violance in childhood, grew up without a father and a proper friendgroup. All my life I was on the weirder side of people. Never once there was a moment I didnt feel lonely and melancholic. Even when I have a good time, I realize I will miss that moment that happens very rarely and it breaks me. This last year was especially bad as I started realizing how unambitious and purposeless I really am. 2 months ago my GF of 1.5 years dumped me, and it was already the worst period of my life before that. I got over it but as I started anti-depressants a while back, I got too lazy and now I can't even clean my apartment. I failed most my lectures too. Today I got fired from a job I got in yesterday and cant even talk about it to someone. Whenever I think I have friends I realize I am the only one keeping the conversations, not once I am called or asked how I am. I stopped keeping those conversations lately, out of respect for myself. But I just don't know how to fix this. Surviving a day, passing the time, leaving the bed is just torture. I don't have suicidal thoughts, but I would rather not be born.

All my life I was on the weirder side of people. Never once there was a moment I didnt feel lonely and melancholic. Even when I have a good time, I realize I will miss that moment that happens very rarely and it breaks me. This last year was especially bad as I started realizing how unambitious and purposeless I really am. 2 months ago my GF of 1.5 years dumped me, and it was already the worst period of my life before that. I got over it but as I started anti-depressants a while back, I got too lazy and now I can&amp;#39;t even clean my apartment. I failed most my lectures too. Today I got fired from a job I got in yesterday and cant even talk about it to someone. Whenever I think I have friends I realize I am the only one keeping the conversations, not once I am called or asked how I am. I stopped keeping those conversations lately, out of respect for myself. But I just don&amp;#39;t know how to fix this. Surviving a day, passing the time, leaving the bed is just torture. I don&amp;#39;t have suicidal thoughts, but I would rather not be born.

There's a constant needling and sarcasm, and I just don't feel rapport with anyone. It's like I'm not on anybody else's wavelength. I used to feel connected to people, but not anymore. I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I've tried so hard putting myself out there, but all it leads to is more things I don't want to do and environments I don't want to be in. I quit teaching because of it. Before that I quit university. I quit sports. I quit hobbies. I quit clubs. I've quit friendships. I've quit everything and just decided that getting my work life to function is my top priority. But I feel constant guilt that I'm not playing sports, not dating, not decorating my apartment, not practicing guitar or chess, not eating healthy, not cooking enough for myself.

My brother critizices everyone for everything, but he still hurts me when he points out what I don't do.

Of course I concider suicide, but it's obviously not what I want. It comes from not living up to what I think society wants from me. Don't spam me with the suicide hotline stuff. I don't live in the US.

I've tried therapy, but I can't navigate that system. I can't afford private help and I don't know how to fit it into a schedule. Nobody else at my work takes time off for frequent appointments. When I've gotten ""help"" it's mostly been a shitshow of wrong diagnoses, being tossed around the system, talking to people with no empathy or sympathy for my situation, being coerced into taking antipsychotics, only for the professionals to change their minds about what is actually wrong. At this point I have a diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder with schizoid tendencies, which might be correct.

Right now I have 3 weeks off work. Just sitting in my apartment feeling guilty about not doing anything. People think it's weird I don't have plans and is not going traveling. It's my birthday in a week and I have nothing planned. I never have had plans for my birthday since I was a child. I don't actually have any friends where I live.

,depression,"
I (22M) have been dating this wonderful girl (23F) for 8 months now. I love her very much, she has everything I could ask for in a girlfriend. However, our relationship hasn't been easy as we both suffer from poor mental health. She has officially diagnosed depression which makes her operate on low energy and often delve into anxious thoughts. She's also a college student, so even though she receives treatment, her health has really nosedived this semester.

Throughout our relationship, she would frequently comment on her feeling inadequate. Phrases like 'I'm fat', or 'I'm stupid', or 'I'm lazy', or 'I don't do well at school'. Every time I would either comfort her and say she's perfect the way she is or try and encourage her to see the situation from a different perspective. For example, I would say, 'Look at what you have achieved on medication and low energy! You have a  severe mental condition, and yet other people perceive you as a sort of a genius. That's something to be EXTREMELY proud of!'

However, I have my own issues. For the past 8 months (what a coincidence) I've been helping my family take care of my nana who suffers from dementia. We're too poor to afford a nursing home and mother and father are severely unprepared to care for a terminally ill person. We have bickered, argued, our family has basically fallen apart. This has taken a toll on my mental health.

My gf's state has also got worse. She began crying and feeling inadequate more frequently. She would tell me how she wasn't proud of herself and how she wished she died. And in my poor mental state, instead of encouraging her, I became harsh and abrasive. We bickered about small things and would often have difficult conversations about the relationship and our issues. I would get extremely arrogant and all but outright state how much I had helped her when she needed help. She would also get anxious thoughts and doubts about both our relationship and my intentions with her.

She went on a family vacation in early July. We had several more difficult convos, and then she decided to reduce contact with me. She said it wasn't a break and that she still wanted a relationship, it's just that she needed to recharge and recuperate. We've only been briefly updating each other on how our day went since. She will come back on July 27 and then we'll get to talk about everything. 

Had I had better control over my state, I would've handled hers. And now, I fear, I might have damaged the relationship irreversibly. 

TL;DR:

I can barely get in the courage to text my friends I ghost them because I feel like they don't care and I know I'm a bad friend for doing this I try not to but my anxiety is too much. I've done so many bad things to my body and my self worth is just so shattered. Last year in September I told my parents I am aromantic (one who does not experience romantic attraction) and they kinda brushed it off. I set a note on their nightstand loosely explaining stuff. The next day, my mom just told me ""that's a cool thing to learn about yourself"" and my dad asked if I wanted to tell anyone and that ""you may not want a romantic relationship, but later in life you'll desire companionship"". They never asked any more questions. It has been 10 stupid fucking months. I don't have the strength to tell them I'm asexual, bi, and want to identify as gender neutral. They brushed it off and I fucking hate it. My dad also thought it was funny one time to call trans people ""transformers"" when talking about a law our state passed. In front of my grandparents. I don't even care anymore about wanting to identify as gender neutral I'll just suppress it for a while

They also brushed off my voice, which for almost 2 years has been pitched around an E#4-C5 (it changes based on my mood/volume I'm trying to reach) and I can't raise my voice's volume or deepen my pitch (though I can hit some sick notes like the highest note of Cemetery Gates by Pantera, which is an A5). At all. I think I have a thing called puberphonia (look it up) and I can't even really talk if there are more than 5 people talking in a classroom. I asked them if I could go to a doctor and my mom got angry and told me ""do you want me to take you to a speech therapist""? No, not anymore, because you are fucking angry and you truly don't care. That was last December. They are going to talk to my doctor about it at my next checkup, they said. They said that a month ago. My next checkup is in like 2 weeks. They don't even care enough to get me help, they just wait it out. They don't know what it's like to learn sign language and before bed wish your voice just stops when you wake up.

I got h.arassed for over 20 minutes in front of my 8th period class in May by multiple people and they made fun of my identity and my voice and I felt really shitty I did some bad things that night.

,depression,"ok so, for a little backstory i (17M) have mild autism, and me and my ex (17F) were dating for about 4 months but they were the best 4 months of my life, i had known her for about 5 years through secondary, and had a crush on her for 3-4 years while she was in another relationship and apparently she liked me back, i had written songs about her and had a special song which reminded me of her (looking out for you - joy again). simply put, we had a lot of history. in our relationship, she made me feel happiness like ive never felt before but she broke up with me just over a week ago and we talked for the following few days then went no contact, leaving on good terms. today i reached out to her just to acknowledge the breakup, not to beg or anything like that i simply just wanted to talk to her as friends.


we got onto the topic of the breakup and she seemed reluctant to talk about it which i kinda get and she even said ""You can text me about anything that you want to just not the break up"". this is roughly how the convo went:

me: ""hi""

her: ""hi?""

i asked her how shes been and then i said:

me: ""i just wanted to say i want you to be happy thats all i want, i just honestly wish i did better as a boyfriend for you because you deserve it""

her: ""You’ve said before [...] You don’t seem ok""

me: ""i know but its natural [...] its just ive been thinking a lot about our relationship and issues that could be solved but i understand we need space and i dont want to push anything onto you i just wanted to be completely transparent with you that i still love you and i still care""

her: ""Thank you""

and i asked a question i probably shouldnt have. i asked:

""do you still have feelings for me"" 

and i got:

""Stop trying to hurt yourself""

but i pushed and told her itd help me move on, and she said:

""No I don’t [...] If I still had feelings for you I would still be with you""

that shot a cold sharp pain through my heart but now i guess i just feel numb. i know i messed up and did stuff wrong i understand that now but its too late to change it, i just want her back. i felt like me and her had something really special. and i dont know how long ill be lonely again for and im afraid of never feeling love like it again, but my friend stated maybe i feel like this because she gave me my first taster of what a good relationship is like, and i seek validation and happiness from her because of this as well as me liking her for so long and she liked me back, and our history and how special the relationship felt. which is maybe why i dont want it to go away.

anyways, when i told her she made me really happy in the relationship she replied with:

"" It never felt like I made you happy ever [...] How did you think that made me feel""

i feel like i expressed my happiness all the time around but i guess she didnt feel the same. i replied with:

""awful, and for that im truly sorry""

everything just sucks, i wish i had appreciated her more and been more grateful for her company because now shes gone shes all i want. i know i screwed up but my friends seem to think im putting too much of the blame on myself.


another thing that has given me mixed signals is that she is really open and happy to talk about anything other than the breakup, like she will carry convos and stuff if it isnt about us separating but is extremely dry if anything about our breakup is mentioned. also, the day we broke up which was a thursday, (tmi) she was sending me sexual messages and i was reciprocating, but then she went and met her friend and about an hour later i received a breakup message. for the last day or so before this we didnt message much but i thought that was because we had just spent 3 days straight together catsitting, and we probably needed some time away from each other im not sure. anyways, the sexual messages to a breakup text seemed to me like a drastic change and when i asked how long she'd been feeling like this she said:

""since monday"" (when we started catsitting, which to me doesnt seem like a lot of time to rethink an entire relationship but i will respect her ultimate decision)

and when i asked for some reasons because there wasnt really any in the breakup text i got (and im paraphrasing):

she needed to focus on herself
she felt like she didnt see me as much as she wanted to (im in college to do a-levels, go to the gym and work but i saw her as often as i could)
she needed to focus on her mental health
she felt we werent on the same page anymore and to be fair we didnt have many mutual interests but that didnt bother me
she thought it was for the best


i picked up my stuff the next day, friday, and we talked for about an hour in my car, i promised myself i wouldnt cry or anything but i couldnt stop myself. she comforted me which was nice and like i said we went to sit in my car to talk stuff out. we talked like we were still in a relationship, she even called me ""babe"" twice on accident. she sorta gave me hope by saying she might regret it and sorta hinted at the possibility of getting back together once she worked on herself but told me not to wait for her. however, her friend (the one she was with when she sent the breakup text) had also recently broken up with her boyfriend (coincidentally one of my friends) and she sorta gave him hope and the half-promise of getting back together, yet is now going on a date with another guy currently and its broke my friends heart. anyways, and before she left my car after we talked for that hour she sorta lingered for a bit, like she wanted to say something or she wanted me to say something, so i just asked her if she wanted one final kiss and she agreed and we kissed and said ""i love you"" one final time and we agreed we'd miss each other.

i forgot about some photos of me and her i had ordered and they arrived on monday, i asked her if she wanted them back and she said:

""oh shit i forgot about those. no i dont want them""

another thing is that i work with her mother and her auntie, and her mother is absolutely lovely she gave me a hug and asked how i was doing because we both really liked each other. we just chatted for a bit and i guess agreed it wasnt meant to be, and i thanked her for always making me feel welcome in her home and in her family. she said im welcome anytime and that my ex still cares about me just i guess we werent meant to be. her mother told me that im a lovely boy and she joked that she wished i had a good influence on my ex, and i joked back saying i tried.

also, one last thing i promise, she and her ex went together for 3 years, and broke up and got back together multiple times and he was honestly an awful human being. so why does she hate the chance of a retry with me when (not trying to sound narcissistic or anything) i was so much better to her than he was.


anyways, enough ranting. i feel numb currently but i know its going to hit me like a truck later and ill be miserable. i was thinking maybe i could call her and ask if she wants to go on a walk sometime as friends and maybe we could rekindle something then as i truly believe if she just gives me a second chance we can truly change things and i can be the best boyfriend to her.

i dont know though, i want to respect her decisions and if thats without me i guess i must accept it and try my hardest to move on. but i feel awful. the thought of her with another man hurts me so much, i just want to show her i can be a better person.

any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you very much for your time.",t2_v9tz3agx,False,,0,False,can i do anything if my ex says she doesnt have feelings for me anymore but i want a second chance,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e4mifg,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,1721131864.0,,[],{},,True,,1721130214.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;ok so, for a little backstory i (17M) have mild autism, and me and my ex (17F) were dating for about 4 months but they were the best 4 months of my life, i had known her for about 5 years through secondary, and had a crush on her for 3-4 years while she was in another relationship and apparently she liked me back, i had written songs about her and had a special song which reminded me of her (looking out for you - joy again). simply put, we had a lot of history. in our relationship, she made me feel happiness like ive never felt before but she broke up with me just over a week ago and we talked for the following few days then went no contact, leaving on good terms. today i reached out to her just to acknowledge the breakup, not to beg or anything like that i simply just wanted to talk to her as friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we got onto the topic of the breakup and she seemed reluctant to talk about it which i kinda get and she even said &amp;quot;You can text me about anything that you want to just not the break up&amp;quot;. this is roughly how the convo went:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;me: &amp;quot;hi&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;her: &amp;quot;hi?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i asked her how shes been and then i said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;me: &amp;quot;i just wanted to say i want you to be happy thats all i want, i just honestly wish i did better as a boyfriend for you because you deserve it&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;her: &amp;quot;You’ve said before [...] You don’t seem ok&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;me: &amp;quot;i know but its natural [...] its just ive been thinking a lot about our relationship and issues that could be solved but i understand we need space and i dont want to push anything onto you i just wanted to be completely transparent with you that i still love you and i still care&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;her: &amp;quot;Thank you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and i asked a question i probably shouldnt have. i asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;do you still have feelings for me&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and i got:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Stop trying to hurt yourself&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but i pushed and told her itd help me move on, and she said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No I don’t [...] If I still had feelings for you I would still be with you&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that shot a cold sharp pain through my heart but now i guess i just feel numb. i know i messed up and did stuff wrong i understand that now but its too late to change it, i just want her back. i felt like me and her had something really special. and i dont know how long ill be lonely again for and im afraid of never feeling love like it again, but my friend stated maybe i feel like this because she gave me my first taster of what a good relationship is like, and i seek validation and happiness from her because of this as well as me liking her for so long and she liked me back, and our history and how special the relationship felt. which is maybe why i dont want it to go away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;anyways, when i told her she made me really happy in the relationship she replied with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot; It never felt like I made you happy ever [...] How did you think that made me feel&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i feel like i expressed my happiness all the time around but i guess she didnt feel the same. i replied with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;awful, and for that im truly sorry&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;everything just sucks, i wish i had appreciated her more and been more grateful for her company because now shes gone shes all i want. i know i screwed up but my friends seem to think im putting too much of the blame on myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;another thing that has given me mixed signals is that she is really open and happy to talk about anything other than the breakup, like she will carry convos and stuff if it isnt about us separating but is extremely dry if anything about our breakup is mentioned. also, the day we broke up which was a thursday, (tmi) she was sending me sexual messages and i was reciprocating, but then she went and met her friend and about an hour later i received a breakup message. for the last day or so before this we didnt message much but i thought that was because we had just spent 3 days straight together catsitting, and we probably needed some time away from each other im not sure. anyways, the sexual messages to a breakup text seemed to me like a drastic change and when i asked how long she&amp;#39;d been feeling like this she said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;since monday&amp;quot; (when we started catsitting, which to me doesnt seem like a lot of time to rethink an entire relationship but i will respect her ultimate decision)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and when i asked for some reasons because there wasnt really any in the breakup text i got (and im paraphrasing):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she needed to focus on herself
she felt like she didnt see me as much as she wanted to (im in college to do a-levels, go to the gym and work but i saw her as often as i could)
she needed to focus on her mental health
she felt we werent on the same page anymore and to be fair we didnt have many mutual interests but that didnt bother me
she thought it was for the best&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i picked up my stuff the next day, friday, and we talked for about an hour in my car, i promised myself i wouldnt cry or anything but i couldnt stop myself. she comforted me which was nice and like i said we went to sit in my car to talk stuff out. we talked like we were still in a relationship, she even called me &amp;quot;babe&amp;quot; twice on accident. she sorta gave me hope by saying she might regret it and sorta hinted at the possibility of getting back together once she worked on herself but told me not to wait for her. however, her friend (the one she was with when she sent the breakup text) had also recently broken up with her boyfriend (coincidentally one of my friends) and she sorta gave him hope and the half-promise of getting back together, yet is now going on a date with another guy currently and its broke my friends heart. anyways, and before she left my car after we talked for that hour she sorta lingered for a bit, like she wanted to say something or she wanted me to say something, so i just asked her if she wanted one final kiss and she agreed and we kissed and said &amp;quot;i love you&amp;quot; one final time and we agreed we&amp;#39;d miss each other.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm 28, had to move back in with my parents last year, and lost my girlfriend 6 months ago. I have so many regrets from my past, like quitting two different career paths which has led me to this point of being broke. And me being broke heavily contributed to losing the woman I thought I'd marry. 

Many people will say don't worry about the past, it can't be changed. Instead focus on be future. Well, I'm going back to school and will have a career that pays 70-130k depending on where I go in the country. It's not bad money, enough to live and maybe even afford a modest home, but I'll never be wealthy from it. I'll have to save and invest and work until I'm old just to have a chance at retiring. My time will never be my own, I'll be a wage slave my whole life. I have very little hope of being happy in the future, but I'm approaching 30. I can't keep putting off a career. 

""Okay then,"" some might say. ""Just focus on the present."" How can I do so with no money, no one to love and cherish, and no hope for the future? The only thing that's kept me alive are my friends. I'm thankful every day that I'm not as lonely as many other depressed people are. But it's not enough... not whenever I feel like my life is out of my control and my future is so uncertain.

This alone may not be horrible, but I actively desire to feel that connection but I can't. I tend to feel guilty at work when I say hi to people, because I know that there could be a potential connection between us but I can't feel it or find it.

&gt;Sorry for the long post, this sounds like a rant.

I'm aware of my seemingly lack of appreciation towards things especially the ones closely to me. Sadly it's affected my hobby which is photography and my point was to maybe see whether there's some photographers who've had those kinds of experiences, because I'm genuinely looking for help.

(Note: I never meant to be a jerk to anyone. A lot of people don't see me as a jerk, and I've tried to change my actions to be kinder and better. I never tried to do any of this to impress anyone. I did it because I was naive and being a dumbass)

I'm sorry for venting I just have nobody to vent to. I've just been holding this in too long.

I've made some really dick moves and I feel like a terrible person. I've hurt people I didn't mean to hurt (I never meant to hurt anyone emotionally or physically, but I guess I didn't realize I hurt them emotionally), and I feel terrible thinking that I might have caused them to do something to themselves they might deeply regret, and I might've started some downward spiral and I feel super guilty.

When I was in 7th grade (a few years ago), I didn't know I was aroace (aromantic and asexual, lacking romantic or sexual attraction) so I felt confused and hormones were weird and shit so I got obsessed with other people's relationships because I was basically suppressing the fact that I hadn't really ever liked anyone. There was this one girl my friend and I talked to like every day in PE and I didn't think I was being a dick. Looking back, I know I was. I'm 80% sure she liked me but I didn't understand people actually lied about not liking someone. She said she hated me and I quite literally told her how much I didn't like her. She was probably lying. I was not. I was being a fucking piece of shit to her and I didn't realize it. She thought I liked her, and she thought I was lying about what I was saying.

There was another incident where she thought I liked her but it was because there was multiple threats written in the bathroom at our school and my friend and I were almost certain her and her bf did it (note: we had nothing against them. She was sweet and kind and thhe bf was a chill guy. We just had pretty good evidence and we went up to the principal, ect) so we were happy when they broke up because we thought one of them would confess. She was crying. I didn't know how much breakups were supposed to hurt. (Note: nothing bad happened at our school, just the threats. Nobody knows who wrote them.)

This one I feel the worst about. She and her bf broke up and she was bawling her eyes out for like 2 days. I wanted to show the ex-bf how much he was hurting her, so I wrote a letter to him ""from"" her. Not the best move but I was confused and naive at the time. I ended up switching the to and from names and it got given to her. I've never been so guilty and never seen someone so sad. I tried to apologize and make up, and she let me. She told me ""we're square"" and we never talked again after I did what she asked me to so we could be even.

I feel like such a dick and I never meant to hurt her but here I am. I would quite literally do anything, even sexual (again, I'm asexual. I've literally had nightmares about sex). She said we're square but I know we aren't and its been a few years but I feel so guilty I hope I never do anything like that again. I don't think I'll even be able to forgive myself and I'm now depressed but I totally deserve it for what I did.

,depression,"I'm 27M and I can't really see the point in this anymore. I can't remember the last time I was happy and I always said I'll kill myself when I turn 30, but honestly I reached a point where I'll be surprised if I make it to next year. 

No one really knows the real me. I have no one to talk to, the few friends that I have left think depression is a scam and make jokes whenever the subject comes up. This didn't use to bother me but over the last few years I got close enought to open up to 2 girls. Both ended up ghosting me after about a year each. I probably would have killed myself after the first one if the second one (who I was already friends with, just not close friends) wouldn't have noticed that something is wrong with me. I finally had someone who I could be me with, and now that I lost that I don't know how to go back. It didn't used to bother me before but I was 14, the struggles were easier to handle and I didn't constantly feel that it's too late. 

Just once in this entire fucking life I wish I was enough for someone. Just once I wish someone found me attractive or interesting enough to pursue a connection with me. People usually try the ""oh but you actually are enough"", ""you do matter"", ""you'll find the right person"" bullshit but after 27 fucking years of life constantly showing me that's not true, I cannot for the life of me imagine how things would ever change. Everytime I change and make an effort it just kicks me back down from higher up. Even if by a miracle someone is attracted to me, how could I keep them close having 0 experience in dating and this huge baggage of issues. You will probably say I need to work on those issues and once they are all gone someone understanding will fall out of the sky and we'll live happily ever after. How can you fix a non existing self esteem when time and time again you gathered enough confidence to try again only for it to be destroyed in pieces smaller than before. How can I think ""Nah I can do this"" when time and time again I was shown I cannot.

,depression,"You know, I'm a person who doesnt give a fuck even if things are serious. The reason is because Im confident that I can take care of it once it comes to bite my ass. I also have a lot of patience, so I dont mind if people will talk shit about me or even get physical, because I know I can get through this..   
  
But these days, I think I've had enough. I'm always getting suicidal thoughts (I look fine but Im mentally unstable/dying inside), the worst part is I cant talk to anyone about it since all the people around me have grown on the fact that I AM A MAN OF STEEL! I CAN DO ANYTHING AS LONG AS I PUT EFFORT AND TIME INTO IT!! THERE IS NO PROBLEM I CAN NOT SOLVE!!!!!!!!!!

But shit! Do they even know the pain I had to go through to do that..? I've been putting a lot of work and effort into things and they think I was able to do it EFFORTLESS.. They all think Im some kind of superhuman who can do fucking anything. Everytime I get serious like I wanna speak up, they all just laugh it off since they think Im joking and that I even have the balls to boast.. (They think Im being humble since I was able to do things they couldnt) 

That's why since highschool.. I bottled everything up. My problems, my stress, anxiety, you name it. I kept it to myself since no one else would listen to me talk about it. I realized that the world really is cruel.. or its just that Im with the wrong people. But the fuck can I do? I've grown attached to them too. I wanna break free and leave but.. I cant. I'm friends with almost everyone around me, if I do it.. It'd probably fuck me over. I know I said in the first part that Im confident to take care of stuff, but we're talking about PEOPLE, and not just 2 or 3, but a literal cluster of people. I dont think I can take care of something like that.

That's why.. these days I've been thinking. Should I just k!ll myself..? To just end this shit of a life.. But Im also scared. Im not ready to die but I am willing to.. Man this is just bullshit.. Why cant I live peacefully and happily like those around me..? Everyone else looks so happy to be with me but why am I not happy to be with them?

There was this one time, I fell for a girl.. I got teased and pressured by them. Wanna know what I did? Nothing. My genuine feelings for this girl got erased since I couldnt handle the pressure. Like man, cant they give me space?! I want to work my feelings with her without anyone's bullshit getting in the way.. In the end, I did try to pursue her but I could tell she was just not interested at all. Adding in the fact that I wasted my time, I just decided to completely erase the feeling of ROMANTIC LOVE. I even went out of my way to change my own perspective of LOVE. Now I just see it as some bullshit people use as an excuse to make you do their shit. It took me years to realize all of this, and let me say. The feeling of being able to not care about that shit and move on in life is amazing. 

So if you're dealing with something similar, here's my tip:

- Just dont even care, time will pass and you'll get used to it  
- If you have the confidence to change it into a happy ending, dont do it. Trust me, I tried and no one cared. (Though if your friends and family really do care about you, do it. My life is a mess so I cant really change anything since no one that I know cares about me)

,depression,"Physically.. And probably mentally.. I am weak, its hard for me to get out of old habits..like skipping school, smoking weed.. Not doing the right things, but not necessarily bad things, just things that wont you anywhere. I know i am weak, what i didnt know until recently was that well, i am pathetic. I was smoking with a good friend of mine around 4 months ago, now usually i dont ask these kinds of things or bring it up because its hard for me to express myself, like REALLY hard.. Even to parents, sister, brother.. Doesn't matter i just cant bring myself to burden other people with my problems (even though it would probably help a ton just to express a bit) but i asked my friend

 ""what do you really think about me?""
Friend: ""what do you mean?""
Me: ""when you look at me, what do you think?""
Friend: ""honestly, you're pretty pathetic..""

Damn.. That hurt but.. Its true, and the truth hurts. He said i am pathetic for the same reasons i mentioned. Skipping class, smoking too much, not focused on the right things. At that time i was really sad. And i still am, but now i realize it in its fullest.

I am weak, and i am pathetic.. There is jus nothing else to it
Im a bitch.. Simple as that.. I get scared easily (though i try not to show it) by things like loud sounds, or seeing a group of people walk by (i have been jumped before by around 7 to 8 people, so you can imagine how i feel)
I got set up and robbed by my own ""friends"".. Ouch, bye bye brand new shoes and puffer. I told my mom, and she told me how she worked so hard for those.. Not too long after, i heard her crying.. Im just so weak.. I really am a loser, no doubt about it.. There was times in school (when i actually went) that i would try to fit in, but i always got clowned on.. Or just got told im corny, not funny.. Ect. 
I have a few friends as of right now including the one i asked, he wouldn't say it to me.. But he knows, and the other know what i am.. They know i am a bitch, but they wouldn't say it.. I cry easily as well, im very emotional. It doesn't take a lot for me to cry on the inside, act like everything is ok.. Then go home and cry, USUALLY. As of right now though, i a unable to cry.. Even if i try my hardest i just cant. I think i am numb. 
A numb, weak, pathetic bitch. My living situation at home isnt bad, i have a nice mom and dad.. A brother and sister as mentioned.. They care for me, and i care for them too. I have too much patience with people, even if sometimes my friends act like dicks.. I never even really bring it up.. Because i know what they could hit me with is ""and what could you do about it?"" 
Nothing.. Nothing at all.. So i just stay quiet..
I am also pretty lonely, my 1st relationship was the worst expereince ever, got used.. She admitted she used me to get over her ex, it only lastes 1 month and a few weeks but it felt genuine.. Something i haven't felt before, but nope. Gone. Oh? And she got with my best friend shortly after!! And guess what? He didnt ask me, let me know.. Or nothing, i had to figure it out myself and when i did.. I just, still didn't do anything.. Before i found out, he actually told my other friends that he asked me, and i let him.. I did not.

,depression,"Yeah been im in a bit of a moment,  after  realizing that all those feelings that I use to ignore  as far as people  not having  my best interests  or gaf about me on a human  to human  level, yeah I get it now great right. Don't get me wrong it's not that im not thankful for the break thru, but come on who would be happy realizing that those intrusive thoughts were intuition,  and your distance and  introverted behavior was your body being so highly trained to protect  you that you subconsciously avoided the discomfort of knowing  how people  you truly  loved  don't love you nor just want  to allow  you to exist at the same time dodging the opportunities  they took for your reactions at your lowest to benefit  the negative narrative they spread  about you. Like I wish I knew  sooner and also not all. Not to mention  I've  been so emotionally overwhelmed that I haven't  been  working consistently 😕  at least  me spending  time with my kinds is getting  better  but they don't need an emotionally and financially broke father, I feel  like utter trash.

Nothing really matters, because in a billion years the sun will go out and we'll be wiped into obscurity. The fact is that there's no real deeper destiny or secret meaning to the human race, and we're truly not a result of anything other than crazy chance. This tiny spinning rock in space just happened to have the perfect distance from a star and balance of elements to create and continuously support life. And we're nothing more than a bunch of clumps of cells that somehow evolved to think and, as a result, understand the utter gravity and hopelessness of this insignificance. Because it is hopeless.

And yet, we live. Nothing matters, and yet we form relationships and create art and get angry when we lose in a video game and feel nice when we're sleeping on soft things. And we create customs in which every person has their own day per year when they are celebrated for simply being alive. And we harness lightning and transport it through rocks we found in the ground just so we can be warm and have light and watch videos of other humans. And we feel enough loyalty to which part of our tiny planet we were born on or which category of other humans we are attracted to that we hang designs of cloth to represent those parts of ourselves. And we understand how little our small pocket of life matters and have moments of sadness, when the gravity of existence and obscurity places its full weight onto our chests. This sadness too, this feeling of lonely unites us. Because our world is small, but we are all living on it. Because there's a whole lot of black out there, and yet right now we are close enough to a star to bathe in its warmth and light. 

And when a billion years from now the sun goes out we will die, and that will mean none of our experiences will have had a single effect on the broader history of the universe. But still they happened, and maybe that's enough to say they mattered, at least to us. We will die but we will die together, in the same blinding flash of life, holding each other on this tiny rock surrounded by darkness and stars.

After a series of life altering events that occurred throughout the entire 2023 (serious auto accident, death of a loved one, betrayal of my business partner, wife of 20 years divorcing me, sudden debt, legal trouble on false accusations), I fell into deep depression and has been of antidepressants for almost a year now.

Although I’ve gotten past the worst phase where I couldn’t even get out of bed, and even when I did, I just stared lifelessly at the TV, and spent most of my days planning on how to off myself, now to the point where I can begin to function, get back to work (I’m an entrepreneur and have my own small business), and live a life that mildly resembles that of my old one.

But I seem to have lost all motivation to do anything, It would take me literally hours, if not days to even write an email, and when I do, I would be mentally exhausted.  My brain would keep shouting “Just effing do it already!!!” Repeatedly and my body wouldn’t even budge the slightest and just kept on watching YouTube video after YouTube video.

And every night when I am in my bed, I could not stop beating myself up over doing nothing for the whole day, calling myself the nastiest of names just hoping I could shame myself into not repeating the same thing the next day, but to no avail, to the point I would bury myself in my pillow and just cry helplessly.

I just flunked out of college, I have no money to my name, no friends, no social life in general, hate absolutely everything about myself, etc. etc. I just kind of don't know what to do with myself anymore. I think the tipping point was dropping out. I was an engineering major for 4 years and still wasn't even able to get my associates. Call it laziness or idiocy. Who knows. But now I'm in debt with nothing to show for it. A few weeks ago I broke up with my ex because things aren't going well. And by that I mean that my parents absolutely HATE him. I'm tired of arguing it about. I'm tired of having to defend my partner. And the sole reason they hate him is the fact that he's an immigrant. And unless I marry him, I don't think he'll get papers anytime soon. But I'm scared. I don't think I'm ready to get married. It seems like a big commitment. I just wish I knew what to do with my life right now. I wish I could change my name and move to another city and start over. But I'm not capable of doing anything. I just feel like such a loser. I have nothing going for me. I struggle to find a reason to keep going. Anytime I try to do anything, it always comes out wrong. Nothing ever goes how I planned it. I really thought that when I graduated high school 4 years ago, everything would be better. I would try to be social. I would put in effort into my studies. I would try to be happy. But I've spent the last 4 years being miserable. I'm just tired of feeling this way. I can't remember the last time I've felt content with my life. Will it always be this way? I try to be better.

I think it&amp;#39;s the fact I have no one else to talk about this with. I just feel utterly lost at the moment. I just flunked out of college, I have no money to my name, no friends, no social life in general, hate absolutely everything about myself, etc. etc. I just kind of don&amp;#39;t know what to do with myself anymore. I think the tipping point was dropping out. I was an engineering major for 4 years and still wasn&amp;#39;t even able to get my associates. Call it laziness or idiocy. Who knows. But now I&amp;#39;m in debt with nothing to show for it. A few weeks ago I broke up with my ex because things aren&amp;#39;t going well. And by that I mean that my parents absolutely HATE him. I&amp;#39;m tired of arguing it about. I&amp;#39;m tired of having to defend my partner. And the sole reason they hate him is the fact that he&amp;#39;s an immigrant. And unless I marry him, I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;ll get papers anytime soon. But I&amp;#39;m scared. I don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m ready to get married. It seems like a big commitment. I just wish I knew what to do with my life right now. I wish I could change my name and move to another city and start over. But I&amp;#39;m not capable of doing anything. I just feel like such a loser. I have nothing going for me. I struggle to find a reason to keep going. Anytime I try to do anything, it always comes out wrong. Nothing ever goes how I planned it. I really thought that when I graduated high school 4 years ago, everything would be better. I would try to be social. I would put in effort into my studies. I would try to be happy. But I&amp;#39;ve spent the last 4 years being miserable. I&amp;#39;m just tired of feeling this way. I can&amp;#39;t remember the last time I&amp;#39;ve felt content with my life. Will it always be this way? I try to be better. I really do. But my emotions always get the better of me. I just wish I was someone else. Anyways, thanks for reading this.

I didn't know her, but she was really close to my best friend. we're all 24/25 y/o. she told us she was with her last night watching the match (we're from argentina) and that they were going to have dinner tonight, and now she's in the police station
she hanged herself in her house. and her dad found her

I'm wordless

i keep thinking why did she do it and not me? why if I didn't do it, she did? and how? how did she find out how to do it? what did she use? what was she thinking when preparing everything, and just before doing it?

i feel envy, confusion, i feel like I should've been the one doing it, i feel like a coward for some reason, i feel as if this happened to our group of friends, i feel as if i did it to my friends
i thought about the many many times my friends were scared about me and what could i do, i think about the moment my dad would found my body if i did it, how guilty he'd feel (i had major issues with my dad but we've been at peace for 3 or 4 years now)

it's horrible, it's a fucking nightmare and I'm so shocked and I don't know what to do with this overwhelming feeling
I couldn't stop crying before writing this

so many people died inbetween yesterday and today... one argentinian guy died just before the match, because he went to the obelisk to cheer, he climbed a thing there and then fell off it... he landed with his head

,depression,"Been together for just over 10 years. Husband was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when he was a teenager (Domestic violence). He's taking meds now. We've had couple's therapy from Dec to April this year.

Normally, he's an introvert, low energy but jokes around with me and communication is not an issue, very kind and mild person. If he's down, he plays some video games, watches some game videos he likes then he gets better.

The issue is when we argue about something. He either likes to blame me, and completely talking about his side. (If I focus on his side, he says something and I reply, no problem, we can communicate back and forth) But if I want to talk about my side after he's done his side, he either loses focus gets drowsy or even fall asleep, or tells me it's wrong, or calling me delusional or saying blaming me for making no sense, etc.)

Usually that gets me very frustrated and emotional then the argument gets more escalated and he either loses control calling for a divorce or leaves the house.

Today he took it out on me when the dog bit him. I said ""Don't take it out on me."" He started accusing me for not punishing the dog enough, etc. Anyways I tried to leave the conversation before it got bad. (I just said Don't talk to me until you're calm.)

In the past, i was the one that couldn't take the silence and always tried to make an nice gesture or apologize (I don't want to do that anymore. I'm so tired)

Could you help me?

1. What should i do?
2. Is his behavior depression related? (I've dealed with this issue for years and years and I'm so tired, but at the same time no other issue when we don't fight.

Husband was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when he was a teenager (Domestic violence). He&amp;#39;s taking meds now. We&amp;#39;ve had couple&amp;#39;s therapy from Dec to April this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, he&amp;#39;s an introvert, low energy but jokes around with me and communication is not an issue, very kind and mild person. If he&amp;#39;s down, he plays some video games, watches some game videos he likes then he gets better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue is when we argue about something. He either likes to blame me, and completely talking about his side. (If I focus on his side, he says something and I reply, no problem, we can communicate back and forth) But if I want to talk about my side after he&amp;#39;s done his side, he either loses focus gets drowsy or even fall asleep, or tells me it&amp;#39;s wrong, or calling me delusional or saying blaming me for making no sense, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

Everything in this world is a fucking joke and its affecting me in the worst way possible. I have descended into this state of being cold... I've become a cold hearted, emotionless husk that can only operate at work. Once I'm at home all i do is sit, game, eat or fantasize about a better life that is so out of reach. The feeling of daily paralysis and not being happy or content even existing is tiring. Sleep is too hard these days too. iv been awake for days just thinking. Not being able to feel emotion and feeling like there's nothing to do anymore in life but to work is just shit. Its cost me friends and is about to cost me my marriage.

Outside my 4 walls that i call home, i am continuously met with a society that cannot seem to accept one another. My very religious family is always out there to condemn every choice i ever make or have made in the past. Society is always trying to convert other people to their belief system whether that is religion, gender, political, socio-economical or even food related and the pressure of being confronted by that is just over exaggerated. Now don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their own choices regarding beliefs or gender identification but just stop laying it so thick on people especially people like me. i have had to deal enough with mental pressure/manipulation in my teenage years and now that i am almost 30 i have to continue battling my way through more mental pressure because other people cant handle the way you live your life? Absurd!

,depression,"I’m so tired of people. I’m of feeling alone and isolated from the people around me. The way they act is just so cold and almost automated. Like my family just treats me as normal as if I’m not a unique person as I see all of them. When I see problems they just look at things and say, “we’ll figure it out.” But never do. When I come home from work and no one says a word but will sit sound the dinner table and laugh and cut up for 2-3 hours. There been days where a slept almost all day until I had to go to work and no one checked up on me. There’s been weekends where I lost it in my room and I had breakdowns and panic attacks from just life and no one knew about it because no one bothered to every check up on me. Even though I check up on them all the time. Just to talk to them. I once attempted and though it failed, I was miserable for a month, I wore a jacket for obvious reasons but no one noticed or even asked about how I was doing. I would look at them sometimes for a solid 2 minutes just waiting for them to say something. But they never did. Whenever I go to them, they are always responsive but never reciprocate. Whenever someone else needs something or just wants to talk or hangout everyone is always there. They’ll invite people over or go places and just be as happy as can be. But yet I’m stuck here, in my room, in my mind wondering why all these years, I was treated as nonexistent. My friends are the same way. The friends I’ve had for 7+ years now. Sometimes we all get together and drink. In the last year or so, because how bad I’ve gotten, I always just hit it too hard. They would ask me why im drinking like a maniac. And of course in the beginning I would just say it helps or it’s been a rough month. Sooner or later they realized it was more when a rough month become the 12-13 rough months. Yet they always just acted as normal and never really bothered to check on me. Whenever we would talk and I would try to ask for help or tell them what’s going on they just tell me how good they’re doing or they would start hanging out without me and complain that I was bringing down the mood. They once told me they all had a hangout that I couldn’t be there for and collectively they told me I was the glue of the group, like the leader and who everyone looked up to, it felt good and I loved them for it. But now it’s like they moved on from me and don’t really care. Now instead of opening up when we drink I just lash out or make comments and they always ask why do I pull away and not share myself. Why do I not reach out if I really need them. I normally don’t say anything but it’s the same with my family. Im always there for them and I’ve always helped out but when I need something they seem to not be around. Like when(fake names for privacy reasons) Jared said he was hurting because his ex had passed away I was there to help him through it. I talked to him and helped him grieve. Or when Zach had family problems and I would give him advice and even come over and mediate talks with his mom. Or Sheen when he just had bad anxiety and I would come over and hang out with him, sooner or later they all worked through their problems or found solutions and im just left sitting here wondering when it’ll be my turn. When do I get to reach out and get help. You know who was there for me, my best friend in middle school who ended up taking his own life. One of my exes who I stayed closed with who O.D.ed. My best fucking friend in the whole wide world who lost to a disease. Among everything else that has happened in my life every-time I’ve needed the people I’m supposed to trust and care about, they always fall short no matter how good I am to them. I don’t like to talk about the dark things I have going about once when we all got wasted, we got into really heavy topics and I told them I really wanted to commit and they just said, “Aw man, don’t do that. Just live. Just do that instead.” At this point it’s not a matter of the stereotypical, I can’t take it, there’s nothing left for me. It’s the fact that I’ve come to my own personal realization that the world I came into doesn’t give 2 shits about me, the people around me have just pushed me out and don’t care about me, and the only place left that isn’t horrid and has people who want me to be are on the other side.

I feel cursed. I don't know how to explain but this is how I've been feeling for now 3 years.

I feel so depressed, helpless and misunderstood that I just lost hope this feeling will leave me for ever...

I've been depressed for 1 year as a 10 y.o because of bullying and other stuff. It was so bad that at a point I had suicidal thoughts on daily basis.
I escaped this horrible soul crushing feeling somehow... or so I thought.

On the last year of middle school the same feeling comes back but this time the situation was way different.

I had A LOT of people around me but only a few actual friends. Even though I was loved from a lot of people, I felt so so lonely...
To the point that it was getting hard to fake being happy.

The reason of that?? I DON'T KNOW!!!
I mean, I lived some tough things but I went through worse.
I tried to find the reason why but was unsuccessful and I still am...

These waves last for sometimes weeks but longest was 7 months (last year).

Last year I had a whole week where it felt like I was in a constant nightmare. I felt lost, extremely tired and kinda scared for some reason.

It's been 3 years since it came back and it's killing me inside. I feel like a hole in my chest and I can't fill it.

I wanna fill it with love but even that is too much to ask for, I somehow will end up ruining it like a lot of things.

I feel like I will never experienced real love, unconditional love, mutual love. Someone always ends up getting hurt.

I feel so lonely to the point it hurts physically, 
I hate that my mother sees me being sad, I can't even express all of this to her as it will result to nothing.

No matter how many times someone else says that I&amp;#39;m a good person or that I deserve more, I can&amp;#39;t understand it, I can&amp;#39;t internalize it, no, I refuse to do so. They don&amp;#39;t understand myself as well as I do, it&amp;#39;s just pity. Heh. Pity. I hate being pitied. Unfathomable and unreasonable hate. At this point I can&amp;#39;t remember what it felt like to be happy, I can&amp;#39;t really say I have been &amp;quot;happy&amp;quot;, only had moments of transient euphoria with the thought of crushing self loathing at the back of my head at all times. Forget happiness, I can&amp;#39;t even remember what happened these past few years, I&amp;#39;m always in a daze. Only thing I do is distract myself from the thoughts by consuming. Consuming anything. Content. Food. Anything. I wouldn&amp;#39;t say I&amp;#39;m sad, most of the time I feel nothing. Utter apathy. Devoid of a soul. However, there are times I breakdown. I shouldn&amp;#39;t have been born. How I wish someone else, anyone else was born in my place, in place of the scum that I am. My parents deserve a better son. My teachers deserve a better student. My sibling deserves a better brother. The world deserves a better person. I am utter trash. Worthless. Less than worthless, I make things worse. I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry I&amp;#39;m sorry. I don&amp;#39;t even know what I am sorry for. That&amp;#39;s a lie. I know what I am sorry for. I&amp;#39;m sorry for being a burden. I&amp;#39;m sorry for not being able to kill myself. I&amp;#39;m sorry for existing. I&amp;#39;m sorry. I&amp;#39;m sorry that I feel sad, I feel inconsolable grief, I shouldn&amp;#39;t feel that, it&amp;#39;s good that such a bad person like me suffers, but, it hurts. I&amp;#39;m sorry but it hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts so much. I don&amp;#39;t know if I want to be fixed or I even deserve to. I&amp;#39;m tired of living, tired of existing. I hope one day I close my eyes and never wake up and hope that that day will come soon. I won&amp;#39;t kill myself, probably, too much of a pussy to do so. But, it hurts. Please.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm currently at the hospital with a sister in law having a baby. Her whole family is her and their friends. My husband's family is very conservative and they always jab at us for being alternative / emo etc. (Also I'm sad I can't have a child right due to finances  now had a miscarriageast year around this time) so I'm on edge I guess. Trying to not cry. But I'm sitting here in the waiting room and I say to my husband's mom, ""I hope they let us babysit when she is more grown I'd love to."" They look at me like wtf no. I instantly try not to cry...

Then I'm talking about how if I have a kid I'd try to get on all fours because that's better and easier for the women, it's a more natural position than laying on your back.

A family friends goes, ""omg if you have a child it be like the exorcist""

Like wtf does that mean?
That I'd scream and cry cause yes I would obviously anyone should.
Or that I'd have a demon baby cause they are mad I'm not Christian conservative.

I feel I either die or go insane.There have been good moments in my life but im constantly reliving the bad.It started off when I was living in Georgia. My mom had got on drugs really bad when I was 4 years old and my sister was 6.I remember her and my dad always arguing bc of it.Waking up to mom holding a knife towards dad and then screaming at each other.It was every day and every night. Along with living in a bad environment constantly getting robbed,my parents allowed a homeless guy to live with us for a while and he would lock me and my sister in a room and beat us and cover my mouth. Just alot of bad shit. Until one night my dad had enough and I remember vividly him laying with me and my sister and telling us we were leaving in the morning to Kentucky to live with my grandparents.So the next morning we woke up,threw a bunch of shit in the car and left my mom.I can remember her chasing behind us and screaming not to leave. But my dad thought that would be the best thing to do for our lives. So we made it to ky and I met my grandparents. My grandpa was my dad and uncles step dad and my mamaw was their real mom. When we first got there it took a long time to warm up. My grandpa and grandma had to drag me and my sister out of the corner and I remember just screaming I hate you and I want to kill you and I didn’t even know them.so grandpa made me pick a switch. They were very strict.Eventually we warmed up to them and settled in.Dad stayed with us there. Not long after being there my dad had decided to take me and my sister to his friends down the road and they were all drinking and playing guitar. Having a good time. Til we all eventually headed outside on the porch and in the yard. Me and my sister stayed on the porch and was hitting a punching bag. And this is where the trauma in my life got worse. Nathan. My dads friend was very drunk and I remember him walking outside with his eyes closed with a shotgun barrel to his head. Faced towards me and my sister. And boom. I remember it all. My dad tried to calm us down and say that he accidentally shot himself in the leg. But that wasn’t true. He had killed himself right in front of us.A couple months pass since that and my mom starts calling my dad saying she’s off of everything and she’s doing better. So my dad tells me and my sister he is gonna be gone for a couple of days to pick mom up. I remember hugging him balling my eyes out saying please don’t leave please don’t leave.But he had to.But then a couple days go by and he’s not back. Papaw and mamaw say he’s spending time with our mom for a while. We were extremely sad but figured we would see him again. But no. December 13,2009. My Dad had picked my mom up and on the way back got into a fatal crash and died. My mom survived. The time we thought he was staying with mom in Georgia he was actually in a coma for 6 months.The day my grandpa told me he had picked me up from daycare and my sister from school. He said there was good news and bad news. He told us to choose one or the other. We both chose good news. He said our mom is back. But wouldn’t tell us the bad news until we got home.

Then one morning me and sissy woke up and she wasn’t here. She had abandoned us without even saying goodbye. So now my mom is back in Georgia. On drugs even worse and me and my sister are living with my grandparents.Fast forward 3 years. Im around 8 years old my sister is 10-11.We have already been through hell but that wasn’t all.I remember I was taking a shower cleaning myself. And when I get out I hear the door sling open. It’s my grandpa. I grab a towel and try to cover my body and hes just pulling it out of my hands trying to reveal me. He had a camera. He took multiple pictures of me naked and scared. And I’d rather not know what happened with them. He also molested my sister in many different ways. We didn’t realize what he had done until we got older. I was 13 and my sister brought up something he had done and it made me realize what he did to me. So we both decided to tell my uncle. My uncle told us not to confront him or anything and seemed like he believed us. The next day at school I told my cousin Audrey about it and she started balling here eyes out and it had gotten around to the office. Eventually I’m called to the office and one of my aunts are there to pick me up. She looks angry. As soon as I get in the car she asked me very irritated “What have you and Emma been making up about my Dad? We were in middle school and she instantly shut us down. My grandpa called us crazy the family believed it  and sent my sister off to an institution and when she got back my grandpa had molested her again and I backed down completely and said it was all a lie on my part because I thought they wouldn’t love me anymore and I wouldn’t have a family.My grandma had cancer during this time and died in 2013. The whole thing had blown over not long after and we were pretty much silenced.My sister came back eventually but always snuck out and tried to find ways to not be there. So it was Me my sister and papaw. Until my sister was 18 then she was out of there. So it was just me and my grandpa.And my mind had completely tuned out everything I guess for the best to keep my sanity and not kill him.I stayed with him as his health got worse and he had gotten dementia and his liver was failing. He started forgetting everything and defecating in the floors and I had to keep a baby monitor beside him in his room and one in mine. My aunts would sometimes come check on him and ask me how he was doing and they had me take care of him and clean him up and everything.He eventually got to the point he was stuck in a hospital bed in the living room right where my grandma passed. His days did not go on much longer and I got on pills in this part of my life so it was all just a bad time. He died not long after.So I moved into my aunt and uncles but ran away and stayed at a friends the majority of the time. Sissy had her own place now and gave birth to my nephew a couple years later. I was 17 atm. My mind Was and is now in a darker place. I don’t talk to any of my aunts and uncles anymore because of our past. I am now 20 and 4 months Ago my biggest nightmare became a reality. March 25th my sister is struck by a truck right down the road from her house and Died from the impact. She was texting me 3 days before on how she doesn’t want to be here anymore. And it was just a couple weeks after she had my other nephew. She was 22 years old and suffered most of those years from the things we witnessed together. My best friend and only person who could completely understand me. She got hit in the middle of the day and it hasn’t been announced if it was an accident or not yet. The people left are the ones who silenced us and our mom who abandoned us. Which I just recently moved her down here because she doesn’t have a car and she’s addicted pretty bad. It sucks that after all these years she can be here after my sister dies but I’m still the one that had to bring her here or it wouldn’t have happened . I have chosen to forgive her even though it’s hard. But everyone in my blood seems to get taken away tragically(my full blood aunt was also hit by a car in Georgia) and I fear death is coming after me next.

Either way I’m going insane and wish that me and my sister could have at least had a chance and wasnt mentally messed up from the start.Im trying not to bring destruction all around me from being so broken.

,depression,"I'm 17F. I used to cut a lot before I got caught. I have a ton of scars on one of my thighs. I was supposed to enter the military. But I learned that the military will never trust me to do important, well paying jobs even with a waiver. If they even let me in in the first place since people say it's a coin flip if they decide your good enough even with a self-harm waiver, getting a psych evaluation, and lying about being suicidal . 



My original depression was from a severe vitamin D deficiency. I felt numb and disgusting all the time with a heavy feeling in my heart. I cut to cope with something I didn't understand. I didn't know why I was depressed. After getting a prescription for Vitamin D, I stopped feeling depressed and forced myself to stop cutting even though it was a horrific addiction.



I have to go tell my parents, and they will be supportive of explaining why I can't enter the military. But it's so humiliating. I wanna fucking die. They were both in both the Amy and marines and said that the benefits of specifically the air force will lead me to a better life. But I ruined it. Because I cut. 



I feel numb again. My heart feels heavy and hurt. Breathing is hard with how tight my chest feels. I wanna cut so badly.

I used to cut a lot before I got caught. I have a ton of scars on one of my thighs. I was supposed to enter the military. But I learned that the military will never trust me to do important, well paying jobs even with a waiver. If they even let me in in the first place since people say it&amp;#39;s a coin flip if they decide your good enough even with a self-harm waiver, getting a psych evaluation, and lying about being suicidal . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original depression was from a severe vitamin D deficiency. I felt numb and disgusting all the time with a heavy feeling in my heart. I cut to cope with something I didn&amp;#39;t understand. I didn&amp;#39;t know why I was depressed. After getting a prescription for Vitamin D, I stopped feeling depressed and forced myself to stop cutting even though it was a horrific addiction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to go tell my parents, and they will be supportive of explaining why I can&amp;#39;t enter the military. But it&amp;#39;s so humiliating. I wanna fucking die. They were both in both the Amy and marines and said that the benefits of specifically the air force will lead me to a better life. But I ruined it. Because I cut. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel numb again. My heart feels heavy and hurt. Breathing is hard with how tight my chest feels. I wanna cut so badly. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"
i live on a closed and private urbanization of condos, and around 6:40 pm the group chat of the urbanization went crazy. people were asking to help someone and for someone to please call ambulance. that’s when i we (my parents and i) started hearing someone screaming outside.

this was a woman, she was crying hard. she was screaming: “please don’t let this be true”, “somebody please tell me that is a nightmare”, “please tell me that my daughter is well”. all the neighbors were around her trying to help. people called the police and the ambulance, she kept crying and screaming. 

after a few minutes a white car appeared and entered really fast until it came close to the woman screaming. it stopped abruptly and people got out of it. it was family of the girl and her mom.

people approached to the house. 

when the police came, they entered. i was talking to a neighbor who had more context of what was going on. it seems the girl already had some mental health problems. he told me that her mom entered the house but didn’t found her anywhere -the sad thing is, she’s a 27 year old that has a baby of 12 to 18 months i would say- she found the baby on the bed undressed (he’s okay) and the bathroom door locked. she started knocking on it but no answer. that’s when she realized what was going on and started to cry for help.

around that time the neighbor was telling me that, another of the neighbors happened to be a nurse, so when the police came, the nurse, a cop and a familiar of the girl went into the house. one of them went down and told us to please keep calling the ambulance; the girl seemed to don’t have any pulse.

they returned upstairs and a few minutes later the ambulance arrived. they came downstairs and statutes saying that she needed reanimation. minutes after, she regained pulse.

it seems she took pills, we don’t know how much and since how long.

they took her out of the house the ambulance runed away with her. that was at around 7:40 pm. we haven’t heard anything yet. (it’s 10:47 pm we i am)


this is the first time i experience this kind of situation and my head is spinning. hearing the mom screaming, watching her family rushing in, the police, the ambulance coming in and taking her out… but what striked me the most was watching her baby in the arms of her husband and thinking: how could you do that to him? (i don’t mean to judge) i felt so sad for that little boy… as i said she appeared to be alive when they took her away, i hope she is. i hope all the family is okay. i don’t know what she was going through but i hope she recovers and get to see her son and her husband.

if you are having thoughts or if you are in a bad place please seek help, please talk to somebody. there is people out there that loves you, even if you feel that there isn’t i can guarantee you that somewhere out there there is somebody that loves you. things will get worse before they start to get better, so please keep fighting, you’re gonna make it , you’re gonna pull through it, you’re gonna be okay, everything is gonna be okay.

,depression,"Broke up with my girlfriend of seven years about about 4 months ago. Seven was our special numbers so I was going to propose July. I feel as if I did it because I was depressed and I lost myself and I lost trust because I caught her lying so many times about silly things. Started to feel I lost us and we were arguing a lot and one day I just snapped. I have been regretting it.

Then lost my job, which I had a really great opportunity at, and it was purely due. The reason I was depressed from the break up, and I couldn’t get myself out of bed for a couple weeks. I feel like I’ve just been drinking and being sad and I’ve tried to eat healthy and go outside and be with people and I just felt depressed and sick like I’m not myself anymore.

I’ve always had depression, yet I’ve always dealt with it very well. I moved out of the house early on Was fairly successful. I don’t get the chance to visit my parents very much. I always knew my mom is a wine drinker but these past four years. I’ve slowly seen her basically kill herself with alcohol. This last year was just got really bad and I feel like I’ve already lost her. 

I’m a big mama boy I can’t even have a normal conversation with her anymore, she can’t walk, and she is starting get dementia from drinking so much. This Mother’s Day she called me by the wrong name and was totally out of it. Life has just been moving so fast. I feel like I didn’t even notice it and she was the best supportive mom growing up so I just don’t understand what happened. Recently, she asked me to go get a gun and kill her, and I didn’t I didn’t even know what to say and just left it just broke me. In and out of rehab have costed me and my dad so much and she just doesn’t wanna get better. I feel as if I’m gonna lose her any day now.

And then I had two friends commit suicide one last month, one this month and I had no idea if their struggles. The first you know was rough cause he had four kids so I just basically tried my hardest to help take care of everything for them, but it was a rough process. Then just last week my buddy shot himself and left a note which I was mentioned in. His mother asked me to write a eulogy for his funeral. This is his one of my close friends who I would come to you when I was down, and he was the best at working me through it. I couldn’t find the words, but I eventually did and I wrote it and then when it was time to go up and read it, I couldn’t even speak a word and had to have someone read it for me.

I have a lot of close friends that love me and then I can talk to, but for some reason, I am so embarrassed and have a hard time opening up other people I don’t want to see the weakness. I’ve always been really confident and I’ve just lost myself and I don’t really know who the fuck I am anymore. I’m only 25 years old and I feel like I dealt with my depression great with hobbies and staying busy. But this year has just crushed me and I don’t even know what to say or what to do. I started a new business which is going well and I have a second job so I’m helping out with a lot of family financial problems. Yet I hate myself and I hate my life, I feel I lost myself along time ago and now I just covered up with drugs.

It feels like rockbottom and that’s not even all of it. I’m trying to keep it short. I don’t know why I’ve came to myself so much and I’ve tried therapy, but I just filled so disconnected.

,depression,"I'm in my early 20s soon to begin the mid age, ever since I was 13 or 12'ish I knew this person who I cared about, I won't get deep into it but we have so much history together and we were super close and know a lot about each other, but I'll be honest, fuck this guy, entering adulthood I've tried be a supportive girlfriend when we dated, a supportive bestfriend when we broke off the relationship and came to terms with it, managing to still be good friends through in and through out. But fuck when it got tense it got tense, I don't feel right giving people space when they're upset (unless they state it themselves or hint it as best as they can without putting it into words) so I'd be the one to try and cheer him up as much as I could even if it really did seem like it never did much at all (though he'd tell me otherwise and say it would.) 

We hung out every day or almost every day for years, so it could get draining when either of us spiraled into a bad mood for whatever reason, yeah he'd try here and there but I'd say when it came to helping the other feel better I was good or at least, effortful when it came to it, I loved him so much just as the person he was regardless of his flaws and I looked passed his cold demeanor he'd put on sometimes. I am pretty much crying because I just dished out so much for this fucking guy who in the last moments of what I really do assume was our friendship, he couldn't look past me just being a fucking human and being overwhelmed with something we were working on together, I may have sucked at the communication bit but he got so fucking angry at me simply for just being overwhelmed? I tried man. 

Where he was lonely I tried introducing him to friends, where he was upset financially I'd offer him what advice I could offer that seemed realistic at best for what little experience I have with it. I admit at some point there was a falloff with how clingy I was with him and I admit to obviously being immature when we were younger but I have matured since then, so much so I'd say that maybe I am more mature than him, I recognize and don't blame people anymore for feeling emotions- the way he definitely-fucking-does, and maybe- this is just assuming on his side; he just didn't like seeing me become and grow into my own person- in the sense that I wasn't basically dependent on him for learning things and being the only friend I had because I eventually made new friends years later (I'd say, when I turned 22 I started opening up more etc) after being a loner aside from him being my only friend for practically my whole life and me living through abusive family trauma, plus a side dish of even more trauma outside of family for days on end; lasting for years which he definitely knows my life history because he was and I say without exaggerating- my other half, he knows more about me than my own mother probably does (that's how close we were.)

Anyways, some stuff went down between me and him last year that left a scar on our friendship, where he decided to disconnect from me and our mutual bestfriend at the time, the bridges he tried burning left me to drop being friends with that other friend shared between us. I missed him every day for months, but I tried looking past it to finish school because I wasn't gonna let people who left me hurting so much stop me from graduating; and just around the time I finished school, he had tried talking to me a few things for lesser important things, eventually I had managed to reconnect us as friends, and him opening up and reconnect with his other friends because he tried doing a self isolating thing, which I immediately recognized as destructive and unnecessary but still forgave him for it because I was not a stranger to doing self destructive things myself. 

Any who- yeah, I looked past it even though it was an awful time for me, we were friends as usual again etc. I thought everything was alright and maybe after that went down- I thought we learned to be more understanding basically of each other, but nope. Rewind to around May, me and him get the idea to work on something together, blah blah blah, I eventually start feeling extremely overwhelmed easily but I am afraid to let him know that, so instead of telling him how I feel I try and rub it off instead of talking to him (because, I have a history of being a people pleaser- I don't want to upset him) he eventually asks to talk to me about the thing we were working on, I tell him how I was feeling, he lets me know basically that he was frustrated with me, the conversation on his half feels colder, I thought we were just talking things out but nope, he lets me genuinely know that he really just frustrated with me when I thought he'd be understanding and not lash out at me for being overwhelmed as I have stated to him- multiple times, so I'm like- ""Ok, I will give you space, sorry."" at that point forward we are half ways done through May into June, he hasn't said a damn word to me while making it very obvious he is just doing literally anything else, I know his schedule too so like- ??? There would've been no fucking reason for him to cold shoulder me and give me the silent treatment since our argument in the middle of the month, I give it some deep thought like- ""Yeah- wow, I really fucked up he really just isn't talking to me at all."" 

I vent to my other friends that he just isn't talking to me so while I confide in my other friends for guidance and support; I actually let my other friends know if this guy doesn't talk to me into the next month of June, I'm just cutting him off because what's the point? I feel scolded for having emotions in a fun project that wasn't even taking off yet and was really just in discussion phase. There was nothing being lost yet- at least to me; though in our argument he pointed his finger at me and said some shit like ""You have an income; I don't"" so I guess I was actually obligated to work on it with him or something, even though I tried being there for this guy while he tried looking for a job and shit though that never went anywhere. Lol... alright man. Anyways, it's pretty much June now, I just let him know what's what, I leave him with the details of our project because he just seemed more passionate about it than I was at this point and I just cut him off because this guy was just so fucking unforgiving, I think to myself that that's it- and a side of relief but also a hint of shame, that shame grew because I didn't feel right carving him out of my life but I really didn't know what else to do when the guy who I cared so much about didn't talk to me for the rest of the month of May.  Skip to a few days ago where I reached out to just talk to each other, see if maybe we can just hear each other's side. At this point I don't expect anything anymore, other than to just hear it out and MAYBE be understanding, but I don't even think that happened. I feel like all these years were genuinely wasted because in my newer closer friendships, I just can't give as much enthusiasm and care that I gave to this one person who I considered my other half. All the hours and attention and care and support I definitely fucking gave feels like it was going into a garbage chute with nothing to gain but shitty compost- in other words. I feel like this guy just left me with nothing but hot steamy shit on my chest. It is my friends birthday today (the one I met around Christmas), (not the guy who I've been venting about) but I feel like I just couldn't provide enough celebration and positive attention to him because I feel just a dark cloud of depression looming over me right now. I feel like shit man, I can't win no matter where I think I'm getting better I'm really not, I want to cry so fucking much, so many years of expending so much energy on this guy. I don't know if me and him will ever pick back up to the spot we were in before the project when we were good friends with each other. I'm too much of a people pleaser to be thinking about someone who cold shouldered me for half the month of May and never was understanding about what \*\*I\*\* was dealing with or HAVE dealt with when I gave him basically all I could ever offer another person.

But fuck when it got tense it got tense, I don&amp;#39;t feel right giving people space when they&amp;#39;re upset (unless they state it themselves or hint it as best as they can without putting it into words) so I&amp;#39;d be the one to try and cheer him up as much as I could even if it really did seem like it never did much at all (though he&amp;#39;d tell me otherwise and say it would.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We hung out every day or almost every day for years, so it could get draining when either of us spiraled into a bad mood for whatever reason, yeah he&amp;#39;d try here and there but I&amp;#39;d say when it came to helping the other feel better I was good or at least, effortful when it came to it, I loved him so much just as the person he was regardless of his flaws and I looked passed his cold demeanor he&amp;#39;d put on sometimes. I am pretty much crying because I just dished out so much for this fucking guy who in the last moments of what I really do assume was our friendship, he couldn&amp;#39;t look past me just being a fucking human and being overwhelmed with something we were working on together, I may have sucked at the communication bit but he got so fucking angry at me simply for just being overwhelmed? I tried man. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where he was lonely I tried introducing him to friends, where he was upset financially I&amp;#39;d offer him what advice I could offer that seemed realistic at best for what little experience I have with it. I admit at some point there was a falloff with how clingy I was with him and I admit to obviously being immature when we were younger but I have matured since then, so much so I&amp;#39;d say that maybe I am more mature than him, I recognize and don&amp;#39;t blame people anymore for feeling emotions- the way he definitely-fucking-does, and maybe- this is just assuming on his side; he just didn&amp;#39;t like seeing me become and grow into my own person- in the sense that I wasn&amp;#39;t basically dependent on him for learning things and being the only friend I had because I eventually made new friends years later (I&amp;#39;d say, when I turned 22 I started opening up more etc) after being a loner aside from him being my only friend for practically my whole life and me living through abusive family trauma, plus a side dish of even more trauma outside of family for days on end; lasting for years which he definitely knows my life history because he was and I say without exaggerating- my other half, he knows more about me than my own mother probably does (that&amp;#39;s how close we were.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, some stuff went down between me and him last year that left a scar on our friendship, where he decided to disconnect from me and our mutual bestfriend at the time, the bridges he tried burning left me to drop being friends with that other friend shared between us. I missed him every day for months, but I tried looking past it to finish school because I wasn&amp;#39;t gonna let people who left me hurting so much stop me from graduating; and just around the time I finished school, he had tried talking to me a few things for lesser important things, eventually I had managed to reconnect us as friends, and him opening up and reconnect with his other friends because he tried doing a self isolating thing, which I immediately recognized as destructive and unnecessary but still forgave him for it because I was not a stranger to doing self destructive things myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any who- yeah, I looked past it even though it was an awful time for me, we were friends as usual again etc. I thought everything was alright and maybe after that went down- I thought we learned to be more understanding basically of each other, but nope. Rewind to around May, me and him get the idea to work on something together, blah blah blah, I eventually start feeling extremely overwhelmed easily but I am afraid to let him know that, so instead of telling him how I feel I try and rub it off instead of talking to him (because, I have a history of being a people pleaser- I don&amp;#39;t want to upset him) he eventually asks to talk to me about the thing we were working on, I tell him how I was feeling, he lets me know basically that he was frustrated with me, the conversation on his half feels colder, I thought we were just talking things out but nope, he lets me genuinely know that he really just frustrated with me when I thought he&amp;#39;d be understanding and not lash out at me for being overwhelmed as I have stated to him- multiple times, so I&amp;#39;m like- &amp;quot;Ok, I will give you space, sorry.&amp;quot; at that point forward we are half ways done through May into June, he hasn&amp;#39;t said a damn word to me while making it very obvious he is just doing literally anything else, I know his schedule too so like- ??? There would&amp;#39;ve been no fucking reason for him to cold shoulder me and give me the silent treatment since our argument in the middle of the month, I give it some deep thought like- &amp;quot;Yeah- wow, I really fucked up he really just isn&amp;#39;t talking to me at all.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I vent to my other friends that he just isn&amp;#39;t talking to me so while I confide in my other friends for guidance and support; I actually let my other friends know if this guy doesn&amp;#39;t talk to me into the next month of June, I&amp;#39;m just cutting him off because what&amp;#39;s the point? I feel scolded for having emotions in a fun project that wasn&amp;#39;t even taking off yet and was really just in discussion phase. There was nothing being lost yet- at least to me; though in our argument he pointed his finger at me and said some shit like &amp;quot;You have an income; I don&amp;#39;t&amp;quot; so I guess I was actually obligated to work on it with him or something, even though I tried being there for this guy while he tried looking for a job and shit though that never went anywhere.

,depression,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m desperate for help and advice regarding my partner's severe depression. We’ve been together for 5 years, and while their depression and suicidal ideation have been mostly manageable, things have recently taken a steep downward spiral. Their suicidal thoughts are now constant, and we are in a state of crisis.

They have been switching medications, but nothing seems to be working. This has led to multiple trips to the ER, and we are desperate to find a medication that will provide some relief or at least a glimmer of hope. Unfortunately, inpatient treatment isn’t an option due to a previous terrible experience they had (the psychiatrist repeatedly forgot their prescriptions, they were exposed to other patients having meltdowns, and overall, it made things worse).

We live together, and they don’t have many friends they can lean on. I work full-time remotely, but I’m running on fumes trying to take care of them, maintain my job, and care for our pets. They have daily panic attacks and meltdowns, and I feel like I’m reaching my breaking point. Despite this, my instinct is to continue supporting them, as it feels like their life depends on me being there for them.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you cope and what steps did you take to help your partner? Any advice, resources, or just words of support would be greatly appreciated.

,depression,I dont know. My heads pretty messed up lately. Im still in high school but actually moves schools in November 2023. My old school was a really good school but was far from my house. I was pretty popular there and it was fun to be there and just overall a great experience. I had made quite a few close and loyal friendships and life was good. This all changed when i moved schools. Now my new school is in Centrale London whereas the last one was Kent. two VERY different places. My new school is a state school. My old school was a grammar school. Now i moved because of the travelling issue as my dad had to drive one hour to get to school. Now to my new school i just take a train. Now one thing is that the school is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy smaller than my old school. it makes things feel cramped and congested all the time and i have nowhere to breathe. although the drugs/vapes/smoking/pollution in the air doesnt really help either. Just to say but my school is a whole year academically behind. Ive been TRYING to study hard but that is hard to do as ive gained a new sense of laziness. Ive been making no friends as everyone in the school is just toxic and i mean TOXIC. The downright play their own friends and insult them with no filter ofr apologie or even a 'im just kidding'. It just makes you feel like sh1t. Ive been constantly stomped on and made fun of by my cleassmates even though i do litterally nothing and try not to draw attention to myself and i envy the kids who arent brought to the topic of the conversations.

,depression,"I have to be the most empty person on the planet.

It’s a long story to how I got to this point, but I was extremely selfish and lazy as a child, and completely lacked any social skills (still fail in that regard)

I had zero real friends in middle and high school since I was so easily angered and couldn’t even initiate a conversation, I lacked any and all empathy for others, and due to my after school job in my last two years, I couldn’t do any extracurricular activities.

Sadly, I completely wasted my college years feeling scared I wasn’t going to pass for every moment of every day, and barely ever did anything else but cope behind a screen alone when I wasn’t studying. The pandemic really put me into this habit, and I sadly never got out of it. I had zero friends and wasn’t able to get any experience. I literally cried out of hopelessness during my graduation ceremony a year ago, and had to move back in with my parents. I was unemployed for months until finally getting a full time beginner job, which I now can’t stand, and I have completely lost interest in my major (i already felt such way during my final year of college)

It’s been slightly a year since my graduation, and my attention span for any sort of productivity is so low that I just spend any time out of work crying and feeling empty thinking about how I messed up so badly.

A few weekends ago, I came to a full realization about how everything went so wrong and have told myself I will change, but since then I haven’t even been able to put in the effort to find someone to help me.

,depression,"I don’t see myself not being lonely and depressed. 

I’m 24 with a college degree in history looking for a paraprofessional job so I can get my master and be a teacher. Right now I’m in summer and I’ve been out of high school for 6 years. I work at Wendy’s and the para jobs are not calling back. My mental health is horrible. I smoke weed to mask the pain and depression. I have absolutely no one except family. I want a girlfriend but nope I can’t find one anywhere. I broke up eight years ago my only girlfriend and she found a boyfriend and she has been going out with him for a long time now and I’m just stuck going to work and fishing and hanging with my dogs. I feel left out of everything. I’m always the second choice or whatever. My phone is always dry. My “friend group” really isn’t my friend group. I haven’t texted them in MONTHS and I have not heard a peep at all. Like I always have to text first. I never ever fucking fit in to any group. I’m always a fucking outcast. I get paid shit money. My Wilke family get paid more then me and I have a fucking degree. My dad and sister don’t. Like what the fuck is wrong with my life. I hate life. I have so much fucking debt. I can’t afford shit. I just needed to vent. If you have any tips I would love to hear them because I’m lost as fuck and lonely as hell. No one ever like my fb post. I never get any matches.

&lt;p&gt;I’m 24 with a college degree in history looking for a paraprofessional job so I can get my master and be a teacher. Right now I’m in summer and I’ve been out of high school for 6 years. I work at Wendy’s and the para jobs are not calling back. My mental health is horrible. I smoke weed to mask the pain and depression. I have absolutely no one except family. I want a girlfriend but nope I can’t find one anywhere. I broke up eight years ago my only girlfriend and she found a boyfriend and she has been going out with him for a long time now and I’m just stuck going to work and fishing and hanging with my dogs. I feel left out of everything. I’m always the second choice or whatever. My phone is always dry. My “friend group” really isn’t my friend group. I haven’t texted them in MONTHS and I have not heard a peep at all. Like I always have to text first. I never ever fucking fit in to any group. I’m always a fucking outcast. I get paid shit money. My Wilke family get paid more then me and I have a fucking degree. My dad and sister don’t. Like what the fuck is wrong with my life. I hate life. I have so much fucking debt. I can’t afford shit. I just needed to vent. If you have any tips I would love to hear them because I’m lost as fuck and lonely as hell. No one ever like my fb post. I never get any matches.

Besoin de parler du vécu qui est actuellement en train d'arriver et n'arrive plus à surmonter

Pour résumer ma situation j'ai 36 ans une compagne de 36 ans également avec qui nous sommes fusionnel, une entreprise de 7 salariés avec un salaire confortable, une vie simple d'entrepreneur qui roulait parfaitement 

Mais il y a 2 mois tout c'est écroulé subitement, mon activité c'est brutalement stoppé, l'administration m'ayant retiré les autorisations me permettant de travailler... et tout cela à cause notamment de MES propres erreurs et prise de décisions catastrophique 

Ne pouvant quasi plus travailler j'ai malheureusement dû licencier le personnel et doit faire face à de multiples problèmes : procédure judiciaire en cours, forte amende (en centaine voir millions d'euros), licenciement des salariés, prison mais vraisemblablement sursis, contrôle fiscal j'ai fais que de la merde avec ma société, impossibilité de payer les charges à venir, liquidation judiciaire, faillite personnel... Bref une erreurs que que je risque de payer toute mon existence

Depuis ma vie est devenu un véritable enfer, je vis dans le stress permanent; je ne dors plus que sous Stilnox et sous Lexomil, je n'ai plus le goût à rien, je suis en dépression sévère et n'ai que des idées noirs...

Je passe mon temps à ruminer, me dire que j'aurais dû faire ci faire ça, comment j'en suis arrivé là, j'en veux à tout le monde alors que le seul fautif est MOI MEME

J'ai perdu toute la confiance et complicité que j'avais avec ma compagne (l'une des rares chose qui me rendait heureux), nous allons perdre notre maison notre sécurité financière et surtout notre amour qui ne survivra certainement pas à cette épreuve

,depression,"It’s like a repeating pattern in my life. It’s so predictable I can write a step-by-step guide.

Someone befriends me, I get attached, then they ask for (what seems to me at the time like) a small favour. I do the favour, the person likes the results, so they ask for another favour a little bit bigger than the last one. I do it, they like the results again, then they ask again because they know I’m not going to say no. They know I’ll do it because “they’re my friend, of course I’ll help them”.

This happens over and over until I finally realize what’s going on. When the time comes, I express my concerns to them nicely. They act like it’s no big deal, like they understand and will change. I believe they will change, because they’re my friend. So I become blind to them continuing with the same old behaviour until I realize and talk to them again. Repeat this step a few times.

When it gets to the point where I’ve finally had enough, I express my concerns to them again, this time leaving no room for alternative interpretation. Then they gaslight me, act like they’ve been reasonable and I’m the crazy one, then actively go out of their way to avoid me for a bit.

If they know even the slightest thing about my mental health, they also act like it’s because of that too.

Is it really crazy or make me mentally unwell to not want to be treated like a soccer ball? Because that’s what I feel like. I feel like I’ve been kicked and passed around by all these people for various reasons, them all knowing what I’m like and that I don’t know how to say no.

The depth of my sadness knows no bounds, yet it feels hypocritical, as I have never faced true loss, never had to go hungry, beg, or feel violated. There are so many good things in my life, yet I am unable to be grateful for them. Only when I lose them do I understand how much I care and how much they mean to me. And I always lose them.

I am never able to express my love and affection for the people who stood by me in the darkest times. I fail to treasure them and respect their value. I lie here sad and broken, fully aware that I have hurt people terribly. Though I might not have done it intentionally, I did nothing to stop it. I've made decisions and choices for which there is no one to blame but myself. I have always hurt people, leaving them disappointed and sad. I can't think of one relationship in my life where this hasn't happened. I have hurt myself too, making terrible decisions that led to many mistakes.

I feel like I have not achieved anything in my life. Even now, I am afraid I am indulging in self-pity. This terrible feeling of sadness, guilt, shame, regret, and loneliness just does not seem to go away. And why would it? I have not been a good son, brother, friend, family member, or boyfriend. I have failed both in my personal and professional life. I lie here heartbroken, knowing I have caused so much pain and suffering.

I have hurt someone I truly love, and I don't know how to feel bad, because it is not me who suffered because of my actions. Now, I am alone, having broken all relationships. I don't have a friend to talk to or a girlfriend to share my heart with. The loneliness feels like a huge weight on me, one that I can't shed no matter what I do. I have not treated myself right. I have been undisciplined, inconsistent, and careless about myself, the people in my life, my feelings, and my life. I have chased impulsivity and short-term gratification.

I have not respected others or taken care of them because I have not respected or taken care of myself. Sometimes, I wish I could just fulfill all my responsibilities and make my parents happy, because after that, I might be able to end the suffering completely. Because I cannot take much of this anymore.

,depression,"I am in my thirties and was diagnosed with severe depression on december, 2023. What broke me and made me go to the psychiatrist was that my ideation day failed, not for mental reasons. I couldn't work, eat and for the first time in my life I felt lonely.

I am on meds since then. In march I felt really good, never in my whole life I felt so good, could think better, talk better, could describe if food was good or bad, and for the first time I had a moment in my life that I could describe as happiness. I was able to go do lots of exams (bloos test), everything is good. Walked for 4 hours in one day. Wrapped a birthday gift for my best friend. Could describe how good or bad a food was, never been a picky eater. Went out with all my friends. Was able to do 6 sets of all my workout routine everyday in 1 hour, 12 exercises divided in 3 supersets. Cleaning my whole house was easy.

The best expression to explain it was cloud nine.

One month later, things got worse again. Less energy, harder to concentrate and think, harder to do basic things, crying more, went to 6 sets everyday to 3 sets and then 1, and somedays I wasn't able to workout. I go out with my friends and feel nothing, on that stage that no one wants to see that I am not good, so I just pretend that things are okay.

Doctor increased meds and changed to ""stronger"" and expensive meds. It has been 3 months and It didn't get better. Some weeks ago someone recomended L Citrulline and helped a bit, but not extraordinary.

I am losing my hope, I feel that the ""feel good phase"" wasn't normal and I will never experience it again. I am currently off work since december, not receiving any money from my country social service. I will run out of money in some months, and planing a date again.

I am posting this because in my lurking experience here and on other social medias, I have never seen anyone describe that feel good moment that lasted only days or weeks.

It's hard to explain what I mean. Lately they've spent a lot of money on a summer math course and Invisalign for me. I'm talking like thousands.

I 33f am married to 37m
We have a little one.

We have been together 11 years.

In the beginning it was great, I was happy, I was in love.

Shortly after having our daughter I developed pretty bad PPD and tried to get help but the meds just made me worse.

We moved far away from family and I was left alone dealing with PPD and an infant 16 hours a day, every day.

During this time living across the country from family, he abused me. It was only the one time, but it’s stayed with me ever since. 

Fast forward to today and I have basically been raising “our” child alone for the past 8 years. I work, but I also do all the work of a SAHM. My child even comes to work with me (which I am grateful was even an option as childcare is not cheap so this was a financial relief.)

I have chronic depression. My earliest memory of me having depression I was 4.
I also over the years developed anxiety and CPTSD from sexual assault.
I go to a trauma therapist and yes it’s working, but I have a lot to work through. My husband knows this and yet provides me no help or relief from my every day tasks.

I cook dinner, he does not. So the trade was he’s to do dishes. They’ll sit in the sink for days, and if I complain, I’m the asshole.

Suddenly our child has started having bouts of severe anxiety and it’s been hard to handle as I cannot get through to her to help her. 
I set up both a doctors appointment and therapy for her. Again, with no input or help from my husband.

Last night as soon as it was bedtime my child started having bad anxiety.
Now I also have a chronic illness that causes me to be in full body pain and aches pretty much 24/7 and it makes me exhausted.  
So when she started I myself started to break down.

I have so much on my shoulders. I do everything for my child, husband, our pets, the home, and I put myself last because I have no other choice.

I got up and went to get my laundry and saw that the stuff I just treated myself to was covered in black ink from a pen my husband left in his pants. And I lost it. It was the straw that broke the camels back.

I had a full on mental break and panic attack.

My husband’s way of consoling me?
“Knock it off and stop fucking up her (out daughter) life!”

I couldn’t believe it. I could not believe he said that to me. After everything I have done and sacrificed for him and our family.
(And for context my daughter is absolutely attached at the hip to me, not him.) it was one of the most hurtful things he’s ever said to me, especially since he knows that with my own mental health I already feel I’m a POS mom for being depressed 24/7

I don’t want to be alive anymore, but I also can’t do that to my baby. The guilt comes in heavy with the mere idea of offing myself because of how often my husband has called me selfish for even having those thoughts as a parent.

I know I of course didn’t give you our full history, but that’s the gist of our relationship. I have retaliated against his words and actions towards me and he knows exactly what to do to gaslight me into insanity.

I want to just leave and start a new life and be in a better head space with my baby, but I financially don’t know how I’d even do that. I also have no family to turn to.

I am struggling massively with my mental health, to the point of just feeling exhausted and not present, I’m worn out and just done with everything, especially my job. I’m just feeling so lost and a failure in life and it weighs on me.

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for years now, but I’m very high functioning and very good at hiding it,so on the outside, I look perfectly ok, but I just feel like I’m unrevealing now and I don’t even know where to begin to pick up the pieces. I’ve e had counselling and CBT which helped but I still struggle so deeply, I’ve never had medication, I don’t know what to do. My GP is aware of my struggles and put me on the waitlist for NHS talking therapy, but I still on the list.

I dread my job, I work in the public sector/local government in education so it’s very high pressure, heavy caseload. I’ve handed in my notice which is 3 months from now, so I will be leaving soon. I’m going to take a break from working and just focus on my studies and pursue my masters degree, so I haven’t completely left without something lined up.

A family member of mine passed away and that triggered it even further.

There is no signposting to services that can help at my workplace, there is no ‘how can I help,’ nothing. She isn’t mean, but I dread engaging with her about it.

It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion.

,depression,"I've written this post twice now after taking too long and losing it.  I'm going to be as brief as possible, while still trying to cover everything.  Mainly the advice I need is at the end.

I've been with my (46M) girlfriend (36F) for 3 and a half years.  I haven't been a good boyfriend.  I've lied about some pretty big things, and I've compounded lie on top of lie.  I was previously married in a loveless and toxic marriage that I am still struggling to end, but I lied to her and told her that it was final.  When she asked to see the decree, I continued to lie, delaying the inevitable. She knows now, and even though the divorce arbitration is moving forward, it doesn't fix the lies.

I had a close friendship with someone from my previous job, that was inappropriate.  Really inappropriate.  It wasn't cheating, physically or emotionally, neither of us wanted anything like that, but we did exchange racy and sexual text messages with each other, memes and pornographic pictures from the internet, nothing ever personal, and some of this did overlap into the beginning of my relationship with my girlfriend.  My girlfriend found out and I deleted all the messages from my phone, out of shame, and fear, and disgust with myself.  I forgot that they were even there because it had been so long ago, but once she found one of them, it all came back and I panicked.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to restore them so she can read them all and get closure.

We are trying to work things out, I think most of the work needs to be done by me.  I am in therapy, both personal and couples', trying to be better.  My psychologist wants to diagnose me with Borderline Personality Disorder, but I'm not sure that completely explains everything.  It's a work in progress.  I just want to move forward and I don't want to lie ever again, and I want everything to go back to normal.

That's where the anxiety is.  I overthink and I self-punish.  I go from 0 to 1000 at the drop of a pin and I am inconsolable.  I am terrified that I'm losing her, that I have already lost her, that she's going to find someone else less problematic.  And part of me knows that that probably would be the best thing for her, to be loved by someone that would never lie or hurt her.  It would end me though.  It would completely destroy me.  She tells me that she still loves me, and still wants to be with me, and make this work, but she can never trust me again.  Even if we work through all this, I can't see how she ever could, and I don't blame her.  Not one bit.  And without trust, how can there be love?  Real love?  And in my head, I don't know if she really needs ME or does she just need someone, and am I in the way?  She wants to meet new people, for friendships and I agree that she should.  I think she should get out and find that support system that I'll never be comfortable finding for myself.  She says that she's not looking for dates, or someone new, or even casual throwaway sex to fill the void that I caused, but that fear exists.  I know how special she is, even if she doesn't, and I know other people will see it too.  And I'm going to lose her, if I haven't already.

We have ups and downs.  Some days we are still madly in love and all over each other physically.  Some days are the complete opposite, cold, quiet, filled with hurt.  It's the yo-yo that hurts the worst, and causes the most anxiety.  Waiting for the shoe to drop that she found someone.  That it already happened.  And it's over.  It eats at me inside and I can't seem to make it stop.  I go for days without eating or drinking, sleeping.  I've lost over 15 pounds in two weeks and my clothes don't fit anymore. I just don't know how to stop accelerating things in my own mind, or how to stop hurting myself and focus on trying to fix the here and now.  I was on Paxil 10mg once a day for a while, but they don't work and I'm pill avoidant anyway.  I don't know what to do and I need help and I feel like I don't deserve any.

,depression,"I don’t know how to put this into words but here’s what I’m dealing with:

Severe Misophonia, chronic back pain(unknown cause, dozen of unsuccessful treatments over the course of about 7 years), severe social anxiety- literally zero friends whatsoever, religious disagreement with family, frequent headaches, depression, (thankfully mild most of the time, except every week or so when I get lonely and it smacks me in the face and tells me I have nothing of value to offer to anyone and no future) and no life skills/degree or employment of any kind.

 I have also never had sex/kissed/held hands/been on a date in my life. I can literally only think of one time a girl my age even hugged me.  It was about 7 years ago (when my life was just starting to fall apart) and she only hugged me because she was a very friendly/affectionate kind of person and we happen to be in the same group at Mormon youth conference thing (she hugged everyone goodbye). We barely ever spoke to each other and I don’t even remember her name. 

I have plenty to be thankful for too, or at least I *should* be, but somehow that just makes me feel like I’m even more useless for not being able to get my life together. Anyway the positives are:

Parents (still married and in a good relationship) are supportive with my struggles, other than the religion thing. They’re VERY Mormon/LDS and cannot accept that I don’t believe anymore. (I stopped at around 16).

I managed to get my driver’s license and GED after dropping out of school in 10th grade.(due to the back pain and misophonia)

Good financial situation. Of course I’m completely dependent on my parents(which makes me feel worthless sometimes) while we’re not exactly rich, we’re probably middle to maybe upper middle class, by the standards here in the US. 

Depression is also not quite as bad as it was at 16-17, in large part due to therapy. 

The thing is, all my problems compound on each other. 
Want to get a job? Well I can’t because my back is going to demand I lay down after 30 minutes of sitting, standing or walking. But why try when it’s going to send my anxiety through the roof? And what is someone triggers my misophonia, so I just sitting there, suffering with extreme rage, while my body pumps me full of all the hormones it thinks I need to be prepared for my imminent death?

So what if I work from home then? How many jobs are there that let me work as few and as erratic hours as I need to manage the pain, while also minimizing social interaction? Oh and all I have for my resume is a GED and zero previous employment. 

How do I make friends when I have nowhere to go? No school, college, church or workplace. Not to mention I live in the dead center of the mormoniest part of Utah. I’m instantly going to be an outsider, as an agnostic-ish person. I’m not even anti-Mormon or looking to get into arguments or anything. People aren’t mean about it, but there’s always that slight distance between us.(which my social anxiety insists will ruin everything)

What about friends online? I have had some people I played online games with in the past, and had some I would call friends. But they didn’t last. Like all of my other friendships, they were shallow, I think because I suck at taking interest in other people, and we drifted apart. 

That’s only half the problem though, because my mom dislikes online game relationships . I’m not forbidden from playing games with people online, and she has actual agreed that it could be good for me to interact with people like that. The thing is, I have no privacy. Most of the day, it’s just me and my mom in the house, where she could overhear anything I say, or walk in at any moment. It’s not like I plan on doing anything she would disapprove of, but my anxiety doesn’t care. Even now, if she walks into the room while I’m just watching a harmless youtube video my heart rate spikes. So anytime I try to play online games with people there’s this stress that my mom is listening to and judging everything I say. Not to mention it’s just awkward to have your mom there while you’re trying to hang out with your friends.

The religion thing is at a stable but mutually unsatisfying stalemate. It makes interacting with my siblings awkward, and I usually avoid my extended family as best I can. My parents occasionally preach to me a little and everyday I have to read a page of the Book of Mormon and come to family prayer. I put up with it because they made it clear that those are the rules in this house and I figured it’s the least I can do considering how much they’ve worked to try to help me, not to mention raising me. 

The thing is, I sometimes hate it here. I hate living in this beautiful house with loving parents, free food, free WiFi and minimal responsibilities. I want to do something. I don’t know what because I’m not good at anything and every time I leave I am rewarded with physical and emotional suffering. I’m so socially defunct that I can’t hold a conversation with anyone, not that I get many opportunities to. But even being very inverted I get really lonely when I learn something cool and have no one to share it with, or when I need advice and have no one who can relate to me or when I realize that on my current trajectory, I’ll never fall in love, let alone get married and start a family. 

I’m not sure why I’m posting this, I guess it’s easier to be honest if I’m anonymous. I’ve thought about doing something like this before but I was paranoid that someone I know will find it and know it was me. I am still paranoid, but once I actually wrote this out I decided to just post it anyway. I don’t know if I want pity or advice, or just some actual meaningful human interaction, but every year that passes it gets harder to ignore the fact that I have no idea what I am going to do with my life.

I just feel dead. I've been so depressed these last few days. I just want to die. I can't think of any good reason to keep going. Life is not worth it at all. I'm so tired, can't stay motivated or see a reason to bother with much of anything.

I hate this life. Modern life is absolutely soul sucking and barbaric. I feel as though nobody cares about me at all and it's mostly true outside of family.

There really is nothing you can do. I'm going to therapy but that's doing nothing. I'm so emotionally numb to everything now.

I'm tired of the platitudes and false hope and people saying life is worth it because life is fucking unbearable.

,depression,"It happened yesterday morning. We have been together 3-4 months and everything’s been amazing, it’s not often I find a connection with someone. 
The past week or she has been struggling with depression, she has been noticeably struggling with needing space and I given it to her whenever she asks and however much she needs. It always ends with her wanting to be near me and holding her.
A couple days ago she had a tough day and really opened up to me and I listened and told her I was there there for. She kept saying how amazing and grateful she was to have me as a boyfriend.
Yesterday morning she woke up and we talked on the phone about meeting up because we had plans and she wanted to see me, her words, but after a few minutes when we’re gettting ready and her kitten just pooped on her carpet she started spiraling about she didn’t wanna drive and that I deserved better and that she’s bringing me down and destroying my life. Eventually we broke up but I made sure she knew I disagreed. 
We agreed to meet up next weekend to exchange stuff.

We have been together 3-4 months and everything’s been amazing, it’s not often I find a connection with someone. 
The past week or she has been struggling with depression, she has been noticeably struggling with needing space and I given it to her whenever she asks and however much she needs. It always ends with her wanting to be near me and holding her.
A couple days ago she had a tough day and really opened up to me and I listened and told her I was there there for. She kept saying how amazing and grateful she was to have me as a boyfriend.
Yesterday morning she woke up and we talked on the phone about meeting up because we had plans and she wanted to see me, her words, but after a few minutes when we’re gettting ready and her kitten just pooped on her carpet she started spiraling about she didn’t wanna drive and that I deserved better and that she’s bringing me down and destroying my life. Eventually we broke up but I made sure she knew I disagreed. 
We agreed to meet up next weekend to exchange stuff. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi, good morning/afternoon/evening. I'm writing this post to ask for your opinion on my behaviour.

For some months I've been taking SSRIs (Serotonin Recapture Inhibitors) which help me control my mind and depressive thoughts. The ones I take work really well. Although I need to give it a psychological push to keep working sometimes, but that's expected.

Now, I had to stop taking it because of ""reasons"", and my brain has slowly become depressed again, and although I feel sad and depressed more easily, I also feel more... Free, I feel like I am the real me, I feel like I'm really feeling, I'm really in touch with my own feelings and don't feel the need force myself to feel (or even be) a certain way.

With this, the dilemma arises - To be, or to not be depressed? 

While with SSRIs I am more physically free (my body doesn't get anxious as easily, or depressed which leaves me tired and not wanting to do anything, or worse...) and more productive with my life, I also feel like I'm suffocating myself emotionally, because, even though SSRIs do let me feel sad and sometimes even ""depressed"", I still feel like I'm not being the real me, and instead feeling and doing what is expected of me.

Thinking about this scares me a little. Even though, the answer should be obvious, I also think about what's going to happen later in life if I do keep taking these.

It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it’s better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i’m the same as them, as if we’re all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it’s because their so mad at the other person’s opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn’t that mean you’ve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I’m not an object.

It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it’s better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i’m the same as them, as if we’re all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it’s because their so mad at the other person’s opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn’t that mean you’ve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I’m not an object.

,depression,"Hi all. 

I have struggled with depression and anxiety from the age of 14, I’m 31 this month. 

I have worked since the age of 15 at various different jobs, I finally thought I’d found one now that was okay while I started to apply to study to go forward to apply for a probation officer program. 

My job is becoming stressful, a lot of pressure and I just can’t cope - I feel it’s impacting my mental health again, my anxiety is through the roof and I’m looking to apply for other jobs with less responsibility so I can do my job and head off home after not worrying sick. 

In the last 2/3 years there’s been jobs that have been terrible, I was bullied out of a job because I spoke up about the way things that weren’t right and it’s just destroyed any confidence I may have had. 

I can feel myself spiralling again into crisis like I was at the start of the year and I just don’t know what to do anymore, it’s starting to develop into intense suicidal thoughts with serious intention again. 

I try so hard, I try my best and work as hard as I can and it just feels like it’s never good enough and it always goes wrong. I’m just so tired of it all now, not just how many times I can keep going through this cycle.

Outwardly I try my best to be extroverted and confident to get away from the kid I used to be. But on the inside, Im just trying so so hard to pass as a normal person. Every night I think terrible things about myself and consider ending it. I know I won&amp;#39;t do it because I have responsibilities but the thoughts are always there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish I didn&amp;#39;t have to try so hard. I wish this wasn&amp;#39;t just my natural state of being. Idk if I should blame how my parents treated me or blame being an only child or blame my sexual/gender orientation or I don&amp;#39;t fucking know. but its really true that even in kindergarten I never fit in and was always sadder than the other kids. I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t feel sorry for myself and I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t think this is just how I am but. it is how I am.  I just. wish I could just exist and didn&amp;#39;t have to try so hard to not be unbearably sad all the time&lt;/p&gt;

Hello everyone I hope you're feeling better than I am right now


I've always known that I wouldn't have the same experiences as peers my age because I have older parents, they were 39(mom) and 58/9(dad) respectively when they had me 


I love my parents so much but I knew early on that I'll probably say goodbye sooner than my peers with their parents, whilst I pray to my Allah that I'll have more time with them, I can't help ny feelings about death 


My father died a couple years ago and even though I knew it was coming for years due to his age and illnesses it absolutely broke me, I was broken and probably am still broken from his death, I experienced grief later on because whilst I cried and mourned for weeks after his death it was around 2 months after where it really hit me that he died, I changed and was feeling suicidal for a long time but I couldn't do anything because I knew my mother was still here and I have to be strong for her 


Now I am still praying my mother lives for a long long time, I can't help but be scared and anxious for her leaving me, she has her own health problems and I am scared and petrified of what ifs, I can't lose another parent especially not my mother


I know I probably have Anticipatory Grief, I've had it since I was a child, it damaged my thinking now as an adult because I formed a fear of missing a call or getting called at night thinking it is bad news, back when I was a child whenever I get a phone call at night I was scared that it was because of my father passing, and he really did pass at night, I got call from his caretaker that he passed in the hospital, I was about to visit him in the morning and he passed, I couldn't even see him before he was buried due to circumstances


I am still scared that one day my mother will also leave me and I don't know if I can live on without her

,depression,"This is gonna be a long post and it’s probably not gonna be well written so bear with me. Reddit is the only non biased place I can vent and seek advice at the same time. 

I am an angry person. I hate everyone and everything. I have no idea why.

My childhood was good I guess. I feel like my parents did a good job raising me. I wasn’t spoiled but I did have more opportunities than my peers. I am an only child. So I can’t think of any childhood trauma that would cause my anger issues. The only thing that maybe would have anything to do with it is when I was in high school I was the kid everyone picked on but tbh it didn’t really bother me because I didn’t like anyone anyways lol

I didn’t start noticing how much of a hostile person I am until I reached adulthood. At 19 I bought my first home, had a good job, good friend group, etc. I did develop an alcohol problem but got it under control after my DUI when I was 24. I still drink occasionally but only when I’m home. There is no correlation between my anger and alcohol. Just wanted to add that for context on my life. I have the smallest fuse. If someone looks at me the wrong way I’m ready to kill them. I can’t count on my fingers and toes the amount of times I’ve plotted someone’s death in my head. 

I’m now 29 and it’s like the anger is full force. I’m happily engaged to the love of my life and he is literally the best person in the world. He’s very patient and understanding and non judge mental. What’s crazy is I’ve felt like I’ve gotten more angry in the last 3 years we’ve been together. But it has nothing to do with him or anything he’s done. He has a great career as do I so financials aren’t an issue. I used to be an extrovert now I can’t stand to leave the house. I can’t stand to be around people because people are fucking stupid. If someone says something stupid it will send me into a rage. If someone is loud/obnoxious I imagine hurting them. I love the thought of beating the shit out of someone who messes with me.

Here’s where it turns into depression. I will get so mad about something so minute and after I blackout from shear anger I beat myself up because once I calm down I’m embarrassed for myself at how mad I get. I do have a history of suicidal thoughts and 1 attempt (during my alcohol abuse). Generally when I do get angry it doesn’t turn physical. I don’t put my hands on people. It pretty much gets compartmentalized. 

My biggest problem is I don’t have any non religious connections that I can properly seek help from. 

I got extremely angry tonight. I had one of the most violent outbursts I’ve had in a while. It started with my DoorDash order. It was wrong. I got pissed. Then I was playing a video game. Game lagged out and I lost all my progress. Rage quit. Decided to go take a shower because I figured that would make me feel better. Went to wash my hair and I was out of conditioner. I then threw all the bottles out of the shower. My fiancé has a little mirror in the shower and I almost punched it when I saw my reflection. 

I’m to the point where I hate myself. I can’t lose weight because of my hormones I’m on from a hysterectomy in 2019. I’m not an obese person just slightly overweight. My sleep is being affected because of my anger turns depression. I’m too afraid to take sleeping meds because I already don’t hear my alarm clock in the mornings. I’m constantly stressed or mad about something. Those suicidal thoughts are coming back and it scares tf out of me. 

Now I’m mad I can’t fix me.

&lt;p&gt;I’m to the point where I hate myself. I can’t lose weight because of my hormones I’m on from a hysterectomy in 2019. I’m not an obese person just slightly overweight. My sleep is being affected because of my anger turns depression. I’m too afraid to take sleeping meds because I already don’t hear my alarm clock in the mornings. I’m constantly stressed or mad about something. Those suicidal thoughts are coming back and it scares tf out of me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I’m mad I can’t fix me. &lt;/p&gt;

At the time I thought it was really funny, but I told somebody else that joke today and they didn't laugh. I asked my friend if she had thought it was funny and she said she did now, but that it had hurt her feelings a little in the moment. Learning that made me feel terrible. 

The other day I told my boss he looked weird in his shirt. I meant to say seeing him in a certain casual shirt was weird cause I'm so used to seeing him dressed as a boss. I felt bad and had to track him down later to apologize and he said he had actually thought it was funny and that he felt bad that I felt the need to apologize. Which made me feel worse like I'd made a situation that wasn't awkward into one that was. 

But the big giant thing is I just ended things with someone I really, really care about and deeply love. This man is really just the best. We were friends first. He's kind, he's loyal, he's funny, he's so generous, and I wanted our relationship to work but I just wasn't feeling it for whatever reason. I ended things as quickly as I realized, and he is taking it really hard. He's a beautiful soul and I never would want to hurt him and now I doubt he'll ever want to be my friend again. 

I just feel like I keep hurting peoples feelings, or if I didn't, I think myself into circles until I convince myself that I did. Or sometimes I REALLY hurt people.

Hey everyone,

Now every time I call him, if I ask for money for anything (cuz I barely make a couple hundred dollars a month at my part time job in high school), he gets upset and acts like I’m asking him a huge favor.

I’m getting stressed the hell out on expenses to how I’m gonna pay for college.

,depression,"Hello. I'm 31 years old male from Puerto Rico, and still living with my mother. I wish this wasn't the case, but I don't have any money to buy my own house. I'm also obese at 5'8"" 280 pounds. At times I try to do exercise, but I find it extremely difficult and don't last long. Also, I tell myself that I'm going to start lifting weights, but I have zero motivation and have a hard time concentrating. I always feel like hot garbage, zero energy, sloppy. I've had some ancestors that had cancer, could it be a hereditary disease or something? I've lived a very sedentary life for 11 years.

I feel helpless, I can't sleep at night. I live in a house where they have a car repair shop. I'm willing to work there but constantly find myself distracted and don't do anything.

I wish I had a job that paid me the minimum wage at least, but I live in a somewhat rural area, lots of houses but not many commercial buildings. Everything is 30 minutes away and I don't have a car. I could use some money right now.

What can I do to improve my life? Are there any supplements out there that help with well-being? Maybe I have some type of deficiency that makes me feel like I'm depressed. Perhaps a chemical unbalance in the brain? When I try to sleep at night, I feel like someone is performing an exorcism on me and feel awful.

I know there are supplements out there that could help me, but I have no idea which. I ingest anti-depressants like Ativan, Restoril and Zyprexa. The only thing they do is aid with sleep somewhat.

There are lots of things I want, like a gaming computer and perhaps find a girlfriend, but women like men who are in shape and take care of themselves. I have a hard time brushing my teeth.

I'm convinced there's something wrong with me, but I don't know what it is. My school experience was terrible, I was bullied from middle school, then my parents got divorced right before I entered high school and moved 2 hours away. The last few years of school didn't get much better.

I want to live, be happy and feel good. I'd love to travel a little perhaps, although I'm not a huge fan of traveling, but most importantly, I want to achieve independence.

My dream is to play iRacing. I've always been big on video games, and always aspired to have iRacing since it was released, almost two decades ago. I find it hard to believe that I haven't yet played that game. I'm super scared to talk to people with fears that they're going to make fun of me.

What is wrong with me? I always tell myself, if others can do something, I can do it too.

When I was in high school, I fantasized about being a trans, started doing stupid things with my food, like overeating white rice so my glutes would get bigger. I also made my testicles drop so I could produce more estrogens to look like a woman. Could it be hormonal imbalance? My fapping doesn't feel good at all like it did in high school. I have man boobs as well and my orgasms are super weak. I think I have erectile dysfunction. I am uncircumcised. 

I almost had intercourse with a man in his 60's when I was in high school. Entered his house at least 10 times with intentions of doing it, but never actually did anything. Perhaps that scene gave me some mental trauma? He did touch me a few times, but I was scared and just left the house. I also gave my stepbrother head once when I was 15. Maybe I have a disease or something.

My father was pretty abusive when I was younger, I've always been told to respect older peers, he would sometimes hit me with belts when I did something bad in school. It was super scary; I was always scared of him.

I don't want to get in trouble, I just want to get to the bottom of my issue, assuming there is one. I just want to be happy. I really need to get in shape first if I want to find a woman willing to be with me.

I smoked weed in high school and had a panic attack. My memory of that situation is not very good. I'm not sure if I did something to trigger the panic attack. I may have started doing circles, which made me dizzy, but I'm not sure.

Any supplements or pills out there that could help my well-being? Multivitamins are not doing the trick.

I also experienced jock itch, which I thought was candida albicans. This jock itch thing lasted for more than a decade from 2011 to 2022. It has been gone for almost two years now, but I still may have something down there.

Spanish is my first language. I have family members in California that have decent income, but they don't want me there or even help me at all. My father lives there and I wish I could move with him but it's not his house.

I share all of these things with you to see if we can get to the bottom of my issues.

&lt;p&gt;Spanish is my first language. I have family members in California that have decent income, but they don&amp;#39;t want me there or even help me at all. My father lives there and I wish I could move with him but it&amp;#39;s not his house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I share all of these things with you to see if we can get to the bottom of my issues. Maybe it&amp;#39;s medical or something insignificant or easy to fix, I don&amp;#39;t know.&lt;/p&gt;

I mediate, write, gym, pray.

Yet living more open to feelings and what courses through me can sometimes undermine me.

I have friends but no one I’m really that close with or feel comfortable enough to talk to.

What hurts is that NONE of them will tell me the truth. Even when I ask.

maybe all normal siblings hate each other? also maybe it's an inferiority complex thing idk.

I am getting pressured by my father, who doesn&amp;#39;t let me enjoy things, and only makes me study for a &amp;quot;good future&amp;quot;. I keep getting bullied my older brother when I didn&amp;#39;t even do anything, he forces me to watch gore since I was 10. He locks the door, then forces me to watch these stuff and when I say I don&amp;#39;t want to I get beaten up. When I told this to my father he said &amp;quot;that&amp;#39;s discipline, grow up and learn how to be a man&amp;quot;.  I had lots of friends a few months ago and now all of them abandoned me.I was a happy boy who had good grades and friends and all of these things are gone and I am lonely. I don&amp;#39;t know what gone wrong, I never changed. I get blamed for everything that goes wrong even though I have nothing to do with it. I don&amp;#39;t want to have a boring life like this and enjoy my life rather than my father forcing me to do things I do not like. I am not saying making your son study is bad but you must let them enjoy their life and not force them to study 24/7 and yell at them when they use their phone or computer. I don&amp;#39;t have any hobbies left, I can&amp;#39;t do anything other than study. What can I do, please? &lt;/p&gt;

,depression," Crazy-? 

 I’ve been an outcast my entire life. In my family, with friends, school, anywhere I go it feels like I’m pinned against a wall. They look at me as if I’m not human- my mom said she could tell someone I’m special needs and they wouldn’t question it, she has to understand that’s hurtful right?

Growing up I was outgoing and loud, in my family I was categorized with my cousin, we were “the weird kids”, my cousins would make fun of him when he wasn’t around and I know they did the same with me. They have called me childish for as long as I can remember, but obviously I was childish I was a fucking child. As I grew up I got quieter, anxious and terrified of disappointing people. I had some not so great relationships and friendships that made me feel crazy. I was 12 when these things started happening, dated someone that was not good for me to say the least. Started hurting myself in 7th grade because of them, broke up after almost  5 months and I spent the next 2 years yearning for their attention, for them to love me the way I loved them. They used me to take out all there anger, they were so nice when we met, an amazing friend but as soon as we dated they became hurtful and cold. Treated everyone around me kindly and me like total shit. A couple months after we broke up I got close to him, a person I can’t bare to see. He laughs and makes gag noises when he sees me as if I was the problem- he lied to me through our entire relationship, made up people and story’s. Told me that he had certain things in his closet, hurtful things- said his dad hit him and even made up 3 fake friends to trick me into things. I knew he was lying I’m not an idiot but I “loved” him. We were on and off for months and I honestly can’t remember all the horrible things he made me do because they are so far repressed into my mind. I remember one night in particular tho, I wish I could forget it- I was at his house and we were hanging out having a good time, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and told me he wanted to “try something” he gave me the knife and took off his shorts and told me to cut him. he said that he was into it and when I said I didn’t want to he said I didn’t love him. He claimed I had been lying to him and if i loved him id do it, so I took the knife and did what he said-  to make it even worse this little girl from across the street was there, he had her sit in the closet before it happened. she was 9, a fucking 9 year old. he's the one that made my self harm even worse, he made me start vaping, drinking, made me do things- he used to claim that he couldn't kiss me because of his braces which obviously I knew was a lie but I was to scared to ask him why he really wouldn't kiss me- ofc now i know its because he never actually loved me. one of the last nights i was at his house was the worst tho, he had made me do so many things before that night and i knew what was next. I had never had sex with anyone before, people talk about how there first time was special or amazing but mine was horrible- so horrible i barley remember it, he didn't want to touch me he only wanted me to touch him as he had the entire relationship. I didn't want to but I did because I thought he'd fall in love with me somehow. after that night we broke up completely and haven't talked since. No one knows about the things that happened with him, no one cares- we only broke up because the first abusive partner texted me, they said they loved me and wanted to be with me so I ended it with him. A week or two later they decided they hated me again, them along with my other “friend” texted me they hated me that new years along with a lot of other messages about how horrible I was, and both blocked me. A month later the other friend reached out and we began talking again, then my ex also reach out and everything was “fine” I started dating this person during that time, they were sweet but also not and our relationship didn’t last long because that February my ex texted me again. They came over and we had a night that we called “long hug night” we sat in my room and hugged for hours not saying anything, we were high and crying and we felt close. They said they wanted to kiss me but since I was dating someone I told them it couldn’t happen. A week later on April fools night I broke up with my boyfriend to be with them and a week after that they got cold again- we stopped talking after I yelled at them for doing that again and a month later I found out they were dating my friend. During all of this the ex-friend that joined my ex in hating on me for new years had gotten rather close to me, I found out they liked me and one Wednesday at a friends house we kissed. The next week he came over and we had a great time, at one point we kissed again and made out which from my knowledge was completely ok because he didn’t tell me he didn’t want to and we had kissed the week before. 3 days later I found out he told a bunch of our friends that I sexually assaulted him. Everyone was against me and I lost almost all of my friends over a lie- I have been SA and I would never do that to someone else. Back to the girl and my ex though, I only found out they were together because they broke up and after they did I felt bad for my friend and asked if she wanted to see a movie with me to cheer her up, we got close and started dating and I bet you know we’re this leads. She claimed to be a “lesbian” but since I am trans and identify as a male she wasn’t one, she got mad at me for mentioning top surgery and continued to say she was lesbian while dating a trans man. After a bit I lost connection because of this and I broke up with her and 2 months later on October 1st to 6th my sister got in a car accident and died. She was 16, and I was 14. I couldn’t believe it- ofc during this that ex-friend that cost me nearly all of my friends showed up again, he apologized for the things he said and told people and wanted to be friends again. Since we had mutual friends we got closer and I thought it was behind us until he got cold months later and screamed at me. During the October my sister died I got close to this girl, scarlet, she was kind and sweet and she dressed up as Garfield for Halloween. That December we kissed while watching tinkerbell and started dating January 15th 2023. I have nothing bad to say about her because it’s currently july 14th 2024 and our year and a half is tomorrow. I love her more than worlds can describe. 

But even with the girl I want to marry someday I still feel crazy. I hate myself more than I thought possible and everyday is weighing on me. Although to everyone else around me it looks like nothings happening I’m crumbling. Struggling to wake up each morning and not scream at myself. I have diagnosed ADHD and anxiety along with so many other issues that are tearing me apart. My girlfriend thinks I have an eating disorder, people I’ve talk to think I have autism or am bipolar, and everyone else thinks I’m crazy. I’m 16 man- I’m just a kid. All I can think about is how badly I hate everything I do. I have no dreams, no future plans, no hope. I’m terrified of driving, I don’t have a job, I have nothing. It feels like everyone hates me, and if they don’t now they will. I can’t stop hurting myself or getting high or eating to much or starving myself. I know change starts with me and no one else can fix this but I don’t know how to. I’m a fat, ugly, tranny that my parents don’t even want. They want their little girl but she died a long time ago and if they’re not careful they’ll lose their boy too. I’m this close to ending it all, I can’t keep living like this. I’m tired of carrying this burden, I’m tired of being such a burden to people that I love. I can’t stop being terrible, it feels like that’s all I’ve ever been. Like I deserve everything that’s happened to me- I’m suicidal, homicidal, and I need real help that I can’t get. I wish for something horrible to happen to me because just maybe they’ll care and realize I wasn’t fucking playing around. I’m serious and I’ve always been serious- maybe I am crazy  ",t2_o3y7vclr4,False,,0,False,Crazy? ,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e3lq5e,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1721016864.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crazy-? &lt;/p&gt;

I upset my mom for being “grown” and choosing to live my own life. My best friend’s family despises me because I encourage her to be herself and call them out on the toxic environment they put her through.

I am a 31 year old female. All of my life I have suffered from severe inattentive ADHD and depression.  Victim of a narcissistic toxic family, labeled the black sheep. FF to my adult life. Survivor of domestic violence, then later unrelated a violent rape. 2 years ago now almost 3 I lost custody of my son. He is 9 now.  I see him every Wednesday, Friday, and every other Saturday. The coparent is a narcissist who is extremely controlling and if it is not their way its no ones way. Always in the public eye, the one with the most money, never follows the order, constantly filling my child's head with manipulative bullshit. When its good its great but it always fleeting always temporary.     Over the past 9 years so many times I  have thought about finality.    I won't elaborate on that I think most of you can understand it.   

  
I want to change. I am so tired of living life this way. I am constantly physical exhausted, agitated, or just ready to give up.  The only time I feel any shred of happiness is when I am with my son or get to hear his voice on the phone. He is the only thing that keeps me going.   I am a first responder.  I am in RN school.   I start in August.   I want to get on a medication to help with my ADHD so that I can focus but also a medication that will help with my depression giving me energy, purpose and drive to get up and DO things throughout the day.

I want to know what works for you.   I am going to list the medications that I have tried here and the side effects that I have had: 

Strattera-Currently on it. Not giving up just yet. Seriously bad anxiety. 40mg

Lexapro: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Trileptal: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Prozac: Giddy, would laugh inappropriately which happens to me a lot on antidepressants. 

Zoloft: Giddy, would laugh inappropriately. (This is for the first 2 weeks of most antidepressants with me. Its embarrassing and I work in direct patient care. I cannot be like this at work period.

Effexor XR: Very bad depression and a serious almost police involved attempt.

Trintellix: Bitchy and agitated

Cymbalta or Duloxetine: Serious anxiety for the first month of taking to the point where I had to get off.

Citalopram: Have been on it. Don't really remember it but I think anxiety.

Bupropion or Wellbutrin XR:  Bitchy and lightheaded. Did not really give it the best trial run. 

Lamictal: So aggressive and agitated that a trip to the ER and handcuffed to a chair

Geodon: Made me fall asleep in my food

Latuda: Craved sweets constantly 

Abilify: Made me slur my speech, crave sweets, felt sedated

Depakote: Made me slur my speech, rock back and forth, agitated

Caplyta: Crave sweets, weird dreams, crying spells

Clonazepam(Klonopin) Currently take PRN

Ativan: Serious memory issues.

Xanax: Depression.

Buspirone: Very bad headache did not manage anxiety effectively

Vistaril: Laughable did absolutely noting for my anxiety. Made my nose extremely dry.

,depression,"I somehow became interested if there were levels of free-floating sadness/gloom even more severe than depression/dysthymia, and came upon melancholia. While it doesn’t look like I match enough symptoms, I did note with interest on one page that it’s very frequently comorbid with musculoskeletal aches/pains.

I immediately thought of my own teleporting minor aches (i.e. on the 1-10 pain scale, they’re generally 1, or even 0.5).

,depression,"Let's start saying i (M15) don't want to kill myself, neither self harm (unless you count aggressively biting my nails :P).
I feel like i move by pure inertia. I waited a lot of time dreaming of having friends and hanging out with them, but now that i have really good friends, i feel too tired to hang out with them most of the times.
My life is pretty simple. I wake up, i go to school (not for now lol), i come home, i play videogames, i have dinner, i play videogames, i go to sleep. Every day. I've tried lots of sports and hobbies, but still i didn't find a passion, and I'm starting to lose hope in finding it.
And the fact is... That i both like and hate my life. I know i'm wasting my life saying at home doing nothing, but i never have the energies to get out of this trashy routine. if i start something, it's because it happens, in a way or another. 

I just broke up with my gf because she was basically flirting with her friends and she gave me very little attention compared to how much i cared about her, and now i'm sure i can't be loved anymore. No one will ever love me as i do. And everytime someone comforts me saying ""you'll find someone"", i thank them but deep down i know it's a lie said to make me happy.
If i rationally listed all the reasons to not kms (i repeat: i have 0 intention of doing so), i'd probably find out that they are way less than before.
I see being depressed as a goal now.

,depression,"Hi, I’m a 23(F) University student who has been struggling with diagnosed anxiety and depression for 9 years (7 years diagnosed). 
I get extremely anxious whenever I think about studying, am studying or when I know that I have to go back to uni soon. I haven’t been able to sleep well, so I often wake up depressed. It’s not that I have trouble falling asleep but I get depressing dreams or nightmares.

I’ve been crying almost everyday and been trying to get my mind off things, but I still struggle a lot. Tbh, I have thought about seeing a psychologist again but just the thought of making appointments and finding time to actually talk already gives me anxiety.

I have no motivation for anything.. I constantly feel stressed and have negative suicidal thoughts however, Ik that I will never actually do it due to fear of pain. I want to leave this place so bad but I’m terrified of doing it. 

I used to have a career goal but university has been me change my mind twice, so now I feel stuck..

I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they’re the only thing keeping me going. And while they’re away my dog is going to the kennels because I can’t even look after her by myself.

Every day I feel more useless and helpless, I don't know what to do anymore :(
Some context: me and my best friend have been friends for about 5 years, she's had depression for as long as I can remember. We are both minors and we go to different schools, so we don't see each other very often and most of the time we only talk via chat. She has self-harmed several times before and, even if she thankfully hasn't attempted ending her life, she has thought about it. Ever since she started telling me about her depression and her problems, I did everything I could to help her. Unfortunately, because I didn't know how to react to that kind of situation, I think I ended up doing more harm than good. I would sometimes lash out at her, minimizing her feelings and overall saying very hurtful things that I didn't really mean. I know it was wrong and I feel terribly guilty about it. Apparently, because of this, she has become more reserved with me and no longer tells me her problems.

I'm trying to become a better person for her so I try to ask her if she's okay (when I can, since we don't talk much right now). She just told me that she was a little sad. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said no, but hinted that she tried to hurt herself yesterday (she had done it before, I managed to stop her for a while but to no avail as she did it again). I honestly didn't know what to say. It stresses me out a lot that she doesn't tell me what's happening to her since I don't know how can I help her, but at the same time I know that I can't force her to tell me, especially after how I was to her. I really don't want her to hurt herself and I feel very sad to hear it, especially since she promised me she wouldn't do it again but she ended up doing it anyway. But I know I don't have to take it personally since this doesn't have anything to do with me. It just  distresses me so much to know that she's going through so much suffering, to the point of wanting to hurt herself, and I can't do anything at all.

So, in summary: how do I get her to open up to me again? How can I be a good friend to her? And, in the best case scenario, how can I make sure she doesn't have thoughts like that anymore and hopefully feels better?

Some context: me and my best friend have been friends for about 5 years, she&amp;#39;s had depression for as long as I can remember. We are both minors and we go to different schools, so we don&amp;#39;t see each other very often and most of the time we only talk via chat. She has self-harmed several times before and, even if she thankfully hasn&amp;#39;t attempted ending her life, she has thought about it.

,depression,"I've really been trying fix my life

I've made so many mistakes and at times I feel like I'm not good at anything.

I wasn't good in school

I tried going into the military. To get college money, try to get motivated into being a better person, get into better shape, and have time to figure out what I wanna do in life.

Reality wise, I wasn't good at it, was even more depressed and fell into a cycle of barely passing my fitness while also getting more demotivated and still had no idea what I wanted out of life.

So after 4 years I knew I wasn't a good fit for this role and would have eventually been kicked out so I wanted get out, get a regular paying security guard gig as a temporary thing to do something easy while I figure things out.

fast forward 6 years later, mediocre pay with a crappy job and I'm not any closer to figuring out my life than I was at 18 when it was time to get a job and try to make something of my life.

So I asked my dad for some advice. He gave me a couple ideas, one leading into HVAC technician.

Seemed like something I could get into.

I used my GI bill, went to school, got training and everything seemed great. Then I tried applying to jobs but no one would hire me

Got a job at Circle K maintenance, cause they made it seem like they needed people with experience in plumbing, electrician, and HVAC. But reality wise I'm not doing anything HVAC related (they keep telling me they wanna do that eventually but I don't know if eventually is 5 months or 5 years)

So after 6 months of being a glorified janitor, I try applying for other jobs again

Got an interview for an actual HVAC company only to find out how little I actually know of the field and how much competition there actually is.

Its gotten to the point where any choice I make I feel like I'll never make something of myself, I feel like no matter what I do I keep fucking up and keep failing

I feel like no matter how many times I try to climb out of this hole, the hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper and I just keeping slipping to the bottom.

,depression,"I haven't really told or opened up like this to anyone but after seeing people open up on here and the support, I thought I could try as well. 

I'm \[19F\] currently starting my second sem of uni and honestly...its not going how I planned at all. I failed three courses, am eating horribly and generally not feeling like myself anymore to the point where I don't even want to eat, drink or do anything cuz it makes me sick to my stomach at the fact that I...am alive? idk how to describe it. My moods constantly change so fast it's like getting whiplash, I can't face my peers without being revolted in myself and honestly...im so tired of feeling like this. My family are disappointed in my behaviour and my friends try to help but it's just them being like 'don't take it too seriously' or 'oh no, you're fine'. I can't listen to music or find any entertainment anymore cuz this stress is just eating at my brain like a damn parasite and I absolutely hate it.

I tried searching up these things online everything says I might have depression or anxiety but I guess in my mind I don't want to accept that cuz if I do the reality of it all sinks in. In my culture it's kinda taboo talking about mental health and stuff so my family tries to help but it's mostly just 'people have it worse than you', 'stop being dramatic', and the classic 'it's your phone that's the problem'. Part of me knows they are right but it doesn't really help. Im still 19 and can't secure a job, not very open and social and now I have to worry about some immigration issues or else my whole family could risk getting deported. 

Basically, my dad has been trying to secure a stable resident status abroad for almost a decade now and failed. And since we are considered immigrants here, we've been living as international people the whole time- despite living here for 10 years by 2025. It's honestly drained our whole family to the point where we haven't even gone out to a restaurant to eat or enjoyed life for so long. My parents fight constantly and I have to put everything aside to mediate them and be the therapist for everyone since I was 10. But now that I'm considered an adult and have finished primary and high school here, I have a chance at changing it all and gaining residency for my family. 

Naturally, I'm ecstatic that I can finally do something about this situation but with everything else, I'm so scared that I'll screw this up too. My dad says I should take a gap year and secure this, since the process might take about three years but I'm already enrolled and have started 2nd year of uni. I've been trying to find the course I need to do while juggling uni but the intakes available are only in Jan 2025 and it makes me even more hopeless cuz by then I'll already be 20, while my friends are all way ahead of me and thriving. I honestly just feel stuck in my life and even after I tried to stay positive and not take things too seriously, it still weighs me down so much mentally and emotionally.

,depression,"I dont think I remember the last time someone genuinely returned the efforts or even seemed to enjoy having me in their lives. every relatives too busy doing their own thing so like we only meet up once every blue moon unless its the usual but even they tend to seem less interested in me as a person. I have had so many failed ""friendships"" that I just end up not caring for people anymore. In fact I would not care if society or this earth didnt exist, its a hellhole trying to find somewhere to belong and trying to do well at something.

I also cant count the amount fo general bullshit I have had to deal with over this life. yet people seem forgetful or clueless when it clmes to their own behaviour often telling me its just a joke or outright invalidating everything I say or feel thus making me withdraw from others. I try to care about the latest thinfs but I dont feel overly attached to nothing, people mostly seem to have a statement to say to me then thats all there is to the conversation, nothing more nothing less just nothing for me to go on because theyre not putting their share of effort into it.

For example I have one ""friend"" whos clearly the type that has 100s of other friends online but she has such little effort with me that I often wonder why I bother with her in the first place. She only seems to message me when say theres an online quiz or some other shit otherwise again she doesnt seem to notice that I go months without hearing from nobody. Sometimes I question if I am even real because I cant find no place to fit in no matter what I try theres people who try to get me into unfair situations or unhelpful situations theres been endless counts fo gossiping but no one else but myself has noticed it so no one else has even tried to prevent it, people just make snarky comments judgemental looks at me even for merely trying to exist in a social setting. For example I was in an outdoor store and there were two old hags in there at the same time as myself and my mum, and they were outright sideeying me and whispering just loud enough for me to hear it and they inly stopped when I stared back.

I feel like its got worse with social media because I try not to feel so bored, lonely and done with this whole ""life"" thing but when I aint got no one else to hang out with cause people have turned me down in the past even if I made the suggestions yet they would happily do things with other people and post about it online. it basically rubs in my face that they really never did care or simply they do not need me in their life. Or that their life is some how more interesting than mine. Thus leading to me feeling fomo for not being able to get anywhere and society always says its never too late but it does get to a point where everyone else my age has something going for them and people judge anyone my age for not being at the same point as everyone else.

In lockdown I tried reaching out to former classmates but only got one response and I expected him to reply but havent heard nothing since and it feels weird to message someone who got their life and he got his own family together yaknow? what do I do? theres literally nowhere else I can find my ""people"" and it sucks when O have to witness younger people being able to do more or have their own group and then they can share it online for anyone else to oggle at.

I dont mean nothing special to nobody. its fact at this point. if you arent rich no one cares, if you arent popular no one cares, if u quiet no one going to give u enough chance to socialise because everyone so mf loud and attention seeking, if you arent rich then also no one cares for you.

People just dont want long meaningful connections outside of the people they have around them, I might as well be a mf ghost as well cause people fucking act like im not part of anyones lives as it is.

The friend that message me about the quiz didnt even ask nothing not a hello, how are you? not a what are your latest interests? I thought it was bad in school but with social media and smartphones it feels sp alienating? everyone else so busy with their lives and showcasing it online they aint caring about those they leave behind. Even people that are on rhe street get more attention than myself they wouldnt dare ask me what I been doing and I cant think of nothing to say because in social situations those loud enough get most the attention and hog all the conversations so even if someone ask me I get maybe 5 seconds and one sentence out of it.

You have to actually force yourself to find something worthwhile to care about be it sports or some other stupid celebrities or movie series because it seems thats the only way people would ever have anything in common enough tonwant to converse with you. otherwise they dont care how you feel, they dont care what you doing if it not anything relevant to themselves. I dont want gifts I want deep meaningful connections that last in the long run where we check up on one another but even with social fucking media people dont put that saame effort badk make me wonder why I shouldnt just put myself 6 feet under

Eeven the arupid retarded part time job I couldnt make that last and if I did anything to try to socialise people either didnt care for what I say, the younger folk already had their own group and the manager would pretend to be nice but then snitch about me to her mamager and thus it seemed like I cant get nothing out of it anymore.

Now I don't know what to do I can't get over her and the only this comes to my mind is her.

I am trying to switch jobs but for every company I apply I don't even hear back from them.


I have also going through some financial crunch too. My salary just vanishes, even if I try to be more careful with my money, something will come up and i will runout of the money by end of the month.


2-3 years ago I came to know that my father had an affair with someone close to my family. My father and mother are married for like 35 years. The relationship my parents have is like a relationship of compromise.

I check phone of my father every now and then and I notice my father even texts to that women even now.


Due to this I don't want to get married,just for the sake of getting married...

moving on to my sister: shes somewhat social. she hit puberty over half a year ago. she completely changed her looks. she started wearing black, baggy clothes and spends one hour doing full face make up, which our family wasnt so happy of, including me, since it was so sudden and she doesnt even need it. but honestly i dont care about these things. anyway, she has a couple of friends but ive heard she has gotten into a fight with one of them which she has mentioned a couple of times to me and my family but we kinda brushed it off since she didnt really wanna talk about it either. then she has gotten a boyfriend, whom she broke up with 2 weeks later into the relationship because he cheated. and honestly she didnt seem affected by it, i think its clear why. 

main thing she does is keep her room really messy. like insanely messy. about 5 hrs age there was leftover food on the floor, flies everywhere, sticky desk, make up stains everywhere and so on.... my dad were obvously not happy. he came and had a meltdown about her room. yesterday and today to the point where he took her phone. i could tell my sister was upset cuz she didnt go out at all, only to the bathroom for like 5mins. and this happens quite often. i can relate to this aswell, i could even say its normal in our family to get yelled at this much for our rooms but its really apparent she doesnt take it well. on top of that my parents tell everyone INCLUDING ME that she has an ""additue"" and she needs to fix it. but its just her being upset for my dad contantly yelling at her. theres many other things id mention but it would be too much. and on top of that, one of her friends moms told our mom that my sister and her friend were talking about how shes self harming, how she feels worthless ect. and its just so weird to me, why are u spying on my sister? and after that incident she has been wwearing a hoodie for the past 2 weeks. keep in mind its really hot where we live. and its just overall unusual.

  
anyway, i dont use tiktok, snd she does every day. so i had the random thought to check out her account, and it was full of depressed stuff. she was talking about how in her mind, shes fat,and she should stop eating less, or how she was hurting herself and had suicidal thoughts just because our parents got mad because she didnt clean her room. and thats when i got the idea of telling this to someone, because i seriously dont know how to approach this. maybe i should tell my mom, since shes more understanding than my dad. but talking to my sister wouldnt be a great idea since like i said, im still healing from my own things. i dont know how to confort people let alone my sister that im not that close with to this extend.

,depression,"I thought I was stable. I wasn't. 

I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

,depression,"For the first time in my life, I am overweight and extremely depressed. I’m in treatment. I go about twice a week, but I don’t have my own car. I’m 31. I’m single I don’t have any friends. I was born with chronic allergies. I have 30+ I have EOE I have asthma. I have digestive issues. I live in a small town. I can barely go anywhere. I can’t work and my treatment is dragging their feet on helping me get disability. There are some days where I can’t even get myself out of bed and I just piss in a bottle. and I’m not even overweight. I’m just around 200 pounds.  And it’s different for me because most of my life I weighed 160.. I’m stuck in a house with smokers and it doesn’t help my asthma, but it’s literally the only place I could go without being on the street. Hopeless, I feel like I’ll never be good enough for anybody even though I try and remind myself that those are mine traps and I need to try and be positive. I just can’t do it. I say I can’t do it. I don’t like a cop out there times I’ve sat for hours at a time trying to think myself out of my depression. There’s been so many times I’ve told myself OK this is what the situation is. I just need to accept that and find something good about it and no matter how many times I try and do that I end up back at square one. Feel like I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know. I don’t really have any family. I mean, I have my mom and she’s helping take care of me but we have for the most part of pretty terrible relationship. My brother doesn’t speak to me and none of my extended family is in communication with me and I think it’s partially because, I was never really around them that much so it just normally happened that I went through my life without being around them. I mix and I live in a town that pretty racist. Not to mention everybody in this house things the lgbt is an agenda and gossips behind each others backs. I wanna get away from it all but idk how, and I’m burnt out on hope there’s no more hope left in me.. I’m just kinda here, I’m not suicidal I’m just stuck.. I feel powerless, I feel like life controls me and I have no control. I hate that I want control, I hate that I can’t be content but this isn’t some way to live. My only hope is low income housing and to find a low hours job while I wait for help with my SSI. I can’t do things on my own and nobody is helping me fast enough to get to a safe place..

I’m in treatment. I go about twice a week, but I don’t have my own car. I’m 31. I’m single I don’t have any friends. I was born with chronic allergies. I have 30+ I have EOE I have asthma. I have digestive issues. I live in a small town. I can barely go anywhere. I can’t work and my treatment is dragging their feet on helping me get disability. There are some days where I can’t even get myself out of bed and I just piss in a bottle. and I’m not even overweight. I’m just around 200 pounds.  And it’s different for me because most of my life I weighed 160.. I’m stuck in a house with smokers and it doesn’t help my asthma, but it’s literally the only place I could go without being on the street. Hopeless, I feel like I’ll never be good enough for anybody even though I try and remind myself that those are mine traps and I need to try and be positive. I just can’t do it. I say I can’t do it. I don’t like a cop out there times I’ve sat for hours at a time trying to think myself out of my depression. There’s been so many times I’ve told myself OK this is what the situation is. I just need to accept that and find something good about it and no matter how many times I try and do that I end up back at square one. Feel like I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know. I don’t really have any family. I mean, I have my mom and she’s helping take care of me but we have for the most part of pretty terrible relationship. My brother doesn’t speak to me and none of my extended family is in communication with me and I think it’s partially because, I was never really around them that much so it just normally happened that I went through my life without being around them. I mix and I live in a town that pretty racist. Not to mention everybody in this house things the lgbt is an agenda and gossips behind each others backs. I wanna get away from it all but idk how, and I’m burnt out on hope there’s no more hope left in me.. I’m just kinda here, I’m not suicidal I’m just stuck.. I feel powerless, I feel like life controls me and I have no control. I hate that I want control, I hate that I can’t be content but this isn’t some way to live. My only hope is low income housing and to find a low hours job while I wait for help with my SSI. I can’t do things on my own and nobody is helping me fast enough to get to a safe place.. I’m doing everything on my end to show up and reach out. But … the thing about suicide and why I’m reluctant is because the fact of me killing myself knowing nobody will be held accountable is , well, it’s fucked.

A lot of what I see on here i more normal I worry that what I’m about to say isn’t or that I will be judged. Please I just want help.

I have homicidal thoughts. I hate it. I hate most that I could do it and possibly get away with it. On a metric scale I’m attractive. So I know I could get them to follow me and do as I say till they realize what’sabout to happen. For background I was abused severely when put into the care of my aunt for a few years. I was sexually abused and was having hard drugs tested on me regularly by her boyfriend. After going back to my parents life was better until my dad passed. Watching him die in the street was the hardest thing I’ve had to endure. My homicidal thoughts began as nightmares I would see people bleeding out but never be able to make out any distinct features. It quickly escalated as I began hunting animals like deer. It went to intrusive thoughts about harming strangers, most of them had nothing in common except the fact that they where men. After meeting my friend we’ll call her Lilly it stopped momentarily. Until she committed. After that it was stronger than before. It became an itch burried in my skin I couldn’t reach, id try to scratch it till the skin was falling off it quickly became something that caused se me to almost twitch even in public. And the thoughts became more gruesome, I’d think of setting them loose in the woods and hunting them. I made a list of all the sex offenders in my city and watch them when I can. Staring at them and stalking. Hunting. There where moments if I staved myself enough that I didn’t feel the urge as much do to pure exhaustion. I’m introverted but do well socially so when I reconnected with my highschool friend who well call j it stopped for a moment just like with Lilly. I’m some ways he reminds me of her in his own way. The feeling of safety and comfort. After a while we confessed we had feeling for each other but due to his religion we didn’t and haven’t so much as kissed. And in someways I think that’s something I love about our situation. That it’s pure. Recently my thoughts have been coming back resulting in SH to try to stop them. I love him just like I did Lilly. I want these thoughts to stop. I want to have a normal life. Another factor that makes this so hard it that most days I can’t tell if I’m even alive. It feels like it not real. Like nothing is.

To add fire to the fuel, I don&amp;#39;t have any good talents, I don&amp;#39;t sing, or dance, and the best I could do is get an above-average grade in the class. It bothers me how I can be &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; but can&amp;#39;t be the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; in academics. The only passion I have is reading, I love to read. But of course, all good things come to an end, and I have been little by little reaching a slump. I don&amp;#39;t know what to feel. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like I am a body without a soul. Maybe I have been programmed this way my whole life, I cannot think of a single trauma that can cause this. I don&amp;#39;t know what I did in my past life to end up in this state. I truly believe I am better off dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to pity me and I don&amp;#39;t expect anyone to. I just wanted to get this off my chest and share my experience. To those who are experiencing the same thing, know you are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi everyone,

I am a 16-year-old female, and I’ve noticed some significant issues with myself. Unfortunately, I can't get a proper diagnosis because my parents are against it. Here are the problems I've been facing:

1. Academic Performance: I used to excel in academics until the 10th grade, scoring 95% in my exams. However, this was below my expectations, leading to burnout. Since then, I've subconsciously put in less effort, resulting in a significant drop in my grades in the 11th grade. Even when I try, it doesn't seem to be enough. I now experience extreme exam anxiety, which causes me to freeze and lose focus during exams, despite knowing the material.

2. Action Paralysis: I often find myself unable to start tasks, even when I want to and know I need to. Deadlines pass, and I’m unable to take action, which has severely impacted my productivity.

3. Attention Issues: My ability to pay attention has deteriorated significantly. I struggle to focus on anything for long periods, and this has been an issue for a while but has worsened recently.

4. Emotional Numbness: For the past year, I’ve felt emotionally numb and detached from everything in life. I don’t feel happiness, sadness, or any strong emotions, positive or negative. I also struggle to care about anything, which makes me feel worse, but I don’t even care about feeling worse.

5. Anxiety and Disorganization: My anxiety attacks have intensified. I frequently lose items, am very messy, and often disconnect from conversations, going blank for a while. I’ve lost interest in activities I once enjoyed, like working out. My daily routine, which used to drive me, now lacks structure and consistency.

6. Chronic Fatigue: I am always tired, regardless of how much rest I get.

Despite multiple attempts to improve my situation and get my grades back up, I keep failing to stick to my commitments and feel all over the place.

Can anyone offer advice or help on how to manage these issues?

,depression,"I don’t even know where to start.
I am in my late 20s and for the longest time, I have not been able to do much with my life or accomplish anything. 
A little background, I was good until highschool, I did more or less well academically and was pretty academically inclined, was considered smart and everything. The problem started when I finished highschool, I took a few years off(because of some issues) so I started college late, it already took a toll on my confidence and I felt too old and too late for everything. 

Eventually I finished college and I haven’t been able to accomplish anything else eversince. 
I blamed it all on my laziness, I rationalised myself blaming my failures on my laziness and lack of trying. 
But since last year, I really made a conscious effort to try. I really did try so hard mentally to focus on the task at hand, made small goals to accomplish, made a routine for myself. But I noticed that I could never focus on anything for more than 20 mins at most. Even though I would make a mental note to not let anything distract myself, I would find myself hours later being distracted by the smallest of things and would feel like shit for having wasted all those time and it would repeat all over again. 
I tried to lock my phone up somewhere far away from my room thinking it was the source of my distraction but my mind would still find something else to waste my time on. It became a mental torture at this point. 
It seems like I would rather do literally anything else than the task at hand it doesn’t even have to be enjoyable at that point. 
It’s like my mind has another mind of its own and i lose control of it. 
This has caused me some major distress. 

Another thing i’ve noticed that, nothing feels natural and comfortable to me. 
For example, even when i’m doing a simple task of doing laundry, holding my clothes or the jar of detergent feels uncomfortable and unnatural to me, like i’m not holding it properly or something. Everything I do feels wrong and uncomfortable.

I am in my late 20s and for the longest time, I have not been able to do much with my life or accomplish anything. 
A little background, I was good until highschool, I did more or less well academically and was pretty academically inclined, was considered smart and everything. The problem started when I finished highschool, I took a few years off(because of some issues) so I started college late, it already took a toll on my confidence and I felt too old and too late for everything. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually I finished college and I haven’t been able to accomplish anything else eversince. 
I blamed it all on my laziness, I rationalised myself blaming my failures on my laziness and lack of trying. 
But since last year, I really made a conscious effort to try. I really did try so hard mentally to focus on the task at hand, made small goals to accomplish, made a routine for myself. But I noticed that I could never focus on anything for more than 20 mins at most. Even though I would make a mental note to not let anything distract myself, I would find myself hours later being distracted by the smallest of things and would feel like shit for having wasted all those time and it would repeat all over again. 
I tried to lock my phone up somewhere far away from my room thinking it was the source of my distraction but my mind would still find something else to waste my time on. It became a mental torture at this point. 
It seems like I would rather do literally anything else than the task at hand it doesn’t even have to be enjoyable at that point. 
It’s like my mind has another mind of its own and i lose control of it. 
This has caused me some major distress. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing i’ve noticed that, nothing feels natural and comfortable to me. 
For example, even when i’m doing a simple task of doing laundry, holding my clothes or the jar of detergent feels uncomfortable and unnatural to me, like i’m not holding it properly or something. Everything I do feels wrong and uncomfortable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just really need some perspective on this because i can’t access therapy at this point. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to whoever read it till here. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi all,
this is gonna be a long post so many thanks in advance for your precious help.
I’m struggling to cope with my boyfriend’s depression as I don’t really know what’s going on in his head, therefore I don’t know what’s the best thing to do to help him and us as a couple.
So - to give you a bit of background: we’ve been together since last November; when we met and started dating we realised we weren’t just physically attracted to each other - we had lots of things in common and saw life the same way. When ok, he really is an amazing partner, very caring and supportive. I felt (and still feel) very lucky to have him. He disclosed his depression struggles to me from the beginning; he suffered from it all his life (he’s 28 now) and that is due to his bad upbringing/bad life experiences, + a feeling of being powerless to change things which are wrong in society.
When I got to know him better, I started to see his depression episodes unfolding and I also learned to see when they start as he becomes very apathetic and tells me he feels “cold and empty”. I’ve been observing the pattern and the length of these episodes varies: they may go from a few days to more serious ones which last a few weeks. During these episodes he bottles up, doesn’t go to work and neglects himself - he just lays in bed with no strength for anything; needless to say, during these times he disappears from me too and sometimes without warning (we don’t live together). When he’s ok and back to normal, he always tells me not to worry as he adores me so I should never take his illness personally - he just needs a break from everything as he can’t deal with anything. He doesn’t want to take medications and never did; I fully support this decision as I 100% agree. He simply wants to find the core reason of the problem and deal with it himself. He recently started to see a psychologist once or twice a week, but I can’t really see any improvement: some days he feels very happy and hopeful but some others (the majority of them) he’s back to his struggles. Now I know that depression is a serious disease and it may take him years to get over it, but my questions are: will he ever be able to fully recover from it, or he will have to embrace the illness all his life? Is it possible for me to get used to it and for us to have a fulfilling relationship despite this?
I’m asking you because he doesn’t want to talk too much about it with me.
Also, I tend to worry a lot when he disappears without warning, as I can’t help but questioning his feelings for me or - even worse - I start getting paranoid that he may kill himself. He told me more than once that he never feels suicidal, just apathetic so not to worry. However, I can’t help but texting him and telling him I miss him and I hope he’s ok, but I don’t usually get a reply during these episodes so I really feel left out.
As a partner, what’s the best thing to do/way to deal with him disappearing? Should I not contact him at all knowing that he will come back to me when the episode subsides?
I look forward to getting some insight from other people who struggle (or did struggle) with depression.

I lost my person that day, and as months passed, I noticed my brother seemed sad but was and still is distant from my dad. My brother revealed to me that my dad was having an affair.

My girlfriend tells me we have a new job and I don’t have to worry because we’ll have money from now on. 

Her mom gave her the job. Said she was taking it over and trained her for a month to do so.

So we go clean this huge church with two buildings from 7pm-5am once a week for a month. 

We get the check for $1400 and her mom “changed her mind,” and she tells me she agreed to give her mom $700. I was pissed af. So I told her if she gave me anything less than $700 I would leave her. So I got $700, she gave her mom $700 and she kept nothing. Her mom took the money knowing her daughter was getting none of it. 

About a month passed and all we’ve been doing is fighting and we’re not the same. 

I finally gave her $350 bc I don’t care about the money. So we ended up making $8.75/hour.

Now she and her mom clean the church without me and it’s made me very depressed and feel alienated. We were both so happy to have something that was ours.

And Im frustrated that all this stuff make me not allowed to socialize. Everyone rejects me. And just seems to criticise things that just DONT MATTER. None if my teeth are rotting or look like what youre thinking. Oh and always dry lios from the medical and well all my life. I do masks and more it just doesnt change.

How am I supposed to make my life happen when people just reject me for looks or other reasons that are out of my control. All my spending money goes to medical treatment trying to improve myself and these conditions. 

I dont think I can keep fighting it alone. Whats the point if Im treated like a bum when Im not a bum. In my garage in my building and when you try to fill them in or discuss it they just go “I dont remember sayign that” and it was last time. And you try to address it anyways.

,depression,"I come from a family with no money so I support myself financially 100%. Working to pay rent and bills is exhausting let alone working towards building a career or wealth. I have friends in the same financial position who don't work full time so they can study, they are struggling but they know it will only be a few years until they have a career and can enjoy life. I know that physically I am capable of working and studying and sacrificing comfort to do so, but mentally I can barely handle the stress I am already faced with. I have attempted suicide in the past with medications, taking 30 pills, I had 10 more and knew if I took all of them I would die, but I just took the 30 because there was a part of me that was scared. I fantasise about suicide daily, but I know that when it comes down to it I will stop myself. I know that if I do not work to build a good life, I will live a long painful life spending everyday wishing to die.

,depression,"Can’t get over his past..

Having trouble letting go of my fiance’s past.

Hey there, so I met someone online in the year 2021, and we started dating. It was quite serious and was a commitment to get married eventually. The relationship was short lived since he had an all time low in his life by this time. He lost all his finances, his father met with An accident right in front of him home and slipped into a coma and he felt too much for himself and couldn’t deal with any of it , also because he is autistic I think. He ended up breaking up with me. The same day we broke up, he had a meeting in a different city and since he couldn’t afford a hotel room ended up staying at a colleagues place. They both were drunk , and she “got all over him” and they ended up having sex. Now be says he never wanted it, never planned it or such but it just happened and he regretted it deeply right after. And at this point he never thought we would ever speak again. But he could just not let me go for the next 5 months because he somehow thought he could make the money to come to me. But when he realized he couldn’t at this time and had too much for himself he decided to put a stop to it. Also, he started dating someone in these 5 months to make money off of her and entertained me at the same time. 

Fast forward to a year after , he comes back to my life and we end up meeting for the first time and falling in love all over again. Everything was great for over a year except for some fights here and there. But we were happy. Now we are in long distance for a few months until our marriage and I’m crippled by his past and what he has put me through. I just can’t seem to get over it. 

He is a great human being now, he’s changing so much and developed so much. He has redeemed himself and has come clean about a lot and makes sure I feel safe and secure no matter what. But, I can’t seem to let the past go. And idk what to do anymore. Idk if time will heal or it’ll never get better. Kindly let me know your take.

,depression,"# Passive suicide thoughts

Is there anyone out there who struggles with passive suicide thoughts?

English is not my first language but I will try to explain the best that I can. This is not a post asking for sympathy, I'm simply looking for someone out there who struggles with the same thing and has overcome it/ found a way to excist without it taking over their life.

I'm a 25 year old girl, I have a boyfriend and own an apartment, and have a decent job. Still, I feel like my life has no meaning. I feel that life in general is meaningless, and this world is full of hurt, and I don't understand how I can keep on living. I think about dying every single day, yet I'm not strong enough to go through with it. I don't want to hurt the people around me who do not view the world the same way I do, but I can't stop thinking about the relief of simply not excisting anymore.

I feel that I have so much hatred inside of me and so much anger, both towards myself and humanity itself. People are so cruel, both to other people, to animals, and to the planet. I think the world would be a much better place without humans. And I feel so alone with these thougths, and almost like they're ""illegal"", because humans are viewed as on top of the pyramide.

I see now that this post is just a mess, but I really just need to know if there is anyone out there sharing these thoughts, because I feel so alone. I wish there was a ""stop""-button to life, and that I could be able to end it when I wanted without all the dramatics. That there would be a painless way to go, without doing something that hurts. These thoughts have taken over my life, and even though I'm not ""struggling"", because I am able to function in the day-to-day life, I don't understand how much longer I can keep going with this chaos inside my head.

SO is there anyone out there who has been struggling with this and has found something that helped? A way to find meaning in life or just rewire the brain to be happy again? Or are there any motivational speakers/therapists that are known for struggling with this, but has found a way to erase those thoughts? I hope this reaches someone who can maybe share some advice.

I feel that life in general is meaningless, and this world is full of hurt, and I don&amp;#39;t understand how I can keep on living. I think about dying every single day, yet I&amp;#39;m not strong enough to go through with it. I don&amp;#39;t want to hurt the people around me who do not view the world the same way I do, but I can&amp;#39;t stop thinking about the relief of simply not excisting anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel that I have so much hatred inside of me and so much anger, both towards myself and humanity itself. People are so cruel, both to other people, to animals, and to the planet. I think the world would be a much better place without humans. And I feel so alone with these thougths, and almost like they&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;illegal&amp;quot;, because humans are viewed as on top of the pyramide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see now that this post is just a mess, but I really just need to know if there is anyone out there sharing these thoughts, because I feel so alone. I wish there was a &amp;quot;stop&amp;quot;-button to life, and that I could be able to end it when I wanted without all the dramatics. That there would be a painless way to go, without doing something that hurts. These thoughts have taken over my life, and even though I&amp;#39;m not &amp;quot;struggling&amp;quot;, because I am able to function in the day-to-day life, I don&amp;#39;t understand how much longer I can keep going with this chaos inside my head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SO is there anyone out there who has been struggling with this and has found something that helped? A way to find meaning in life or just rewire the brain to be happy again? Or are there any motivational speakers/therapists that are known for struggling with this, but has found a way to erase those thoughts? I hope this reaches someone who can maybe share some advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you in advance.&lt;/p&gt;

For some context, early into the relationship there was a moment where he expressed how non-attractive I was to him, my skin color/race (I don't believe he's racist, I just think he doesn't find my race's features attractive.), my weight, even my hair, it wasn't at all his type, so despite my best efforts, he wouldn't return any physical affection.

,depression,"turned 15 recently.

  
since it hit summer break, everyone's response is always hanging out with friends or playing games all day. I do that as well, starting from June 12th till now(it was fun) but I hate being pulled back to reality and all the things I need to face sooner after I graduate or go to college. I suffered from symptoms of autism, TICS, adhd and had vivid daydreaming as a coping method which keeps me happy and grateful the whole time and stuff like that. Mother always told me that I'm going to end up nowhere happy as her because I played videogames almost every day(I did study as well, but I hate when she yelled at me, told me to revise and told me how addicted I am. I just want to enjoy my three months worth of holidays well after stressful studies of IGCSE and exams.

maybe I couldn't live without my devices, but I just don't want to be reminded of studying for the first couple of months as I need relaxation time.

and I hate when she tells me that I'd end up begging on the streets because I hated reading actual books(I preferred fanfiction, but she despises when I use the internet to read). I don't like when she encourages me even though I already am reading other things, I absolutely despised on how I'd be brought out of my colorful world where I find escapism. Most of all, since I'm in a British school curriculum, I'd be hitting year 11 after august passes. I overthink a lot and I wonder where I'd end up in college/the future, and that thought scares me and brings me desolation since my mother tells me a lot about my life's failure if I continue my 'addiction' right now, but I simply wish to be left alone so I could turn everything all around and such. 

  
everything's just so blurry for me. I've had people give up on me because I hated studying during a period of time, and my past trauma has managed to glue myself to a screen so I could seek hope from my online friends and games or so. It's like taking drugs, but in a safer way. When the adults ask me which college I'd go, I'd be stressed due to my uncertainity and no one likes that feeling too. 

in conclusion, I wished I could've been the better child our family looks upon. Absolutely despised my mother for being mentally abusive, sometimes physically and how she let the whole family down by being jobless and not having a uni degree right now. Wished that I was actually good at maths and better in chemistry, and wished that my mother never expressed how mad she was when she realized that I hated physics.

,depression,"Hi. I'm struggling at the moment. Let me tell you my story

Up until last summer I was happy. I had never felt lonely or depressed. Since then I moved to another country with my ex. We broke up after about 5 months after moving. I was heart broken then but out of nowhere over very shortly after the breakup. I met another woman and it made me happy again and I was completely honest with her. She knew my situation completely and while I was not able to do everything I wanted due to financial issues of moving to another country while still paying a mortgage back home.  I also have chronic sciatica that is stopping me from being able to enjoy even the most basic of things. I do have surgery coming up to fix the herniated disk so hopefully that will be sorted soon. 

I have gone on a bit of a ramble. Tldr. I am so fucking lonely and I am struggling to make friends. I don't know why it's so hard to make friends since turning 30. I just need some ideas to try make friends that doesnt involve running into another relationship as I don't think I have it in me to be heartbroken again with no friends to speak to. I've been thinking about killing myself daily with almost every other thought. Now I am not going to as honestly the only reason I could think of is that I wouldn't want to upset my family.

I never left that mindset till I met my ex, she showed me that all that was true, but after almost 2 decades of dealing with people who I thought loved and cared about me, just to have them turn once I wasn't useful, it was difficult to believe that for the first time in my life someone loved me unconditionally.

,depression,"***TRIGGER WARNING SUICIDAL IDEATIONS***

Why do I wake up every single morning with suicidal ideations? They used to last me almost most of the day and not go away no matter what I tried to do. Now it only seems to be when I wake up and then it seems to digress through the day, it just seems to disappear and then I don't usually have issues anymore for the rest of the day. Some days though, it still would come and stay throughout the day and or go away and then come back later as well.

Then with my sleeping, even if I sleep 7 or 8 hours, I still wake up tired. Most of the time I wake up extremely tired and fatigued like I haven't slept.

I've also tried going to the hospital several times and there's been issues when I've went there (if you would like to know what happened feel free to ask and I'll tell you). I also went inpatient at the mental ward part of the hospital back in February of this year, but I ended up not getting any help in some issues occurred while I was there (if you would like to know what happened, feel free to ask and I'll tell you).

,depression,"""Are you okay?"" 
Yeah I'm fine.
My brain screaming ""NO I'M NOT OKAY!!!""
I'm the only one that hears it. 
I haven't been okay in 20 years. I distract myself with people that I deem need me and push hard on that. I attach myself to people that are not okay thinking I will be the one that can help them find the place to be okay. A broken man trying to fix broken things hoping it fixes him.
I'm angry all the time and I push it down so nobody will feel it. I plaster a fake smile on and laugh and joke all the while dieing inside and no one sees. Silence is deafening and the only thing that truly scares me is being alone. I starve for attention while I tell people that I'm an introvert. 
I don't ask for help because I feel I can't more over I feel there will be none. I've have honed the craft of mimicking people in situations to fit in to blend and hide amongst the crowd. For acceptance. When I'm comfortable with a person the see the real me but it could take years for that. I don't trust easily and when I do I give my full heart to that person romantic or not. They have seen me and accept me. But every one leave in time. On thier own accord or death. I am left alone and it hurts and it scares me. I leave situations I can no longer deal with. Because it's easier than putting on a smile taking the assault and feel worse than I did before but if they feel better than that's all that matters. It's not them it's me. 
""You are so smart""
""You are so talented""
""You know so much about everything."" 
""You could be doing so much more.""
""You are so calm all the time""
""Nothing phases you.""
I learn things so I have the answer when someone needs it. I put that to practical use so I can help when someone needs it. If I thought I was good enough I might be able to focus long enough to do more. I have to stay calm or I will explode. 
I get stuck in routine because it is the only sense of normalcy I get in my life. It's the only thing that makes me be able to deal. When the routine is disrupted by outside forces (IE not me disrupting it) I don't deal very well. I develop new routines that become the new standard when it is disrupted in a major way. I'm straight forward and expect people to be the same but my mimicking skills gives me a way to be straight forward without upsetting the other person. Most of the time. My brain works differently I'm not ""Normal"" people expect something that I can never give them no matter how hard I try. I do try. People don't know how to talk to me. Or deal with me. They think they can for awhile but realize that they can't and I'm left alone again. At one point I tried to find the solace in the loneliness and I did for awhile. But it doesn't last never does. I attach myself to people and give my heart because I need that connection. And I so badly want to connect. Nothing is as beautiful in this world than looking into someone's eyes and seeing them and being seen by them. That connection can't break not for me. You showed me something that very few have seen. That is the true beauty in this life a connection with another person on the planet. Another person that has wants and desires and hopes and dreams. When someone leaves the beauty leaves with them. But connection is always there. Because when you find them again they feel it to. Even though I seem disconnected in a moment with a person I'm not. I'm there in the room but my mind is in a thousand places also. What you are saying is connecting with those things also and deeming the meaning of all of it. In the middle of a conversation I might say baby elephants are adorable even though we weren't talking about animals at all.

,depression,"This post may sound very dramatic, but it is my true relationship with my condition.

In my early teenage years I had a very bad period and I got depressed. The reason is that during that period I first really realized that albinism would severely limit my life, and since then I've started to experience suicidal thoughts.

I really feel like I'm not understood by anyone when I talk about my disease. I have a severe form of oculus albinism which gives me a 20/100 vision, and a slight form of oculucutanous albinism. I can't even stand at home with windows opened without the sunlight hurting my eyes, and apparently no one seems to take this seriously. I've just stopped talking about this when it happens and just go somewhere else. I also have a lot of difficulties doing simple tasks like using a computer, using a smartphone, reading a book, watching tv and, of course, driving. 

I think I will eventually end my life for this. It's something I have thought a lot about in the past, and sometimes I've got really close to doing that. I started to get psychological visits, but that didn't really help. I know that I have to accept it and that there are a lot of the worst genetic diseases out there, but in the real life it seems like everyone has a normal life, and that hurts. It hurts a lot. I can't accept the fact that I will never see the world as it truly is, or that I will never be able to see the sky without sunglasses, and without my eyes that still hurt while I'm wearing them. 

You can tell me the things that everyone keeps telling me from years, such as that I have to accept it, that I can still have a healthy life etc. I'm just not normal, and what I'm seeing isn't normal.

,depression,"My family is not my comfort zone. It never was. The older I get, the more weight I can feel on my shoulders. My mom has really high expectations of me. Since I was young I would always fight with my mom over everything, even the smallest thing like making a noise while eating. She‘s like a perfectionist and wants me to be like her too. I know she’s always telling me that it’s for my own sake but it’s too much for me to handle. I wasn’t good at school when I was young, so when my grades came out I always got scolded by her. She said things like, „Is it that hard to be good at school?“ „Why can’t you do something that easy?“ Can’t you be someone I can be proud of at least once?“ She does triggered some traumatic feelings of me. Because of what I went through I grew up with low self esteem and the feeling of being afraid of making mistakes. When we moved to another country I did my best with everything. I got better at school and even graduated from a prestigious university with a good degree. I thought maybe now my mom will be proud of me, but her reaction wasn’t like what I expected. She never praised me for my achievements and started to criticize me in other ways. She cares A LOT about what other people think about her. So I had to be the perfect daughter she can brag about. The problem was…I was never good enough for her. I don’t fit the beauty standard and I already know it but getting this told by my own mom always makes me feel hurt. She REALLY CARES A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE’S OPINIONS. I always get comments like “Why are you so fat?” “Did you gained weight again?” “I told you not to eat.” “You’ll never be beautiful if you continue to look this way” It’s not only my weight she cares about but also my face. She even had me do a nose job and a lip surgery to look better. I always have to wear Makeup and dress well when I go out. And she’ll always comment on my outfits like “why are you wearing wide jeans? It makes you look fat“ and even said things like „What are you doing? What will other people think of me because of your actions? They‘ll think I didn’t raised you right.“ I‘m so sick of those comments, there were a few times I wanted to end my life. I can’t be that perfect daughter she expects me to be. And because of that I‘m more fond of my friends than my family. But at the end I got betrayed a few times. Being kind and genuine to others doesn’t mean they’ll be kind and genuine to you. I never learned from the same mistakes until recently. Reality hit me hard.

It never was. The older I get, the more weight I can feel on my shoulders. My mom has really high expectations of me. Since I was young I would always fight with my mom over everything, even the smallest thing like making a noise while eating. She‘s like a perfectionist and wants me to be like her too. I know she’s always telling me that it’s for my own sake but it’s too much for me to handle. I wasn’t good at school when I was young, so when my grades came out I always got scolded by her. She said things like, „Is it that hard to be good at school?“ „Why can’t you do something that easy?“ Can’t you be someone I can be proud of at least once?“ She does triggered some traumatic feelings of me. Because of what I went through I grew up with low self esteem and the feeling of being afraid of making mistakes. When we moved to another country I did my best with everything. I got better at school and even graduated from a prestigious university with a good degree. I thought maybe now my mom will be proud of me, but her reaction wasn’t like what I expected. She never praised me for my achievements and started to criticize me in other ways. She cares A LOT about what other people think about her. So I had to be the perfect daughter she can brag about. The problem was…I was never good enough for her. I don’t fit the beauty standard and I already know it but getting this told by my own mom always makes me feel hurt. She REALLY CARES A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE’S OPINIONS. I always get comments like “Why are you so fat?” “Did you gained weight again?” “I told you not to eat.” “You’ll never be beautiful if you continue to look this way” It’s not only my weight she cares about but also my face. She even had me do a nose job and a lip surgery to look better. I always have to wear Makeup and dress well when I go out. And she’ll always comment on my outfits like “why are you wearing wide jeans? It makes you look fat“ and even said things like „What are you doing? What will other people think of me because of your actions? They‘ll think I didn’t raised you right.“ I‘m so sick of those comments, there were a few times I wanted to end my life. I can’t be that perfect daughter she expects me to be. And because of that I‘m more fond of my friends than my family. But at the end I got betrayed a few times. Being kind and genuine to others doesn’t mean they’ll be kind and genuine to you. I never learned from the same mistakes until recently. Reality hit me hard. I feel like I don’t matter to anyone except they need something from me. I‘m always trying to help or at least be there for the people around me but no one is ever there for me.

,depression,"I guess I wanted to make this post because I want to gain some advice or reassurance in my understanding of why I have experienced mental health issues relating to anxiety and depression for the past 7 years (since I was 18, now 25). I want to share a background of my experience with these issues and hopefully gain some insight to how I should move forward, because it has been a constant struggle. Like everyone's mental health experience, it is unique to them and it is extremely complicated, stemming from an array of different things such as childhood trauma, nutrient deficiency,, microbiome health, etc. 

Background:

Finishing highschool was definitely the trigger to my first anxiety episode. Navigating what I wanted to do with my life was stressful and I felt as if for the first time in my life, I did not have a clear path. At the time, I didn't even know it was anxiety, but during the year after highschool it was like a flip switched inside of me and hasn't been the same since. Not to say there werent times where I was anxious in childhood, because there definitely was, but this was the first time I really felt the physical and mental effects of suffering from anxiety. This was presented in OCD like behavior with repetitive thought patterns, overthinking, physical tension in chest and stomach (like an urge to cry), insomnia and other symptoms of anxiety. I ended up going straight into full time work and struggled these things regularly but would go days or weeks of not feeling symptoms. It was always irregular and I never knew why I was feeling these things. I have always been healthy and conscious of my diet, sleep, exercise and was never abusing drugs or alcohol so it was a bit of a shock when these symptoms “randomly” occurred. I was determined to find an underlying biological or physical reason for these feelings and have and still do try supplements, more exercise, eliminating certain foods, regular sleep etc which all help to an extent but have never actually resolved any issues.

These issues persisted and it was shitty but I was able to manage myself and it never really spiraled until I had a bad insomnia episode a couple of years later. This was a combination of the anxiety I had in general which ended up causing anxiety around going to sleep and they just fed off each other. After really struggling for a couple of months I decided to try medication and was given lexapro. Once the lexapro started working, for the first time in ages I felt a sense of normalcy. I was stable, my random anxious thoughts and feelings in my body were gone, I genuinely felt like the best version of myself. My sleep was good again and I stayed on lexapro for about 9 months before deciding I wanted to come off, thinking I had healed my brain of whatever weird neurological misfirings that caused these problems. I hadnt been to therapy at all at this point but I was so determined that I had cured these problems and didn't want to stay on a medication for whatever reason - I think I was ashamed of being on medication and was also scared of staying on them long term. 

For almost a year after I stayed off medication and continued to try to heal myself naturally. I had improved with understanding these feelings, I had a better grasp of the causes or what my anxious brain thinks that's wrong with my external environment. I finished my degree and was working full time doing something unrelated to my studies and had decided to move cities and also had just been accepted to a serious full time job. The stresses of these triggered an insomnia episode again and I said fuck it, ill go back on the medication. However, this time the lexapro didn't work and for some reason made me feel depressed. I hadn't really understood what depression was like but now with what I know, its closely related to anxiety. Anyway, I moved cities and although my life improved because I made new friends, was enjoying living out of home, moved to a place I really like, felt less lonely I still had these shitty feelings. I came of the lexapro after trying it for 2 months and decided to get prescribed a different medication. I was determined for this one to work and was put on zoloft. The zoloft killed my anxiety but made me even more depressed. My moods were very up and down. Zoloft didnt work for me either and I decided I really needed to go to therapy instead of using a medication (I know, I should of gone to therapy long before any of this but it was hard as I didnt communicate properly to my parents or friends and wanted to solve the issues on my own.

I went for 10 therapy sessions and learnt a lot of information about myself that I didn't know. I believe the stuff I learnt gave me a clearer perspective of the disorder in a way I hadn't seen it. That is, that it has deep roots in my subconscious brain that stemmed from things that happened in childhood. This was helpful for sure and improved some aspects of it but I was still struggling everyday with these feelings. I weaned myself off the zoloft and stayed off it for a couple of months before ending up going back to the doctor in distress asking for a new medication. I tried Lexapro again for 2 months and it didn't work. I was also going through a lot of stress from a breakup, at this time so I think this may have impacted the efficacy of my third time trying lexapro. The lexapro was making me feel shit so I tried prozac. Again, for two months I stayed on prozac and hated it. This one by far made me feel the worst. I felt like a zombie. That was about 4 months ago. Situationally everything has improved and I am a lot happier with things objectively speaking. They are the best they've ever been but I'm still a mess and have this depression/anxiety that will present itself all the time. I am booked into therapy again which I am excited for. But I don't know what to do. I feel like I have tried everything. 

I have read a lot about psilocybin therapy and have used psilocybin many times recreationally but I want to explore a high dose trip alone, and hopefully find some sort of cure to this disease. I understand it's not going to be a quick fix thing but I am losing hope and desperately want to do something to heal myself. I think starting therapy again and doing a big trip will be beneficial. Its fucking annoying that everything in my life is great, yet I will randomly and sporadically get these thoughts and feelings. At the moment it's a lot of depression. I hate how it makes me spiral. I want some advice on whether I should try another medication. I loved the first time I was on it and it worked but i'm afraid of doing the whole trial and error thing and experiencing all the side effects like I did the other times.I want to find something that will work for me and stay on it long term.

,depression,"I don’t know what to do at this point I hate myself SO much.

I’m going into college this August and idk if it’s worth it to go anymore, I feel like I am unworthy of love and I hate myself so much. I’ve never had a relationship and I have no real friends. 

I have a twin sister (I’m also a girl) and we’ve pretty much had the same friends growing up. Back then I thought it was annoying because I hated being paired up with her but now I feel like a burden to her. I know she thinks I’m a loser with no friends (true) and she feels obligated to hang out with me bc of our parents. Throughout high school, I hung out with her and her friends and pretty much just faded into the background. Not a single person was actually friends with me because of me- they only hang out with me because of her.

Genuinely (and I’m not delusional) nobody cares about me; not a single person. I feel worthless and dumb and ugly and unlovable. 

I know everybody is going to say “you’ll meet your true friends in college” but I genuinely feel like I am incapable of making friends. I feel like the more people know about me the closer I’ve pushed them down the inevitable timeline of when they’ll eventually leave me.

I hate who I was. When I still had therapy, that helped me deal with that a little.
And I absolutely loathe what I'm becoming (or not becoming in a sense).

It all just feeds each other and is a kind of vicious cycle it's just exhausting.

My value as a person in this society decreases exponentially.
With time my interest in anything deteriorates.
I only do skinner box NPC things and what keeps me alive. Depersonalization is getting worse. I only feel bitter and empty now.

The constant that is the high expectations laid upon me as a kid stays ever unreachable.

,depression,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for my whole life. I have gotten significantly better, I am able to manage the illness better and it does not affect me in serious ways. I have support from loved ones and a safety plan in case things were to be bad again, but it has not been the case in several years. 



However, there are times I feel myself slipping into a depressive episode and fall back into my bad habits. Recently, I felt myself slipping into a episode, and I mustered the bit of energy I had to let my loved ones know that I needed some space and time alone. I chose to self isolate. The reason was because I needed time to process the emotions and felt like a burden to my loved ones. During this time, I was not able to think rationally and I was very critical of myself and I felt unworthy, ashamed and exhausted. The urge to self isolate hasn't happened in a long time, but I gave into that urge due to the strong emotions. When I felt a bit better after a few days, I reached out again. 



My loved one told me that he did not like this behaviour, and that if I were to self sabotage again he cannot choose to care about me anymore. 

He told me, a mistake only happens once and choosing to isolate, whether it is inconsistent or not, is a choice. If I get the urge to isolate and I act upon it, and there are times I don’t want help from my loved ones, then he just can’t continue to care for me. 

He said I am free to do as I please, withdraw from people, isolate myself. I just cannot expect him to care if I do. 

He said if I cannot allow someone who cares about me to help shoulder the burden of my pain and suffering, then his mental energy is better spent elsewhere.

What he said is completely valid. However, I think of this situation differently.



I think that life is very unpredictable and people will experience a lot of grief and a lot of pain that can make you lose sight of yourself. It can be extremely difficult to reach out for support when the illness is convincing you that you're unworthy. I don't know what will happen in the future, I know that I will probably make the same mistakes again and choose to self isolate. But I also know that during this time, I need my loved ones there for me no matter what. I need people to be there for me when I feel unworthy of love, ESPECIALLY when I feel unworthy of love. The more warmth I am shown, the more strength I will have to get out of the muck. It's a battle with the illness. It's not that I don't want support, it's that I believe I am unworthy of support. I constantly try to fight the negative thoughts that occur when I feel this way, somedays, it's too much for me and I give in and believe them. 



Now, I am very upset. I am sad because someone who I love very much and loves me very much said that to me. I have to accept that I will probably make the same mistake again, because I'm on the road to recovery, and I have to accept that if I do, he won't be there for me.

,depression,"Idk if this is the right place to share this, but I think it might be the only place. 

This happened around 20+ years ago now,  back when I was in my first or second year of high school. I was getting bullied every single day, had no friends, nobody to talk to about it, and was an absolute ball of emotions.    
Most of the time I was just pure rage, because how the hell could the teachers turn a blind eye, when the bullies weren't even being subtle? So many kids bullied me, that the teachers just made the mathematical decision that it was better to ignore one child, than punish 5+, and ruin their education. 

So one day, I was at my lowest, and decided to end it all. The issue was, I hated the pain of being cut, drowning wouldn't work because I kept coming up for air, and I couldn't tie any knots. 

So I decided to use my own school tie.... This is when it gets funny.

I had one of those closets that's built into the wall, with a shelf and a bar for hanging clothes hangers...so my absolute dumbo brain, decided to put my tie through the bar, hold onto the other end of the tie with both hands.... And lift my legs off the ground.... Like a god damn looney tunes character. 

I only dangled for a few seconds, before I lost my grip and came crashing down with an almighty thud. 

It was at that point, that I realised how unbelievably dumb what I tried to do was. Not because I wanted to live, or because it didn't make sense to punish myself for other people's actions. Only because the way I tried, was so cartoon levels of dumb. So I'm just lay on the ground, my school tie messed up laughing my ass off. 


Sadly when I went downstairs, and tried to casually tell my mom that I had just tried to hang myself, the timing could not of been worse. She was right in the middle of watching a talk show about depressed kids who had tried to kill themselves. So when I told her what I had just done she yelled at me for making it up, saying that the kids on TV had genuine problems, and I was grounded and sent back to my room. 


It wasn't till over a decade later that I told her what I had tried to do, and reminded her of how she had yelled at me. Honestly I think even a decade later from telling her, she still hasn't forgiven herself.

But for me, it's weirdly one of my funniest memories. The time I tried to off myself like a god damn looney tunes character. Like I was gonna pass out, yet somehow keep holding the tie. 

I still have depression, though it's hard to tell some days, due to all the genuinely legitimate reasons we all have to be sad, and not want to get out of bed in the morning (like if my life was great and I felt this way, then it would be obvious it's depression, but even people without depression would agree that life sucks right now) but I never tried to kill myself ever again, thanks to how dumb I felt when I did try.

,depression,"My partner has been on vacation for two weeks and recently returned. When he was gone, I had a depressive episode (honestly, not my worst one, but still), and long story short, it led to us almost breaking up over the phone. His main reasoning was that he already ""deals"" with it with his mom, has had bad experiences in the past, and is going off that. Essentially just saying that having a depressive partner would be too ""difficult/hard"" for him to deal with, even though he hasn't made a huge attempt to cater to me personally. This is the first time he's seen me like this.

A lot happened in between, but I ended up basically saying that we aren't breaking up until we (he) try. But now, especially after summarizing it, Im wondering if I should've just let him leave. I'm wondering if, at the next difficult roadblock, he's just going to be like, ""This is too hard; I'm out."" I don't feel as secure as I used to, as sure of his love for me, and I'm worried about things progressing because I don't want to be a year in, having poured so much into the relationship, and he leaves because things get hard. 

Some context: His mother also has depression and is a lot more volatile with it than I am. Same with past girlfriends. About 3-4 days ago, she asked him to help kill herself. His trip has also been overstimulating (his words) and not as pleasant as he wanted. Yes, I'm in the process of getting help; I need money to pay for therapy and to see a psychiatrist, but that's my number one priority. I don't expect him to sacrifice everything to try and fix me, but as my partner, I do expect him to be there for me and ride out the storm with me. It's only been about 4 months, so I didn't expect him to know all my ins and outs, but I did expect him to stay and try, and if I hadn't stepped in, I feel he wouldn't have. 

I also want to note that he has been an absolutely amazing boyfriend prior to this (opens every door for me, pays for almost everything, always compliments me, good morning texts, the list goes on) so this really through me. It feels like we should just call it quits but I'm wondering if there's any possible alternative.

&lt;p&gt;I just needed to get that out. I have no family or friends to turn to, I’m so alone. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi, idk how to intro this but oh well. 
Let me be clear I’m not looking for any sympathy, trust me when I say that I messed up my life it was no one else so sympathy will get me no where, to be fair I just don’t have anyone in my life who’s actually willing to listen to me so here we are.

Firstly let me start out by saying that I am a Christian, have been for my whole life. For those that are still here thank you. Now that we’ve ripped that bandage off where to really start. 
I guess I could start with the fact that I am alone, totally alone. I have people, just not people who want to pour into me without getting a lot more in return. As it stands I can’t remember the last time I actually opened up about how sick I feel, not physically but mentally. 

I have 1 friend she’s really awesome, she’s my best friend, I love her to death but her parents hate me. They think I’m turning their daughter into a lesbian and we only really get to hang out for 1-2 hrs at a time every other week and since I started going to another church I barely see her anymore. I miss her a lot but she has her own issues and I know I have no right to be selfish, her issues are far worse then mine trust me I know that beyond a shadow of a doubt but sometimes it feels like we never really talk about my life. I’ve told her some stuff about me and to be fair she has sat with me when I cried on the phone with her but whenever we talk now she’s always complaining about her job and her family because they suck. I love her to death but sometimes I just let the phone ring until I feel bad enough to call her back because I don’t want to continue to hear about her problems when I feel like I’m suffocating from the inside out. I love her, I really do please believe me that I would die for this girl and I want her to be my maid of honor one day but I wish I could just talk to her about me, and she wouldn’t just shrug it off and then move onto her own issues. I need help and she’s my only friend but it feels like she doesn’t want to listen to me because she doesn’t know how to handle it when I have stuck my neck out for her a million times. I was there for her when her grandfather died and her dog got hit by a train, and I did her hair for her graduation twice and I have always always done my best to be there when she needed me. Not to mention due to her parents abhorrence of me we can’t ever see each other anymore and talking on the phone will never replace being with her in person. I know it sounds selfish but I’m not trying to be. With her parents hating me and causing her life to suck i feel like i can’t help anyways but i care for her so much i just want to get her out of the situation she’s in but I’m also suffering so I can’t really help her.

As I mentioned I stopped going to the church she went to. I left for a multitude of reasons, that church ruined my life although in the situation I wouldn’t blame them. My parents were both pretty prominent figures in that church before their reputation was smashed into the ground because of me, granted I was a child but If I hadn’t made the choice i made maybe I would’ve had a better life, it all stems from that place god if i could go back and tear that girl a new one i would but I can’t so whatever. Anyways all that crap happened, really traumatic stuff but that’s not what is happening presently it’s just to set up back story.
Presently i attend church with my parents but just a few months ago i was attending that other church. I liked it for a while, i met my friend there and we had a few fun trips and stuff but because of the incident i never had any other friends really. I had one other that was friends with me and my bsf but she ended up turning on us, it hurt my bsf more then me tbh but I caused that too, i started some stupid fight and the girl never really talked to us again. I had another friend but it turns out she was just using me to find out more about my life and the crap 10 years ago so she could feed it to the church gossip strip so i broke it off with her. Then i just had me and my bsf which was ok although i never saw her because she was working or just not going to church. I was alone, so i tried therapy with the pastor. At about that time my bsf stopped attending because of family stuff and i had a breakdown in the parking lot on new years, it was bad. I only went to a few sessions before i gave up on trying because it seemed like there was no help for someone like me.
I have been going to this new church (not new I’ve attended before but i was mentally unwell and still am) and it seems to be ok for now but I don’t really trust anyone, it was the same at the last church, i had no one, or i was shouldering everyone else as a burden. I’m just tired not physically but mentally , i have been for a loooooooooong time but when i tell anyone that they don’t get it at all. 

Another thing, I’ve graduated high school, it should be exciting but it’s not. (This is the part where i messed up my own life, pls do not feel bad for me about this particular thing lol) I’m a fraud so to speak, i attended regular school up till the beginning of highschool when I started to do homeschool. I got ok grades at the regular school and when i started to do homeschool i guess my parents just kinda thought i was cool to just do it by myself, not sure but i was given a laptop and cds to do and for the first year it was ok, i occasionally cheated but nothing serious, just looking up the really difficult questions on my phone or whatever. It was when i got to the end of 8th grade where i found the grade books my mom hid. I took them of course (stupid teenage brain riddled with depression) anyways i cheated my way through the rest of the grades like big time, I wasn’t learning anything at all. It was easy really, my parents took their hands off my education because they were busy with work and again i was alone. My dad had big dreams for me, still does, but i can only remember one time where he actually helped me do my school work and that was when i was still in regular school, but when i was homeschooled all he wanted was my report card. Good grades means good daughter i guess lol. Anyways i screwed up obviously. I graduated but i knew nothing and by the time i was in 11th grade i realized this but I couldn’t do anything but keep cheating to pass the grade so daddy dearest didn’t think anything weird. At some point my mom found out but she never told my dad and instead just helped me cheat by giving me the books (maybe she felt like i was just using them to grade myself or that she just couldn’t tell my dad because he is an angry individual anyways, he might just kill me if he found out lol.) 
I remember one time where i was in my room with headphones on “studying” and my mom tried knocking but she couldn’t get my attention so she came in and we smoothed it out but i guess my dad heard my mom knocking and decided to come to my room, slam the door open, yell at me as i cried and then pulled on the handle with his foot at the bottom of the door pulling the handle so much its still loose to this day. He asked me about it once and i told him the truth but he just said he didn’t remember. So anyways safe to say i have no one i can beg to help me with this and if i did i fear society would kill me to lol. Like i said don’t feel bad for me this is my own fault. 
He scares me, he can be happy one minute and the next he can snap at me or my mom like a rabid dog, i begged him to help me with my resume a million times since he was a supervisor at a medical facility but he just told me to do it and he’d look over it but he never did, so i just did it myself and nobody wants to hire me which is making him upset with me lol, he asks everyday if i found another job and that i should go to the places and stuff but I don’t want to even listen to him since he can’t take a second to just be a dad, i think he doesn’t want to be my dad. I don’t know why, or what i did maybe i remind him. Of himself with all my mental issues but i just wish i had someone to show me what to do now. Tbh i think my only solution is to take a bunch of pills and forget about this haha. Just end it all while i have some dignity left. No money, no friends, no life, I’m just so alone and there’s no magic solution so guess what, ill just return to my fathers throne, end it all , all the pain and hurt i inflicted upon myself then my dad can miss me when I’m gone. 

Anyways thanks for listening to my ramble and please don’t feel bad for me i did this to myself.

I love her to death but sometimes I just let the phone ring until I feel bad enough to call her back because I don’t want to continue to hear about her problems when I feel like I’m suffocating from the inside out. I love her, I really do please believe me that I would die for this girl and I want her to be my maid of honor one day but I wish I could just talk to her about me, and she wouldn’t just shrug it off and then move onto her own issues. I need help and she’s my only friend but it feels like she doesn’t want to listen to me because she doesn’t know how to handle it when I have stuck my neck out for her a million times. I was there for her when her grandfather died and her dog got hit by a train, and I did her hair for her graduation twice and I have always always done my best to be there when she needed me. Not to mention due to her parents abhorrence of me we can’t ever see each other anymore and talking on the phone will never replace being with her in person. I know it sounds selfish but I’m not trying to be. With her parents hating me and causing her life to suck i feel like i can’t help anyways but i care for her so much i just want to get her out of the situation she’s in but I’m also suffering so I can’t really help her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned I stopped going to the church she went to. I left for a multitude of reasons, that church ruined my life although in the situation I wouldn’t blame them. My parents were both pretty prominent figures in that church before their reputation was smashed into the ground because of me, granted I was a child but If I hadn’t made the choice i made maybe I would’ve had a better life, it all stems from that place god if i could go back and tear that girl a new one i would but I can’t so whatever. Anyways all that crap happened, really traumatic stuff but that’s not what is happening presently it’s just to set up back story.
Presently i attend church with my parents but just a few months ago i was attending that other church. I liked it for a while, i met my friend there and we had a few fun trips and stuff but because of the incident i never had any other friends really. I had one other that was friends with me and my bsf but she ended up turning on us, it hurt my bsf more then me tbh but I caused that too, i started some stupid fight and the girl never really talked to us again. I had another friend but it turns out she was just using me to find out more about my life and the crap 10 years ago so she could feed it to the church gossip strip so i broke it off with her. Then i just had me and my bsf which was ok although i never saw her because she was working or just not going to church. I was alone, so i tried therapy with the pastor. At about that time my bsf stopped attending because of family stuff and i had a breakdown in the parking lot on new years, it was bad. I only went to a few sessions before i gave up on trying because it seemed like there was no help for someone like me.
I have been going to this new church (not new I’ve attended before but i was mentally unwell and still am) and it seems to be ok for now but I don’t really trust anyone, it was the same at the last church, i had no one, or i was shouldering everyone else as a burden. I’m just tired not physically but mentally , i have been for a loooooooooong time but when i tell anyone that they don’t get it at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing, I’ve graduated high school, it should be exciting but it’s not. (This is the part where i messed up my own life, pls do not feel bad for me about this particular thing lol) I’m a fraud so to speak, i attended regular school up till the beginning of highschool when I started to do homeschool. I got ok grades at the regular school and when i started to do homeschool i guess my parents just kinda thought i was cool to just do it by myself, not sure but i was given a laptop and cds to do and for the first year it was ok, i occasionally cheated but nothing serious, just looking up the really difficult questions on my phone or whatever. It was when i got to the end of 8th grade where i found the grade books my mom hid. I took them of course (stupid teenage brain riddled with depression) anyways i cheated my way through the rest of the grades like big time, I wasn’t learning anything at all. It was easy really, my parents took their hands off my education because they were busy with work and again i was alone. My dad had big dreams for me, still does, but i can only remember one time where he actually helped me do my school work and that was when i was still in regular school, but when i was homeschooled all he wanted was my report card. Good grades means good daughter i guess lol. Anyways i screwed up obviously. I graduated but i knew nothing and by the time i was in 11th grade i realized this but I couldn’t do anything but keep cheating to pass the grade so daddy dearest didn’t think anything weird. At some point my mom found out but she never told my dad and instead just helped me cheat by giving me the books (maybe she felt like i was just using them to grade myself or that she just couldn’t tell my dad because he is an angry individual anyways, he might just kill me if he found out lol.) 
I remember one time where i was in my room with headphones on “studying” and my mom tried knocking but she couldn’t get my attention so she came in and we smoothed it out but i guess my dad heard my mom knocking and decided to come to my room, slam the door open, yell at me as i cried and then pulled on the handle with his foot at the bottom of the door pulling the handle so much its still loose to this day. He asked me about it once and i told him the truth but he just said he didn’t remember. So anyways safe to say i have no one i can beg to help me with this and if i did i fear society would kill me to lol. Like i said don’t feel bad for me this is my own fault. 
He scares me, he can be happy one minute and the next he can snap at me or my mom like a rabid dog, i begged him to help me with my resume a million times since he was a supervisor at a medical facility but he just told me to do it and he’d look over it but he never did, so i just did it myself and nobody wants to hire me which is making him upset with me lol, he asks everyday if i found another job and that i should go to the places and stuff but I don’t want to even listen to him since he can’t take a second to just be a dad, i think he doesn’t want to be my dad. I don’t know why, or what i did maybe i remind him. Of himself with all my mental issues but i just wish i had someone to show me what to do now. Tbh i think my only solution is to take a bunch of pills and forget about this haha. Just end it all while i have some dignity left. No money, no friends, no life, I’m just so alone and there’s no magic solution so guess what, ill just return to my fathers throne, end it all , all the pain and hurt i inflicted upon myself then my dad can miss me when I’m gone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways thanks for listening to my ramble and please don’t feel bad for me i did this to myself.
Hope you guys have a good day :)&lt;/p&gt;

I have not been able to hold onto a single friendship in so long. I really think that people just tolerate me at best.

I see people have extremely close friendships with people who share the same interests, have children around the same age, having a good time together, all that lovely stuff. But for the life of me I cannot hold onto a friendship.

Just to show a little self awareness of my flaws, I feel like I am never consistent as a person and can having changing opinions everyday(like how I feel about a coworker, controversial issues, my approaches to situations) I am very aware that I am all over the place. But I don't have bad intentions. I do my best to consider what would hurt others and what should or should not do/say. Sometimes my honesty is not appreciated, totally understandable. But does that make me so undesirable to be around?

Just as an extended example, I became friends through my work, since I work remote but even they avoid contact with me or keep it at a minimum.

I know that I got upset at each of these friends at one point because they have said something hurtful to me when I just try to barely exist around them. Also, if I have a moment of success I feel like they take it as a threat and make snide comments about how they are struggling with a task they have work as a response. They have had their successes too and I tell them good job let them know that they deserved the praise they get. They complain about their teams and I would listen to them and try to console them or try to give advice but they would ignore me or just would be dismissive in general. 

I even at one point was telling one of those friends that I really missed one of our old coworkers and was getting emotional about it and they said that I shouldn't care since this person didn't give a shit about me... later this person denied ever saying something like this when I brought it up months later.

I won't deny that recently I started saying snide stuff back because I have kinda had enough and just returned the attitude. But now that made it even worse between us.

I don't know what to do anymore but I know I complain about person A with person B and then person B will slowly just not want to talk to me anymore either. Like I have no one to confide it at all. I feel like if someone says/does something I am not allowed to talk about it cause then I am just the ball of negativity and no one wants to be around me. What do I do? I feel like there isn't a single soul out there that gives a shit about me.

Is it me? Like am I just a piece of shit? Am I just so fucking unlikeable?

Edit: To add about the hobbies, I hate competitiveness to my core. It makes me anxious and I don't like feeling that. But whenever I want to share a hobby why do I feel like people want to compete with that hobby? Kinda like my cooking is better than yours, playing games (in a team) but competing to show who is better in skill. I just want to have fun. I don't want to talk about whose is better.

,depression,"do you ever think back to a time when you were happy? i do all the fucking time, it hurts so much to exist now

when my mother took care of me and took me everywhere to make me happy

when i had a loving girlfriend who promised me a bright future, a marriage, children, a life worth living and working for

when i was passing school with the highest grades and honors, energy in me to do my best and work to my career

slowly losing everything, watching your life collapse in front of you, and you sit there, with no control, and all you can do is cry

i now take care of my mother who isn’t as well now with constant medications, cries in front of me, and worsens every year

my girlfriend broke up with me 4 months ago (been together for half a decade) because she couldn’t do long distance anymore, told me she doesn’t have enough love for me, and doesn’t want to see me

and now im barely passing college, failed a class, lost a scholarship, and i don’t give a fuck about graduating or any career

i lost everything, i have constant nightmares of my girlfriend leaving me, i loved her more than anything in the world and she meant everything to me, she was my hope to a happier life

i’ve been crying everyday for months, often research suicide and read posts on reddit about them, i tried everything to get better (gym, hang out with friends, hobbies, every fucking thing) and nothing works, i feel worse

im afraid of being alone and i know ill have no one left soon, the only reason why im still here is because i dont want to hurt my mother more than she already is if i were to disappear

sometimes i feel like screaming, i hate that i have no control over my life anymore, i cant do anything, all i can do is sit and wait until i lose the last few people i have left

i wish i could just disappear, i dont wanna cry anymore, i dont wanna have tormenting thoughts anymore, i dont want nightmares anymore, i wish i could be happy

&lt;p&gt;when my mother took care of me and took me everywhere to make me happy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when i had a loving girlfriend who promised me a bright future, a marriage, children, a life worth living and working for&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when i was passing school with the highest grades and honors, energy in me to do my best and work to my career&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;slowly losing everything, watching your life collapse in front of you, and you sit there, with no control, and all you can do is cry&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i now take care of my mother who isn’t as well now with constant medications, cries in front of me, and worsens every year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;my girlfriend broke up with me 4 months ago (been together for half a decade) because she couldn’t do long distance anymore, told me she doesn’t have enough love for me, and doesn’t want to see me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and now im barely passing college, failed a class, lost a scholarship, and i don’t give a fuck about graduating or any career&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i lost everything, i have constant nightmares of my girlfriend leaving me, i loved her more than anything in the world and she meant everything to me, she was my hope to a happier life&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i’ve been crying everyday for months, often research suicide and read posts on reddit about them, i tried everything to get better (gym, hang out with friends, hobbies, every fucking thing) and nothing works, i feel worse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im afraid of being alone and i know ill have no one left soon, the only reason why im still here is because i dont want to hurt my mother more than she already is if i were to disappear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;sometimes i feel like screaming, i hate that i have no control over my life anymore, i cant do anything, all i can do is sit and wait until i lose the last few people i have left&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i wish i could just disappear, i dont wanna cry anymore, i dont wanna have tormenting thoughts anymore, i dont want nightmares anymore, i wish i could be happy&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I lost my twin brother when we were 7. It’s been  12 years now! After my sweet brother left this earth, I have had this urge to leave too.

My father used to say that when one twin d!es the other shall follow. I’m not sure if that is true anymore, but surely he must be right, since I have not truly smiled since I lost him.

 I can’t explain the type of grief I feel anymore.
Every birthday is a reminder of my loss and I feel guilty. I feel guilty for growing up!

I feel like he would have loved living, he would have loved growing up instead my parents lost their son and got stuck with a bipolar daughter.
Since I look identical to him all these years my mother couldn’t even look at me without crying.

She used to make me dress into his clothes when she would miss him asking me to tell her that he was okay. I haven’t existed since I lost him. I didn’t realise how much he protected me all these years and he even passed away protecting me. I feel guilty for how my mind is! 

If I could, I would change places with him; I want to change places with him. I feel like a ghost that stole another persons’ lifepath.

I had a best friend she was always there for me. She understood me and never made me feel like I needed to be someone else. I loved her existence everything about her was beautiful. I moved away and she passed at 15! 

It’s been 4 years now. I feel jealous of them, I know how messed up that is but I feel jealous. I miss her!

I have trouble keeping friends now (terrified if I am a curse) and maintaining relationships. I had someone in my life who loved me for me but of course even he got scared when I got into a depressive episode for the first time.

What’s the point anymore!? I am 19 years old and the thought of having to exist for another decate sounds dreadful enough.

,depression,"I'm 17, from Turkey and I just dont know what will make me happy. I have a roof atop my head, a cozy bed and food and water. If I say I was sad it would be shameful wouldnt it? Millions of people over the world are much poorer than I am, they are in the middle of wars they don't even have anything to do with, many people have shitty parents, live in shitty places, have no friends, are oppressed, yet they still try holding on to life, they still work hard to live and stay alive. They try brushing off their problems and continue their lives.

And we have me, complaining about some bullshit. Do I even have the right to complain? I should be disgusted at myself for even thinking of a possibilty of suicide. How can I do that while there are millions who are in worse conditions than me right? And my parents, they have fed me and took care of me for my whole life and going away without returning anything would be disrespectful to them right? Or is it already their fault for bringing me to this world. Maybe I shouldnt feel indebted to them because they wanted to make another child because of their selfishness and them wanting another kid and nobody asked me my opinion about being born. So they are supposed to take care of me and feed me, because they themselves wanted to make a child so its their duty to do so right? I honestly don't know which one I should feel. I guess my brother wasnt enough for them though, I know that at least.

I have lots of friends, they are all good people, but not even a SINGLE one of them will accept me for who I really am. I don't even know what I am by the way. I am certain of a few things though. I was born into a male body. I know that I like my hair long, and I like having bangs, I like learning about makeup, I like feminine clothing, I know that I hate my masculine body, I hate my body hair, I hate my thick eyebrows that most of my guy friends envy, I hate that I'm as tall as I am, and I know that I feel that something just isn't right. Am I trans? I don't know, maybe I am. But who cares about the labels, I just know that I want to live the way I want to. My friends though? They aren't willing to accept me. No way am I EVER going to open up. Most of my friends are Muslims, even those that aren't, they hate everything related to lgbtq+. I was an hypocrite when one of my closest friends was proudly talking to me about burning a rainbow flag in the street. and I laughed at it. I have no place in the lgbtq+ community because I am not proud about who I am. I can't proudly defend my real thoughts, and I'm supposed to live up to my father and friends' expectations of being some big muscular dominant male or some shit. It's been 13 months since I started going to the gym. I'm stronger than most of those friends. They respect me. But what if they knew that deep down I wanted to keep my hair down, and learn more about makeup? Why do they care even? It's my body isn't it.

Hormone therapy? Maybe hitting up a psychologist? Or a therapist? I don't know how to. I don't know about any of these things. I know that I am not opening up to my parents about any of this. Forget gender, but I am not even saying a single word about having symptoms of clinical depression. I was the hypocrite who laughed and agreed with my father when he proclaimed that depression is some bullshit created by the west to disrupt our progression. I thought my brother was more sane. He says that Turkey is a country bound by its customs and religion. He says that he supports lgbtq+, religious freedom, he says he wants to change how the country is. Yesterday, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. I got tired of hating myself and suddenly losing all joy whenever I looked at my reflection, in the phone, in the mirror, wherever and whatever. I watched some videos, grabbed a scissor, and cut some tall bangs to cover my large forehead and my receding hairline (at this age, I know). I got out of the bathroom, my brother saw me, he started laughing. ""What, u transitioning or something?"" ""You look like a girl, its awful."". Yeah, they are all supportive of modernising or whatever unless it comes to someone they know. My mother is probably like that also. I am not gonna open up to anyone I know, like, ever.

One of my friends saw my hair. He said that he fucking hated it. He said that he would pay for my haircut and he said that he was gonna arrange a barber next week. What about my opinion? You haven't asked me? He said that I hadn't had a relationship ever, and with hair like that, I wouldn't ever get one either. Who cares? I don't cut my hair, I don't look after myself, I don't go to the gym and build a body just to get in some fake relationship that's all about looks. And this guy had long hair for years mind you. Now that a few months ago he was clean shaven, he somehow turned into a guy who hates long hair? ""Friends"" right. I like his company nevertheless. Some other friend saw me. He would oftenly joke about how I would look great in feminine clothing, and that I should ""open an onlyfans"". Hilarious jokes I know, I never found them funny. He hated the hair the most. He angrily said that I should hide that shitty hair. I thought you were with me though? You joked about feminine clothing because of my long hair but if I was to actually wear a skirt, I believe you would get me out of your life and hate me. I sent a friend whom I opened up about these feelings I had a photo. He said I was mentally ill. He assumed that I was ""turned to normal"" after I started hitting the gym. Well, the one dude who I thought would help me throughout this was also turned against me now. Really good being alone. Sure I got friends, but in reality I don't have ANYONE whom I can talk about my real feelings. Oh yea, I also had that one dude. He ""was"" pansexual. He used to help me, but he said that he turned into a Muslim and he was only a pansexual because he was a kid. He was ""normal"" now, he said. He used to preach us about loving everyone because he watched vinland saga (an anime about basically having no enemies). One time we were talking, he said that he was homophobic. I asked, you used to say that you hated no people, and what about gay people then? They can't control who they love or not? He said that he didn't consider them as ""people"" to begin with. So yeah, I am, in fact, alone in reality.

Maybe I should just buzzcut my hair. My hair is the only thing that binds me to my true self I feel like. If I cut my hair, would I forget about the gender dysmorphia and become a true man? Or will the dysmorphia kill me and I would be even more depressed and would hate myself even more? My friends would like me more that's for sure. But it's not worth it. Maybe it is, I don't know. I don't have the balls to take such a leap anyway.

Next year, I'm going to have an exam. That single exam basically singlehandedly decides which college we will be going to in Turkey. All our lives, bound by 1 single exam. I want to be an artist. I aim for graphic design in a good college here. I won't be able to do it though. The stress started hitting me already. I have only a year, so many people are ahead of me. People who go to courses, have lessons about art. I am here with only my self-made talent. I am supposed to work without sleep on art for an exam a year later. I hate it. I really enjoy drawing, but the whole year will be a nightmare. An older friend of mine. He committed suicide because of this exam. The pressure was too much for him. (There's no suicide hotline in Turkey btw, as a side note) My brother took the exam a few years ago. His routine was waking up 6 am, 2 hours of studying, 8 am to 4 pm was school, 4 pm to 8 pm was cram school. 8 pm to 10 pm was studying and he slept after. This was his routine for a WHOLE YEAR. He got into the college he wanted, he also finished grade as the top of the school. I know that I don't have this in me. I can't study this much, even if it's drawing. My father just barely agreed with me after weeks of arguments that he would allow me to go to art school. If I can't get in this year, I'm fucked.

I feel like an entitled brat. I've seen the posts here. People are going through so much worse things than me. I'm an asshole to even have suicidal thoughts right? I tried self harming today. I grabbed some knife, cut through my thigh. It hurt, there was blood. I felt nothing after it. I don't know what I was expecting. Maybe I just gaslit myself into depression? Whatever, I am not doing that again. I don't know what I'm expecting posting this here. If there is a karma limit its all for nothing anyway. If there isn't , I would most likely get a few responses anyway. I know I wouldn't read through this bullshit block of text. Venting feels good sometimes though. I don't know. I don't know what I should do. I have much more to write, but who cares anyway. I don't even care enough to write them down myself. Whatever, even if I don't get replies, it felt good to write this anyway. Lol, my first post got removed without any message or anything already.

,depression,"TL:DR: I think my depression is seen as an inconvenience to husband and I’m constantly scared he will leave me if I’m not happy wife facade 

TW: sibling loss, suicide

Me (28F) and my husband (30M) have been married for seven years. A lot happens in that time. Good, bad, ugly. Overall I feel our relationship is straight out of a love story. There’s always going to be bumps in relationships but we’ve always been able to eventually communicate and fix anything that’s not quite working 

Well last year, I lost a sibling unexpectedly to suicide. Not sure how many people have experienced grief on top of regular ole depression but suffice it to say it has been rough. A rollercoaster of emotions and everyday being different. I feel we’ve navigated it as best we could and overall my husband has been supportive. 

Lately my own depression has gotten very bad. Like not leave my bed, loss of appetite bad. And I feel my husband doesn’t understand. I don’t feel like I’m given any grace during this time period. And I really don’t think he does it from a malicious place I just don’t think he understands severe mental health issues or how best to support someone. Which I get. I don’t expect him to be my therapist. But I do expect him to be a support system for me and I just don’t feel that. 

I don’t know if I’m just in my own head or what but it really feels like my depressive episodes are inconveniences to him. For example, past 48 hours have been awful. Something not done by either of us pushed me over the edge and every feeling came spilling out. Including how dark my thoughts are right now. I mean very concerning thoughts. I think it caught him off guard and I just went to bed. Today we tried to watch tv and I dragged myself out of bed to do so. I was snort laughing which happens sometimes and it felt so good to feel the little glimpses of joy that are so rare. He told me to stop because the sound was stressing me out. Knowing and seeing that I hadn’t smiled in two fucking days. 

I blew up at him and he tried to backtrack by saying he thought I was choking or something (obvious lie and doesn’t want to own up) 

And it just got me thinking about how I don’t feel like I can turn to him to support. And that my mental health will always be an annoyance to him. And I’m so scared he will leave me if I let myself fall to deep into these feelings. 

Idk what to do. I can’t imagine life without him I love him more than anything. but I’m finding myself even more depressed over the fact that I’m basically alone in this struggle. 

How do I have a successful relationship with someone when I’m in such a dark place. What can I tell him to do to be supportive. Idk how to navigate this 

FWIW, I am medicated and try to do a lot of things at home to keep my mental health good. haven’t gone to therapy as I moved states and finding a new one sucks.

Hello, im a 17 years old girl with lots of trauma. For context my mom (40f) and my dad (38m) have their own traumas which are connected with their own parents. half of my family has mental issues and alcoholism. anyway, lets go to my story, when i was 7, i went to 1st grade of elementary school (im from Europe, i will not say what country). My dad picked his 10 hour long work, yes he’s working 10h per day. Im seeing him maybe 10 min per day for 10 years now. My dad is abusive emotionally towards me and sometimes my mom. For example, on my 14 bday he told me that he hates me and he never loved me cuz i didn’t went to school that day. And he’s always yelling at me that he spends money on my therapist, psychiatrist and meds. he hates the fact that i have LOTS of mental illnesses. Also i was bullied my WHOLE life in school, thats why i have my school online now. Plus, im not basic AT ALL from my appearance, and he’s always laughing at me how ugly i am. When i was a kid and i wanted his help he was yelling at me and telling me how stupid i am. Thats why when i was 11 years old i started sh and i was suicidal, and nothing changed to this day. On the other hand, my mom is drinking so much and she has alcohol issues. And she’s always yelling at me that its not true that she has issues with alcohol. Plus, shes never protecting me from my dad. For example, yesterday i came home crying cuz people were laughing at me on the street cuz of my looks and overall im extremely suicidal since 1 month. (i had suicide attempt 2 years ago and i want to repeat it) And my mom was complaining at me that im weak. Plus she told me that she have REAL trauma and problems and she’ll die cuz of me. Plus she’s always yelling at me that she’ll close me in mental asylum. honestly? i have nobody. my grandma which i was extremely close with died 4 years ago, she was only 52 years old. i have enough. i want to kms. and i feel like my parents are right. Is my trauma valid or i am overreacting? (obviously they’re examples cuz worse things happened with my parents)

,depression,"Just when I thought I had gotten better I get down to my lowest. All the inconveniences and problems just add up and suddenly I'm trying to numb my pain with binge drinking again. I try to keep myself occupied but most forms of entertainment just don't do it for me anymore. I recently started exercising again but the days where I really struggle I just can't bring myself to do anything but lay around and get drunk, its really the only time life feels bearable. 

Something a lot of people don't talk about is how hard it is to maintain or gain new relationships as an adult.

I'm an 18M, and would probably be graduating in due time. I have antisocial and have an extreme anxiety as of late, and i have been depressed for nearly 6 months now. Ever since then, my life has been a constant downhill, and it looks like that it wouldn't be stopping. To the eyes of someone not close to me, I appear to be content with life and being able to help people in any way i can. Now, I just don't know anymore.

There are certainly a number of factors in why I have been depressed. But i want to discuss right now is what would eventually turn into losing of my closest friends. I have a feeling that in due time i will be losing all of my best friends, and it will be because of all of my wrongdoings. On our friend group, I was unknowingly making offensive jokes, thinking that it was that on that stage of being friends where we could tell some jokes and would just laugh it off. Without me knowing until recently, I have actually been offending one of my female friends that we would call ""Jewel"" for the time being
















It all started about 10 months ago, i was just starting a sense of depression feels like. Ever since grade school, I haven't made the one that i can truly call a friend since I have been switching schools every 3 years. When I went to my 11th grade, I only have 1 goal: to have tons of friends whom i could bond with even if we go separate ways to our dream colleges and future careers (ik my goal is a bit cliche but stay with me on this one). On the 1st month, I have met my future best friend, that for the sake of anonymity, we will call him ""Alan."" Alan was like the brother I never had. We had a lot of a common interest, and would be even be not exaggerating to call it too much. From the shows we watch, the games we play, hell even our music taste are the same! I couldn't have asked for a better friend like him.

Back to the topic at hand, at the height of my depression, Alan was the first one I have reached out to talk about it. I was really anxious and scared on what to tell him because this would be my first time opening up to someone. In the end, Alan comforted me on one of my toughest times and said to me that he'll be always avaliable.

,depression,"Growing up, I never witnessed my parents having fun or generally not be depressed for one time, Home was always a sad place to be and it still is. It might sound crazy but it felt like my parents had based their life on their own miserable principle that life has to be hard and sad in order to be right! Like, they preferred to be sad because they had this crazy belief that they could achieve more success by isolating themselves and only focusing on work and absolutely nothing else. I can't remember a single day that they didn't argue or had fun. Even when they did actually tried to have fun there must had been a strong reasoning behind it.

,depression,"For background, I've been depressed for nearly 10-12 years now. I'm writing this because I came across a study with how depression can affect the brain. I don't believe I'm a lost cause although it constantly feels that way because of my habits, lack of motivation and brain.

It feels like a everyday battle with myself and my feelings. I don't feel sad rather disappointed and conflicted of my life- when that fails I feel empty. I am creative, I have always been creative so I constantly come with ideas but I get burnt out so easily. One day I feel so energetic before I fall back into the cycle of sleeping for days, not bothering to do anything. I feel like wasted potential because I know I can do better and I have in later years. Sometimes when I do feel motivated, my mind goes blank and I struggle to remember or physically do anything.

In the study, it showed how depression can cause memory loss, struggles with social abilities and also academic knowledge aswell. I don't believe my depression is at its peak but it's definitely gotten worse mentally, the only difference I can tell is in late years- I was more social and had a strict schedule to follow due to school, events and friends which forced me to get out. In recent years, I don't go out at all or speak to anyone. Normally, I rot away on social media or I'm social in my online presence by playing video games. I don't study anything, after HS I didn't know what do to in college (it's only been a few years after hitting 18). Studying and good grades were pressured on me negatively, causing me to lose any interest in school.

I can tell there's something wrong with my head, my mind feels so blurry like I can't focus. I can't find motivation to do anything, I feel very numb and lost. I can barely spell anymore without auto correct on my phone, same with keeping up with clean handwriting. My memory is like a Goldfish, sometimes I can remember the day before or even what I've done the current day when speaking to my partner. I can feel that I've gotten almost stupider and that my brain is just literally loosing braincells. It's a repeating cycle that i wish to stop, i was so smart before- i could spell most words, i would dedicate myself to art n ideas, i would even get out more. I know and need to make a change so I can get better for my future. At the moment, therapy isn't a option for me and same with medicine but here's what I've added to my daily life.

1. Green tea, it's simple but it's the very start of my routine. It's a ""beginning"" but also has benefits
2. Healthy meals, I stopped buying processed food and instant. I buy minimum items but I try to stick to fresh things like fruit, veggies and nuts. Although i still have trouble finding motivation to get up and cook.
3. Sleeping early, this is hard considering I have Insomnia but I find myself the most productive when I accept that I can't stay up all night- there will always be another day for me to do more.
4. Lists, lists seem to help me alot. I normally list items I need to buy for self-care and budget
5. Walking, as of now- I don't walk due to it feeling like hell outside but it was refreshing to do. Exercise is helpful
6. Showering, finding motivation to shower can be hard when you're laying in bed but I use this as a point to try to start my day and feel more awake.

I'm unsure if these things will 100% help me considering depression has affected me for years now but it's a start, this isn't advice for anyone but if you feel like it can be beneficial to you then go for it.

I&amp;#39;m writing this because I came across a study with how depression can affect the brain. I don&amp;#39;t believe I&amp;#39;m a lost cause although it constantly feels that way because of my habits, lack of motivation and brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels like a everyday battle with myself and my feelings. I don&amp;#39;t feel sad rather disappointed and conflicted of my life- when that fails I feel empty. I am creative, I have always been creative so I constantly come with ideas but I get burnt out so easily. One day I feel so energetic before I fall back into the cycle of sleeping for days, not bothering to do anything. I feel like wasted potential because I know I can do better and I have in later years. Sometimes when I do feel motivated, my mind goes blank and I struggle to remember or physically do anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the study, it showed how depression can cause memory loss, struggles with social abilities and also academic knowledge aswell. I don&amp;#39;t believe my depression is at its peak but it&amp;#39;s definitely gotten worse mentally, the only difference I can tell is in late years- I was more social and had a strict schedule to follow due to school, events and friends which forced me to get out. In recent years, I don&amp;#39;t go out at all or speak to anyone. Normally, I rot away on social media or I&amp;#39;m social in my online presence by playing video games. I don&amp;#39;t study anything, after HS I didn&amp;#39;t know what do to in college (it&amp;#39;s only been a few years after hitting 18). Studying and good grades were pressured on me negatively, causing me to lose any interest in school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can tell there&amp;#39;s something wrong with my head, my mind feels so blurry like I can&amp;#39;t focus. I can&amp;#39;t find motivation to do anything, I feel very numb and lost. I can barely spell anymore without auto correct on my phone, same with keeping up with clean handwriting. My memory is like a Goldfish, sometimes I can remember the day before or even what I&amp;#39;ve done the current day when speaking to my partner. I can feel that I&amp;#39;ve gotten almost stupider and that my brain is just literally loosing braincells. It&amp;#39;s a repeating cycle that i wish to stop, i was so smart before- i could spell most words, i would dedicate myself to art n ideas, i would even get out more. I know and need to make a change so I can get better for my future. At the moment, therapy isn&amp;#39;t a option for me and same with medicine but here&amp;#39;s what I&amp;#39;ve added to my daily life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green tea, it&amp;#39;s simple but it&amp;#39;s the very start of my routine. It&amp;#39;s a &amp;quot;beginning&amp;quot; but also has benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthy meals, I stopped buying processed food and instant. I buy minimum items but I try to stick to fresh things like fruit, veggies and nuts. Although i still have trouble finding motivation to get up and cook.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sleeping early, this is hard considering I have Insomnia but I find myself the most productive when I accept that I can&amp;#39;t stay up all night- there will always be another day for me to do more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lists, lists seem to help me alot. I normally list items I need to buy for self-care and budget&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Walking, as of now- I don&amp;#39;t walk due to it feeling like hell outside but it was refreshing to do. Exercise is helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showering, finding motivation to shower can be hard when you&amp;#39;re laying in bed but I use this as a point to try to start my day and feel more awake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m unsure if these things will 100% help me considering depression has affected me for years now but it&amp;#39;s a start, this isn&amp;#39;t advice for anyone but if you feel like it can be beneficial to you then go for it. After reading the study, i heard practicing things such as quick math, writing and grammar helped people. I also wish to extend my attention span by watching long TV shows or doing tasks for a few hours. I might give a update&lt;/p&gt;

I experienced bullying in school, lacked money, and had no desire to do anything outside of my home. Also, I felt inferior to others. Throughout high school, I never hung out with friends, and my only distractions were video games and music. 

When I entered university, my social anxiety improved, but I still lacked the desire to connect with people or pursue hobbies. I completed my degree and only went out with friends once during that time.

Despite this, I forced myself to engage in normal hobbies, watch movies and series, and participate in sports. I didn't want to appear as the odd one who had no interests or conversation topics. Happiness wasn't a priority; my goal was to have a decent professional career and support my family, I wanted the people next to me to be happy even if I wasnt.

However, fate intervened this year when I met a woman on a dating app who showed genuine interest in me just as I am. We shared everything in common, and our three-month relationship made me feel alive, not just existing. Unfortunately, she ended things and returned to her ex. I feel so empty now.

I know normal people would just get another gf, but I feel every single human is unique, and if wasnt her, Im sure I wouldnt ever have a relationship.

I have no complaints about the people around me or my job. People are generally kind, and I reciprocate that kindness. However, I lack motivation to do anything. I just keep doing what I have to do.

I have no goals, no enjoyment in anything, no hobbies, no desire to travel, or acquire material possessions, or meet other women. I even stopped playing videogames, guitar and piano.

Yet, I can't contemplate ending my life because I want to continue supporting my family. I cant let my family become sad because of my death, and I really fear death myself, so I am afraid I am unable to get used to live a sad life again.

I'm 27 years old, and I've been dealing with depression since 11 I think. I am diagnosed, but the diagnosis came when I was like 20 or so.

Anyways, I decided to make this post because I have a question. I feel like I have a severe case of apathy. I don't care about almost anything except of my family, I have no desires, basically no plans for the future. I'm just existing, like I'm on some kind of limbo.

It feels awful but at the same time it feels like... The thought of going back to being healthy (although I don't remember how that was) sounds false. It sounds like a lie.

,depression,"I don’t post normally but I need a way to get my feelings out other than say Facebook or things such as that. 

Here’s my story…. Grab a seat and a snack and be ready for this. None of it is good. 

I’ve been dealing with mental health all my life. I was 5 when I was diagnosed with bipolar, adhd, autism, anger issues and disgraphia. I’ve been living a shadow of a life ever since. 

My family wanted me to get counseling because of my several attempts of killing myself or saying I would as a kid. I’ve white knuckled my way through life. I’m 23 now and I don’t look like it nor do I act like it. I’m old for someone my age. 

For instance I like jazz and things most people my age don’t. 
Just out of place. 

Depression didn’t really start until I got a little older. It was after high school when I really started to notice that I just don’t care anymore. Living off of impulse and do what I want. Screw everyone else. I’m just so tired of doing that all the time. I’ve been put on medication that almost killed me several times. I’ve had to change psychiatrists several times because of this. 

I know I’m not the only one but I’m definitely one of a few. I’m out of place and out of time. I don’t want to kill myself but I’m not opposed to anything or anyone doing it. I’m just done with everything you know? 

I can’t talk to my family anymore about it. I live in my own and have burned all the bridges in my family. I’ve had what most have not. Help. And I just threw it away because it wasn’t the help that I needed. 

Here is a little context for you. 

When I was 3 my mother and father got divorced. Ever since I’ve been under the same conclusion. It’s my fault. Because I’m different than my entire family. 
My grandfather who was like a father to me, passed away november 22 2018. I graduated 2019. I’ve never felt more defeated in all my life until he was taken from me. I’ve always had a want to help others. After he died, so did I… I’m not ok in the slightest and I know that. But what is stupid is that I’m comfortable in my depression but at the same time I’m tired of it. The main reason I don’t change is because I’m numb. 
It’s not a matter of not wanting to, it’s a matter of feeling worthless and unwanted but at the same time loved and wanted. These are mixed signals as clear as the sky is blue. 
This has been an issue since I was little. 

I’m different and I don’t trust anyone anymore. I’m just fed up of trying. 

I’m also flirtatious by nature. I try not to be but my mouth gets me into trouble. I tell my self one thing and do the opposite. I’ve lost several jobs this way. I want to go mute because of this. 

I’ve host lost all hope by this point that I can change and that I should even try. Maybe this is my fate to be the super villain of my story. I don’t know. I just don’t know… I’m not even tired anymore. I just don’t care and don’t want to do anything. I’ve just lost my will and want to live because what’s the point. My family and friends all tell me I have this great potential but I’ve never seen it myself. I won’t kill my self but if someone else does it, by all means go for it. I know my family and friends love me but I don’t love myself. I’ve hated myself since the day I learned the word.

&lt;p&gt;Here’s my story…. Grab a seat and a snack and be ready for this. None of it is good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been dealing with mental health all my life. I was 5 when I was diagnosed with bipolar, adhd, autism, anger issues and disgraphia. I’ve been living a shadow of a life ever since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family wanted me to get counseling because of my several attempts of killing myself or saying I would as a kid. I’ve white knuckled my way through life. I’m 23 now and I don’t look like it nor do I act like it. I’m old for someone my age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance I like jazz and things most people my age don’t. 
Just out of place. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression didn’t really start until I got a little older. It was after high school when I really started to notice that I just don’t care anymore. Living off of impulse and do what I want. Screw everyone else. I’m just so tired of doing that all the time. I’ve been put on medication that almost killed me several times. I’ve had to change psychiatrists several times because of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I’m not the only one but I’m definitely one of a few. I’m out of place and out of time. I don’t want to kill myself but I’m not opposed to anything or anyone doing it. I’m just done with everything you know? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t talk to my family anymore about it. I live in my own and have burned all the bridges in my family. I’ve had what most have not. Help. And I just threw it away because it wasn’t the help that I needed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a little context for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was 3 my mother and father got divorced. Ever since I’ve been under the same conclusion. It’s my fault. Because I’m different than my entire family. 
My grandfather who was like a father to me, passed away november 22 2018. I graduated 2019. I’ve never felt more defeated in all my life until he was taken from me. I’ve always had a want to help others. After he died, so did I… I’m not ok in the slightest and I know that. But what is stupid is that I’m comfortable in my depression but at the same time I’m tired of it. The main reason I don’t change is because I’m numb. 
It’s not a matter of not wanting to, it’s a matter of feeling worthless and unwanted but at the same time loved and wanted. These are mixed signals as clear as the sky is blue. 
This has been an issue since I was little. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m different and I don’t trust anyone anymore. I’m just fed up of trying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m also flirtatious by nature. I try not to be but my mouth gets me into trouble. I tell my self one thing and do the opposite. I’ve lost several jobs this way. I want to go mute because of this. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve host lost all hope by this point that I can change and that I should even try. Maybe this is my fate to be the super villain of my story. I don’t know. I just don’t know… I’m not even tired anymore. I just don’t care and don’t want to do anything. I’ve just lost my will and want to live because what’s the point. My family and friends all tell me I have this great potential but I’ve never seen it myself. I won’t kill my self but if someone else does it, by all means go for it. I know my family and friends love me but I don’t love myself. I’ve hated myself since the day I learned the word. &lt;/p&gt;

A cette période je me sentais déjà très seul. J’avais certes des potes mais très peu que je considérais comme grand ami. Au côté de ce groupe de pote je me sentais seul en étant accompagné et même si ça va un peu mieux aujourd’hui je ne me suis pas vraiment fait d’autres potes depuis. Il y avait beaucoup de moments où je parlais sans être écouté/entendu malgré mes efforts. Pour d’autres raisons également j’avais décidé de concentrer toute mon attention envers ma copine de l’époque qui a fini par me quitter il y a 1 an. J’ai donc ressenti l’impression d’avoir perdu à la fois ma copine, ma meilleure amie et tout mon entourage non familial. Cette année fut témoin d’une énorme remise en question et réflexion sur moi même. Je ne me suis jamais senti seul et triste de toute ma vie.

C’est d’ailleurs la seule raison concrète qui me déchire et me fait pleurer de temps à autre. Récemment j’ai vécu un peu + d’1 mois en étant dans un vrai mood Good vibe mais je sens clairement une rechute depuis plusieurs jours.

She took her ring off.  We had some stressors in our relationship. She wouldn't talk to me about it, and instead, gave me the silent treatment.  I talked to one of my friends about it because I needed an ear and advice.  I needed some comfort and to figure out how to fix things.    This angered my fiancee.  She didn't appreciate me airing our dirty laundry to someone else, which is a fair complaint.   I should have kept my feelings to myself.  Anyway, it appears I have failed at yet another relationship because she requested I keep my distance from her, and I have.  I've mostly isolated myself in one of our bedrooms, only emerging to walk the dog or go to work.  I have not engaged in conversation or even initiated any text messages.  The last time we had an actual conversation she told me she feels I don't listen to her.  I waited until she was done talking and summarized what she said.  I even asked if my summary was correct. She said it was.  Later on she texted me saying she is taking her ring off because she is unsure about the relationship.  I really thought I had gotten things right this time.  The biggest problem is that there's a child involved, and I love him too.  I have been a step mom to him for nearly 2 years. The thought of losing both of them is devastating.  I get it, though.  I'm just not good enough of a person to deserve love. It feels like I'm unworthy. I feel despondent.

How is this hell gonna make me better off? I&amp;#39;m gonna be entering the work force around 30 and no one is going to give me a chance. All i feel like doing is going and standing in traffic. There&amp;#39;s no point to anything anymore&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I(34F) have come to the realization over the last 6 months or so that I may be ""depressed"", incapable of feeling genuine happiness or excitement. Absolutely nothing triggers any dopamine or any sense of joy. None of the things that I used to look forward to or jump out of bed about gives me the same feeling or any feeling at all anymore.
I've gone through a lot in the last year, and life has a funny sense of humor at my expense it seems. 
For example, I was finally ""excited"" for my birthday this year, and the morning of I woke up at 8am with a migraine so bad..I was in bed until 4 pm canceling the plans my boyfriend made.  Then I went out to meet my best friend once I was well enough (plans he made a week prior), and he never showed, ending a 14 year long friendship.

Another example.. going on a trip I've been looking forward to for months and spent loads on..only to get my period (off schedule) the day we arrive and be in so much pain and unable to do many activities for days .

Meeting friends for a concert we've all been looking forward to..only to have them no show. That's happened twice this year, different friends.

I could go on and on and on with similar examples..

I've lost so many friendships this year because I no longer tolerated the one sidedness of it. If I don't reach out.. they are gone. 

My workplace brings me down more than anything, and ive tried out other jobs but they just don't pay as well. So right now I'm not working much.
I just don't know how to cope. 
I feel numb and no longer capable of achieving anything above a 5/10 on the mood scale. My boyfriend and I have a wonderful relationship, but i know this weighs on him because he is such an excitable person.
Does anyone have any sort of advice? 
I'd like to do therapy, but I have no insurance at my job and it's not in my budget.

,depression,"I've been living with my ex gf for 5 years. It's been a really long time and she was my first ever gf. We broke up roughly a year and a half ago but we have still been living together with her two cats (who we got as kittens 5 years ago). We've had our ups and downs and argue sometimes, but we also laugh together and I do enjoy talking to her.

A few weeks ago, she suddenly told me that she will be moving to her own place. I understand why she wants to, but it just came as a shock to me. My little brother is in a bad situation at the moment, and he comes here every week to stay with us. He looked extremely sad and worried when I told him that I'll have to leave, and this made me more upset.

To make matters worse, she's taking the cats (who I have bonded with and lived with since they were kittens). She's leaving today and I'm really dreading it and feel extremely upset about it. I'll move to my grandmother's house in a few weeks, and I'm REALLY not looking forward to that but I have no other option.

Another thing is that I have had a new serious relationship for roughly a year, but she also hasn't been able to live with me. And to make things even worse....it seems like she will break up with me soon. It kind of feels like I'm losing two people at once (along with my cats) and also won't be able to hang out with my little brother regularly anymore.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I might finally be able to realize my dream and live overseas in 6 months. Not having to pay rent anymore by living at my grandmother's house will enable me to save up and finally go. That makes me really nervous but I'm also excited as it is my dream.

I'm usually a happy-go-lucky person and rarely get sad, but this is the first time in my life that I feel genuinely depressed and really upset. Not sure how to handle it and would really appreciate some advice.

,depression,"Heh, 21 years constantly fighting on a warpath. Achieving success after success, building myself up and investing in myself. Only for all of it to be stripped away. Once a genetically modified freak of nature, only to end up as mere flesh and bones. No medical objective reason. Alone with my thoughts, voluntarily. Albeit I can’t even hear them anymore. 

Every single day, helping countless people. Life deserves to be a place of serenity and tranquility for everyone.

Or so I thought.

I have reached to a point where: I no longer formulate thoughts in my head. Constant autopilot mode, pure instinct. These decades of reading, absorbing knowledge, working tirelessly for validation only to become a laughing stock. Focus? Concentration? Achieving tasks? Used to mean something to me, it’s not that I don’t have the energy to talk. It’s just I literally don’t come up with anything of use. Thoughts that used to take me milliseconds to form now take minutes. It’s painful watching this fall from grace yet live it as well. 

Emptiness, hollowness. Numb. 
These 3 words pretty much sum up my situation. 

I honestly still don’t know the reason I get out of bed. I’ve seen my family and friends reach out and try their utmost best to help me. Can’t pour out of an empty cup sadly. It takes me an insurmountable amount of effort to even utter words. 

I am too much of a coward to proceed with my life, or do anything really. So this raises the question, “Why Live?” I am also too much of a coward to take my own life.

Crossroads, I have now decided to fully confine myself in my room. Spend the rest of my days staring into the abyss, 0 activity. Just pondering the walls of my room. Only then will I feel true inner peace having obliterated my life rather than face public humiliation. I don’t get to hear it anymore. 

Ambition? Drive? Passion? Aspirations? Goals? Nah. I’ll pass. I tried and I have nothing left to give anymore. 

I am about to go to a therapist (forced by my father) tomorrow. I grew up in a community where mental health is severely stigmatized due to heavy religious influence so I wonder what her reactions going to be when I showcase this adamant desire. Truly is pathetic. 




For the first time in my life, I’ve went from a social bubbly person to embracing 4 months of self-inflicted self-sabotage. All sense of self-identity, self-worth, self esteem has virtually dissipated. Can’t even follow along plots of shows anymore. Don’t remember anything. Purely living in the moment. The bliss of being alone! 

Should I document this journey Im about to embark? I’m 100% serious that I will genuinely live the rest of my days locked in my room with no socialization or any form of contact. Atleast that way people can examine and I can atleast have my legacy be that as an experiment. I’m willing to purchase a camera and send the footage to anyone who wants it, sort of like a vlog lmao.

&lt;p&gt;Ambition? Drive? Passion? Aspirations? Goals? Nah. I’ll pass. I tried and I have nothing left to give anymore. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am about to go to a therapist (forced by my father) tomorrow. I grew up in a community where mental health is severely stigmatized due to heavy religious influence so I wonder what her reactions going to be when I showcase this adamant desire. Truly is pathetic. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the first time in my life, I’ve went from a social bubbly person to embracing 4 months of self-inflicted self-sabotage. All sense of self-identity, self-worth, self esteem has virtually dissipated. Can’t even follow along plots of shows anymore. Don’t remember anything. Purely living in the moment. The bliss of being alone! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should I document this journey Im about to embark? I’m 100% serious that I will genuinely live the rest of my days locked in my room with no socialization or any form of contact. Atleast that way people can examine and I can atleast have my legacy be that as an experiment. I’m willing to purchase a camera and send the footage to anyone who wants it, sort of like a vlog lmao. Eh idk spitballing ig. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lmk! &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've always felt a feeling of depression within myself growing up. Id say I am a happy personality with a sad soul. I never considered it to be depression because I did not have terrible thoughts about myself or feelings of worthlessness until 2020. It slowly increased and In 2021 I experienced a very dark depression and finally understand the true meaning of it. You truly cannot grasp how it feels until you've experience the pain and the thoughts. It's like no matter what you have, do or know, the thoughts and feelings do not falter. I tried so many coping mechanisms to make life better but could not get my mind to heal. I knew I had a desirable life on the outside looking in, and still felt such worthlessness, self hate and did not want to continue living. I contemplated and planned suicide a lot. I'd cry every single day and drown in the misery of waking up again and having to go through more life. It felt as though anything I try to do to make life better, it made it worse. It is such an internal battle. I finally started taking antidepressant during that time period because I started to actively seek out ways to commit suicide and get the means to do so. It healed my mind so much. I finally felt happy again, id speak to my mom and just tell her how happy I feel everyday. I stopped after a while and still felt some depressive symptoms but not as deep and harrowing. I also have ADHD. I changed a lot of aspects of my life and did a lot of reflection and introspection and I do feel better generally in life. I think back at this time and it feels like such a traumatic life event. Just having my brain be so dark. Its an unforgettable feeling and time of my life that changed me so much.

With that being said this past year in 2023 I broke up with a boyfriend of 8 years who cheated and then got into a very traumatic, abusive relationship with a narcissist. A canon event I'd say. The abuse, betrayal and evil I experienced from someone I loved was so extreme and confusing. It left me with no job or home because I had to escape from him and run to a different state for my safety. Ive been struggling to heal from this and find work as well. Reflecting on all of this and the current state of my life leaves me very sad. Rebuilding my self worth as well as being completely alone every day is very saddening after having back to back very codependent relationships. I am very unproductive and sit home every day with barely any social interactions. I know I need hobbies and activities but its hard to find motivation... With that being said I do not feel that depressed. I'm sad often but I would not say I feel those deep depressive feelings that I once struggled so deeply with. I can still find some happiness in my day to day. Before, any inconvenience would send me off the deep end but even with all of this new trauma, I do not feel that way. I don't feel depressed but I often feel like ending my life because the struggle of life, the economy and loneliness is just so unbearable and unenjoyable. No plans or real desire but it's a reocurring thought.

It almost seems like once you feel deep depression and suicidal thoughts, they will always return. Depression kind of feels like a cycle or even like an addiction. Not that you desire it but in a way that you go into periods of remission or sobriety and then those thoughts creep up and you bask in your dark feelings. Its like you try not to relapse and when you feel yourself slipping you have to fight, and it scares you. Or even like a spectrum that you constantly teeter on. Its almost like you can never get rid of the darkness inside of you. Sometimes I think I enjoy feeling deep emotion, whether good or bad.

I have put this off for far to long after being told by a friend I should ask for help here. Let's start with why I need help. This is a lot so bare with me please. I feel I need to tell the whole story so everyone that is going to help knows exactly what happened even if it means putting all my personal information out there. The main thing I am worried about is my oldest son. He has been struggling with adhd and depression since he started school. He is on medication and sees doctors twice a month for it. To say the least I'm his strong backbone that helps him when he has his bad days. I was forced to leave him and ever since he had really been struggling. I'm asking for help to fix my car (650) and get gas money (350)to get back to be in the same state with him and as well as my other kids but he needs me the most especially now. He is turning 10 on July 18th. I want to be back there for him and with him as soon as possible. I can't describe how much stress this has caused me mentally and physically. I been working at a dead end job to just try and stay afloat and get my car fixed which just stopped working so I can get back to him. I'm really ashamed to ask for help as a grown man. But it isn't about me anymore. I need to get back to him and I can't do it on my own.I NEED HELP. PLEASE.


Here is a back story to what happened to get me in this situation. At the end of last year 2023 around November I lose my home that I worked to keep for two years. ( A lil back story. I'm not trying to bash anyone or place all blame on anyone because I'm at somewhat fault as well for not seeing the signs. I was blinded by what I thought was love. It all started on Christmas Eve 2021 when my life began to change. My and my girlfriend of a year at the time were in a a really bad car accident. She was injured pretty bad. So I took on the mantle of providing for our family. This turned out to be a crucial decision. I spent the next two years busting my tail to provide for her and her daughter as well as my own three kids I have. It was working out pretty good for a year or more or so. I was able to maintain our home and both our cars. It started to get overwhelming after such a lengthy period of time. In this time I exhausted all my avenues of trying to stay afloat and allowing her to heal properly by staying at home and me taking all responsibilities for everything. I maxed out all my credit cards and was working two jobs day and night to try to be the man and keep everything that I had gotten for us.

Things took a turn for the worst. Instead of helping me she shut down. Then month by month we ended up getting lights turned off. Next month water turned off. It was just a domino affect. One thing lead to another. Robbing Peter to pay Paul as they say. Finally it came to a head and we were kicked out of our home because turns out she was not paying the bills like I thought she was. Which is why I take blame I put all that on her to pay the bills (as in call in and make sure they were paid since I was working to make the money for them. All while she was not doing that. She was depressed coming to find out because of how she felt after the accident. So instead of paying the bills she used lots of the money for self care which turned out to be cheating as well. So we are kicked out and all of our things put on the curb. I was then forced to move states away from my kids with family because I had no where else to go. I'm am cracking under the pressure mentally and physically to be quite honest. Seeing my son struggle ever since I had to leave is heart breaking. I'm only asking for help to fix my car and gas to get back there. I already have a friend that is going to allow me to stay with them until I get back on my feet so I can be closer to my kids. I have secured a job for when I get back there so I'm not asking for handouts and not doing anything positive to help myself. I just need a little help to get ahead.


Anthing would help whether it's a dollar or two or if your feeling more generous. I just want to get back to my son where I belong and where he needs me. I thank everyone in advance for taking the time to read my story and possibly helping. Thank you may God bless us all.

It&amp;#39;s hard for me to ask for help as a adult man. But I&amp;#39;m in need of help immediately. I have put this off for far to long after being told by a friend I should ask for help here. Let&amp;#39;s start with why I need help. This is a lot so bare with me please. I feel I need to tell the whole story so everyone that is going to help knows exactly what happened even if it means putting all my personal information out there. The main thing I am worried about is my oldest son. He has been struggling with adhd and depression since he started school. He is on medication and sees doctors twice a month for it. To say the least I&amp;#39;m his strong backbone that helps him when he has his bad days. I was forced to leave him and ever since he had really been struggling. I&amp;#39;m asking for help to fix my car (650) and get gas money (350)to get back to be in the same state with him and as well as my other kids but he needs me the most especially now. He is turning 10 on July 18th. I want to be back there for him and with him as soon as possible. I can&amp;#39;t describe how much stress this has caused me mentally and physically. I been working at a dead end job to just try and stay afloat and get my car fixed which just stopped working so I can get back to him. I&amp;#39;m really ashamed to ask for help as a grown man. But it isn&amp;#39;t about me anymore. I need to get back to him and I can&amp;#39;t do it on my own.I NEED HELP. PLEASE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a back story to what happened to get me in this situation. At the end of last year 2023 around November I lose my home that I worked to keep for two years. ( A lil back story. I&amp;#39;m not trying to bash anyone or place all blame on anyone because I&amp;#39;m at somewhat fault as well for not seeing the signs. I was blinded by what I thought was love. It all started on Christmas Eve 2021 when my life began to change. My and my girlfriend of a year at the time were in a a really bad car accident. She was injured pretty bad. So I took on the mantle of providing for our family. This turned out to be a crucial decision. I spent the next two years busting my tail to provide for her and her daughter as well as my own three kids I have. It was working out pretty good for a year or more or so. I was able to maintain our home and both our cars. It started to get overwhelming after such a lengthy period of time. In this time I exhausted all my avenues of trying to stay afloat and allowing her to heal properly by staying at home and me taking all responsibilities for everything. I maxed out all my credit cards and was working two jobs day and night to try to be the man and keep everything that I had gotten for us. I finally after so long pressured her to start looking for a job I could no longer do it alone. Which gets to where the main problems started to happen. I didn&amp;#39;t realize how much pressure I was putting on her because I was stressed out and maxed out. Well this pressure actually made things worst because now things she didn&amp;#39;t say before came to light. Which was she was depressed on how the car accident made her look and feel and she shut down. So for the next half of year or so when I begged for help and pleaded I couldn&amp;#39;t do it anymore.

I’m not starving and I have family that cares enough to let me at least stay with them again (though I’m afraid of my mental health tanking with them). I’ve had bad mental health issues since I was 12 years old, that was my first time attempting to harm myself and feeling like dying. I had bad internalized homophobia over liking women and I had to get over that recently. I ended up dating a guy during covid in college summer of 2020. I don’t want to say he was completely abusive. I was horrible and toxic in my own way due to my own traumas, and there are things I should’ve never done, like be overly jealous and threw things he bought me away out of spite, or dropping his toothbrush on the bathroom floor rug after an argument, which I immensely regret because it turns out it could’ve caused bad illness, as well as having a meltdown in front of him which caused him to freak out. But the sexual stuff really fucked me up and how I see my body. I learned after telling people I was definitely raped…and gaslit into thinking I wasn’t. I even feel weird saying that because it doesn’t feel real. I thought I was making it up as an excuse to act mentally ill. He did things that I didn’t consent to on more than one occasion. And shamed me into feeling like crap for asking him to…ask. I explicitly said no when trying to do my homework. I pretended to be ok with the sudden fingering. Then I said no sex tho. Then he just kinda did it. And I pretended to be ok with it. Afterwards I just cried in the shower and kept thinking about it when I was trying to do my homework. It wasn’t just that. I realized he would constantly sexualize me. He didn’t really give a fuck about my hobbies or interests or playing cool games together. The worst time was when I was trying to show off a lego set I got for christmas, after my dad was arrested for a dui (I was supposed to talk to him about his alchoholism but didn’t wanna ruin christmas so I felt like it was my fault). He said he didn’t give a fuck and asked me to flash my tits, which I did hesitantly. I took nudes of myself for him and he threatened to break up two days after that. I was basically personal jerkoff material and felt sexually humiliated. I was also pressured into sex in my own car in the beginning of our relationship. I never really got support from my mom after telling her. I guess she just wanted me to not let it affect my academic performance.

And ontop of this I&amp;#39;ve been making massive mistakes, and hurting people i really care about. I hate even to be angry or upset with people, let alone actually inflict any emotional or physical harm.&lt;br/&gt;
Im pushing everyone away cause I dont want to hurt them, and Im afraid to talk to people cause I feel so two faced if im just behaving in ways that make me likable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, I know it sounds stupid to be hung up on things like that because life happens, and every person wants to be liked (as I have been told numerous times). But i just cant let it go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A friend suggested I might have a type of OCD called Moral Scrupulosity, and it fits really well with how ive been feeling for the past year, but I dont want to self diagnose or claim anything cause I could be far off.

,depression,"I live in a constant state of dissatisfaction, regret, envy, and self-loathing. 
 
People think I’m exaggerating when I say this but there is truly nothing I like about myself. I don’t like how I look. I don’t like how I sound. I don’t like how my mind works.

I hate how pathetic I am, how stupid I am. I’ve become everything I look down on. I have no accomplishments. No medals. Sure life isn’t about medals but they are to me. To be praised, to be envied, to be held in high regard. I envy my athletic classmates all the time. It’s too late for me to be a prodigy. I’m not good at anything. Anything I’m remotely decent doing is clouded by the fact that it will never give me what I want and I would trade it any day for something else. 

I want nothing out of life. I hate nature. I hate the rain. Hate the sun. I hate when people think that I should care about losing these things. There’s nothing I like that isn’t tied to being a consumer. I am materialistic at heart and I don’t plan on changing my ways. I consume what I can afford and dream about consuming things that are expensive. But even that will never fill the hole I feel where there should be a zest for living.

I don’t care. I can only see life going down from here (shitty college and generally not motivation to get out of bed). Yeah yeah life isn’t about where you go or whatever. We all hear it. But for someone like me, these things are important. I believe people are measured by their achievements and success. I believe that life is linear. You do this, you do that, and you do it well. 

Everywhere I look, I’m dissatisfied with how things work and look down on everything including myself. I hate and look down on this country. I look down on my school. I look down on my family and friends. I look down on the bad things happening in the world.

Sure, some might venture to say that it’s this dissatisfaction with the world that makes it my calling to change it or fucking something. But there is nothing and no one I look down on more than myself. It’s not just my circumstances I despise, it’s me. I am disgusted with myself. 

The answer is simple right? Just change then. Some would say. But I can’t change. I don’t want to. I will remain in this cycle. Because it’s not my actions I hate (though it’s also a part of it). It’s my person. I hate the person I am at my very core. I hate how I squirm when my wrongdoings are held in front of me like a child caught in a lie, with my mouth open like a fish. I hate how people see right through me. I hate how I pretend to be smarter than I really am but if you really quiz me, I know nothing. I don’t have the answers. I’m not interesting. 

The only things I don’t hate and I think are worth looking at are the things that make me envious. And when I envy, my stomach is twisted into a knot and I feel nauseous. I’m constantly jealous. But I don’t plan on removing the things that make me jealous because I deserve to feel jealous. It’s torture seeing the people have what I want, do what I want to do, receive worldwide recognition, being beautiful. Say what you want about taking a break from social media but you don’t understand how much I need to see it. It makes me despise myself even more than I really did. I keep a compilation of these things and dedicate a self-inflicted, mental torture session sometimes. 

Everywhere I look, I see no reason to give it my time of day. I see no reason to live. I hate everything. It seems childish but at its core, I hate everything. Everyday, I wake up cursing because I have to go through this again. The dissatisfaction. The envy. 

I want to die and I’m tired. I know I’m the problem. But I don’t care.

Is he going to recreate what he saw? Am I a bad influence on him?

I was writing her a novel.

She was the only person in the world that could snap me out of depression. At this point not even love could. She knew I was living with my lone grandmother. One day she had a stroke and I had to leave town. I was so sad I may never get to see my prof again. But I held on the hope that she would get better.

It turned out true her mother died and she was all alone. I promised to always visit. 

I got severe depression because i couldn't handle seeing the my hero this broken. I decided to be her hero and make her happy.

I visited several time with gifts, agreed I would help her with researches. I visited once and then she told me to come again the following day even calling me son.

I went and a friend of hers (that doesnt know me) humiliated me for being unemployed and made fun of everything even saying that she would report me for harassment if I ever came again. All this while my prof played dumb or joked at my expense.

She knew how much she meant to me and still did that. I started flipping out knowing that she will have to cut me off to preserve her image being a single woman and all.

And it was true she now wouldn't even talk to me in the street or would very aggressive leaving while I am talking.


This has made me spiral into a lot of sexual or that I am into older women and violent thoughts, therapy didn't help and nothing is getting better it has been a year.

&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;#39;t know what to do anymore.  it&amp;#39;s not like i can control whatever my mind thinks, what my mind does to me, &amp;amp; what my mind manifests in my body.  i just want to kill myself so she wouldn&amp;#39;t have to care for me anymore.  i love my mom, she&amp;#39;s the best person i&amp;#39;ve ever known and maybe me committing suicide would be the best option for me and her.&lt;/p&gt;

 I live with my step mother and step father in the literal middle of nowhere (my bio mom died in childbirth and then my bio dad remarried to my step mother and they both got custody of me, but then my dad died and my step mother got to keep custody and she remarried fairly recently) and I've been struggling with unemployment and housing crises due to serious health issues that have been ruining my life for five years.

I applied for disability (with my health issues, its a guarantee I'll get approved) in order to help with the unemployment, but it's taking forever to get back. I've been jobless for two years and my unemployment finally ran out this month.I have no car and the nearest town to get a job is 74 minutes away. I literally have no idea how I'm going to feed me or my cat for the next two weeks. 

I don't know how I'm doing anything or even operating at this point, to be honest. It's a lot worse than I'm going to reveal on Reddit to strangers, because, even though this is a throw away account, I feel so much shame in my current situation.

I don't know how much longer I can stay living with my step parents, because my step father makes all these sexual comments about my body and has even laid his hands on me on a couple of occasions, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I spend all day in my bedroom now and rarely leave except at night. At night I sneak down the hall to the kitchen and eat whatever little food I have left. I tried talking about it to my aunt (step mother's sister) about it, but she tried to sway me against it and she's the only other family member I have in contact with.

I have no friends here. I have no real support system. I'm just day in day out living with the chronic dread that I

1) am disabled

2) don't have a job/can't have a job

3) have to deal with my disgusting step father, and 

4) am cooped up in a bedroom all day in fear, because I don't want to even see my step father.

,depression,"Hi all,

I have been struggling with Depression and likely Anxiety for 20+ years, but in the past 10 it has gotten worse. There was a point where I was relapsing into deep depression 4 to 5 times a year that took a month or more to recover from. I was doing a little better, but now I am dealing with something I am not sure how to handle.

It first happened a few months ago on a work trip. I had just finished up for the day and was looking forward to getting back to my room to relax and watch a movie. I got into my room and sat on the side of the bed, and then it started. The best way I can describe it was a heat starting in my feet and slowly rising, as it moved up my body I could feel all of the concerns I usually struggle with during depression creep its way back in to my mind. I couldn't control it and that scared me which of course made things worse. It took a week for me to get back to myself. 

I am struggling through the fallout of the the same thing now. I again was just relaxing and it started to come over me in the same way. I am someone who does a lot of research when I struggle with things, and I think these might be panic attacks? 

The thing that scares me is that I can not seem to stop them. I try breathing exercises, meditation, exercise, but I can't stop it. I am on meds for depression, Sertraline and buspirone, but I am at a loss for how to control this or at least prevent it. Any ideas or help?

I have been dealing with heavy depression for 10 years, started meds last year and they are kinda helping. I left a 3 year relationship a few months ago because I kept falling in and out of depressive episodes leading to the decline of the relationship. During the end also realized I felt trapped with her. I loved her more than any person but being constrained was creating more unhappy feelings than she was creating happy ones. The irony felt cruel. I always love a good excuse to self destruct, so I did and I left her right after. 

Now I'm with someone else. She's poly, and I guess I am now too. I tried so hard to be friends with my ex but she found out I rebounded and now she told me she never wants to speak to me again.

,depression,"I'm 23M. Long story short, I had a best friend when I was in early childhood and honestly that was the best part of my life. But then he moved away and although I had some friends after, none really ever came close to him. I just felt so loved and special around him, but he moved away so soon.

I experienced some neglect too. There were times in my life where the only peers my age I got to see were like once a week on Sundays for 3 hours at most. It really sucked. Apparently I hung out with my neighbors multiple days a week for years for most of elementary according to my mom, but I don't remember. I trust my mom but maybe she doesn't remember? Idk. I'm worried I only saw them once a week at most. Is that normal? I guess she probably remembers just fine.

I wish I could've gone to sports. I wish I could've seen other kids my age every day like the public schoolers got to do. I wish we had more money to do fun stuff with my friends. I wish I got to have a big birthday party with my best friend and a bunch of other people. I wish I could've gone to prom. I wish I could've had a sleepover (with close friends that actually liked me). I wish I could've seen my friends every day in summer and did summer stuff, even if it was just one friend.

I was such a lonely child. This probably sounds pathetic but in middle school I used to pretend I had a little brother and he'd sit with me in the car and talk and we'd cuddle.

Why do I always have to be alone? Why do the people closest to me always have to go? I don't mind having responsibilities or do adult things but all my friends wanna get married, but I'm not ready to move to that stage of life.

I just want to be as close to someone like a little brother like I could've been in childhood.

I don't hate my life. I love my life. I never asked for a perfect life I just asked for someone special to be with.

Is it too late for me? Can I still have a close best friend that I can see every day? I just want a best friend like I used to have, and have them be in my life for longer than a short period of time. I just want to feel that close to someone again. It'd even be nice to have a close group of friends. I never asked for a perfect life, just one where I had someone special.

I'm scared that even if I did get a best friend, that it just wouldn't be the same as it would've been back then. That they'll act too ""old"" and ""mature"", and that there won't be as much fun stuff to do because no one really cares about young adults as much.

I can be angry at the world and nobody else can feel that same anger and for once I feel like a complete individual. For once I don&amp;#39;t have to share something. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know. Maybe I need some sort of ego death. It&amp;#39;s strangely cathartic though. My pain is mine and nobody else can have it and something about that feels good, even if it always ends up hurting me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be part of the depression, right? I don&amp;#39;t know if anyone else feels this way, though. &lt;/p&gt;

My mom recently found out that my father has been seeing another woman, I already knew this a long time ago but I didn’t know what to do I was afraid to tell my mother because I know it would hurt her and I was still young at that time. My father has been a responsible father, he provided us food, a great house, he spoilt us with many gifts and gives us decent amount of money, but I think it’s really painful for my mother because she was trying to do her best to become a good wife, she provided him love and support but he just ignores it. I’m gonna leave for college because I’ll be studying at another region about 1000km, I am really excited to leave because I felt that staying in our house was really intoxicating, my mom would always compare me to my older sister, she would always remind me that I am different than my classmates, (I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder) she keeps telling me that I should really be organized and responsible which made me felt incapable of doing and achieving higher dreams since I am being constantly reminded that I can’t do it cause I’m different, she also has her favors on my sister, she always prioritize my sister and praise how good she is and that I should be like her, I tried to be like her once, I remember during my 8th grade I really worked hard to achieve with high honors because I always saw them really proud at my sister, my father even wears his uniform on the stage(he’s a police officer) but at the time of my recognition, nobody came, so I told my teacher I wasn’t feeling well and left, even at my high school graduation I felt really bad cause I asked them to come for my graduation it was only about 4 hours but my father left early and my mother was in a hurry, she keeps calling me that we should go home but I told her if she could wait for a moment cause I was still taking pictures with my classmates whom I would be leaving cause I’ll be studying in another region but she left anyways. I really envied how the other parents hold their children with pride in their eyes.

It really hurts me how they give so much importance at my sister but I guess she deserves it cause she’s smart, brave and confident and I think it’s because she was born first, my mother would always tell me that I should respect and prioritize her, I remember we transferred to our new house, me and my sister picked the same room but it was given to her cause she was the eldest and naturally eldest gets whats the best, my sister was leaving to study at another region in a few months but I didn’t argue cause younger siblings should always submit and respect their parents and older sibling/s. I didn’t hate them for that though, I was still grateful that I have a roof under my head, I have food at the table and I was able to study. Now that I’m in college I’m ready to leave and chase my dreams but I worry about my mother what if she and my father would fight, she would be all alone and I can’t let that happen, I know how it feels to be alone, to succumb in a dark place where everthing feels useless and pointless to the extent that you just want to end it all.

But I'd be frozen in place, my mind would be in chaos. I'd hear my parents or the TV outside, life going on as normal around me, and the ball would start expanding. I felt like it was trying to burst out of me. And I had to ""eat"" it to keep it under control; I had to keep taking huge gulps of air because that's what would make the ball smaller. And I never got it to disappear; I think I just fell asleep from exhaustion. I don't remember thinking anything, just trying to make the ball stop growing.

The same notion that if I don't have it under control, something really bad will happen. To think about it, it ends the same way as well; eventually giving in to exhaustion with my mind still fried.

Life just fucking sucks. I mean seriously, it sucks. I know life is unfair and it doesn’t give a shit what happens but seriously; it’s just so fucked. i have no friends and i have nobody to talk to i have a pile load of problems which are seriously fucking my life up even more for the worse and quite frankly i don’t have the energy to do anything at all, even though i desire to do a lot (my adhd is behind this shit)i still sit at home doing nothing feeling completely alone or just “out of it” as i like to call it. Gambling and cutting to numb my feelings just kinda messed my life up more and more and these issues obviously had a domino effect on my entire life, i’ve missed out on literally so many experiences because my life for the past 3 years has been completely fucked. I’m so angry and upset at myself and the world in general, but then i just come back to this gut renching empty feeling. Sometimes i contemplate killing myself but i know i would never because i also do want to live, very badly i want to live, just not like this. i’m not diagnosed with anything other than ADHD, but im sure i have a full load of stuff going on in my mind because for as long as i remember ive felt empty and shit.
