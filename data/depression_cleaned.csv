"Recently after joining this sub, I’ve realized that i have a functional depression. I still need meds and help and so on, but i can relatively function normally. Most people i know dont know about my depression. My question is why is it that way? Some people can barley get out of bed (which is me sometimes) while others continue to go on with their lives. Idc if this is dumb but im curious",0
Most people who fail in school have a good social life. And most people who fail to have a social life do well in school. Most people succeed in both.  I somehow managed to fail in both and now i’m a complete fucking loser,0
Life is meaningless and I don’t want to do it anymore. ,0
"hey guys, f 25 here. when will life ever get better? i’m so tired of waiting. everyday is a bad day. i’ve struggled with depression since probably around 21. i have a good car, not broke, have a house but yet so broken inside. i feel like an ungrateful brat, who appreciates no one, or anything i have. i also had an abortion in January, wrecked me more so. i just can’t. i just wanna be happy. i don’t know how much longer i can go ❤️‍🩹",0
"There’s nothing to look forward to, the only time I ever feel calm is when I lay down and imagine I was dead. I destroy everyone around me. And I truly think I was supposed to die in 2010 when I almost did. Every moment of my life has been agony and I’m 32. Chronically ill &amp; getting worse. The people who stopped me before don’t exist in my life now or are better off without me. I deactivated all my accounts. I wanted to sell all my stuff before but I don’t even have the energy for that. Idk why I’mPosting here - maybe for encouragement as I’m a terrible coward and haven’t ever been able to do it ",0
"I can’t even eat. Very close to loosing my job. Meds and therapy don’t work. Live alone and no one would even know if I died. Kept functional for years for my son. Now that he is all grown up and busy in his life, I have no reason to live or do anything. Yes I would love to be around just in case my son would need me… but now it’s so very hard. Every minute is misery.. you don’t need to die to go to hell. I’m in it.",0
"Just have this horrible feeling like I would be loved more if I was not alive. Like I would be appreciated more and thought of positive and more often if I just went out with a ""bang"".Sucks",0
"I’m 20 I have no social life and live a really terrible, lonełyl life. I detest looking at myself, and I wish I wasn't such a faiIure. I do not have any family or friends at all.I've never had a Girłfrienďl before, and I feel as if I'm just existing among people but not being seen, and I feel so alone because I suffer from social anxiety and autism. I too feel like an outsider.Loneliness has taken over my life. For the past year, I've been attempting to change. I've gone to social events such as groups, bars, and other public places, but I've never had success. Rather, I simply go to college, return home, and do it all over.Then I attempted online dating, which is challenging even though there were no matches. It doesn't help that my family doesn't really want me around, I don't really have family that I can spend time with.I believe that there is nothing left for me in this world, and that in the near future, only loneliness and unhappiness will exist for me. I appreciate you reading, and I wish you happiness in life.",0
"i cant do this anymore. nothing in my life is working. my entire life has been a series of unfortunate events. i have nothing and no one. my parents are narcissists. i have no money. my car is owed 4k that i dont have. i live with my divorced parents and im 34. i have no goals, barely any friends, no on i can rely on.i had the perfect situation. i had an amazing partner who was in law school. we had our little family with our dogs. i pushed her away and she blocked me everywhere. she discarded me like a piece of trash. im alone crying. SSRIs no longer work. i really dont see the point of any of this anymore. i want to shoot myself in the head in front of my ex's car. i fucking hate her ",0
I have no will to to do anything. I don't want to live in this evil world. GOD please take me. Lost my job due to depression. Depression made my IQ low. I have no friends. I just rot in bed all day.,0
"When I was 21, I lost my best friend of 10 years to suicide. I could hardly deal with the pain, I was going to college for a chemistry degree but I abandoned that plan entirely because I couldn't focus. It took a couple of years to get myself together enough to find a job and start living my life again. Fast forward to 26, I was in a very happy mindset. I've been doing well on my own, paying bills with no problem and being generally content. I had another best friend. Someone I could talk to daily and be captivated by every word she said. For the better part of 2 years, I shared my daily life with her. You probably see where this is going, but 3 weeks ago I got a suicide text from her. And I haven't heard from her since. I don't know what I plan to gain by posting this. All I know is it's very hard for me to make connections to such a level. And if I'm going to take a loss like this every few years of my adult life, it feels entirely pointless to try. I think I'm just the kind of person who dies alone. ",0
"Im diagnosed with depression for more than 4 years, I struggle with it for last 6 to 7 years. It gets worse and worse with every month, week, day. Im getting older, but im more and more useless, I can't work, go to school like a normal person, I can't keep up with normal people, im just unfit to do anything. How is it possible for me to go through life like this? Why am i like this? Why cant i be normal? Why me?",0
"Like the title says, i feel unlovable. For some context, i am a highly functioning autistic 19 year old male. I'm overweight, but currently on a weight loss journey. For all of my life i have always been the bully victim at worst, and a backup/2nd choice at best. I've never had many friends. I currently only have one, and i know it's just a matter of time before he leaves too.   It all started 4 years ago when i was 15. I got into a fight with a friend and the entire friend group at the time decided to ditch me then and there. I was then alone and bullied for the next 2 years.   I also at this time found a girlfriend. She left me not too long after and it didnt help my case. I have been to multiple psychiatrists, received multiple diagnoses, and have gotten countless of ""just go outside! youll feel much better"".  It all just breaks me down and i cant ever seem to win in any situation im in. Even now as im typing this im worried im making no sense and its all confusing, if so, im sorry for that.  I had to drop out of school because of a suicide attempt and me just generally hating life and since then, ive just stayed at home, doing nothing. My parents havent told me anything yet but i know for a fact they despise me doing this. I have two siblings and i 100% know that im the least favorite out of all of us.  I'm bad at social stuff. i have a severe stutter so any attempt at gaining confidence gets shut down immediately. I get easily angry at people better looking than me, more successful than me, and just people in general who i deem to be ""better"" than me. I could never ever in my life imaging a girl genuinely liking me, and like i said, it makes me feel unlovable. I feel like a failure of a human being and my suicide attempt should have worked out. I genuinely don't know what to do, and i dont expect anyone to give me any solutions, i just needed to vent as i have no one else to vent to. lmao, isnt that just pathetic? Im opening up about my feelings to a random internet forum instead of telling my ""nearest and dearest"" whoever the fuck they could be. Anyways, thanks for listening i guess, cheers.TLDR: I kinda suck at life",0
I’m so tired of this torment I’m in Everyday I wake up wishing I didn’t get upMy mom always yells at me and calls me uglyI have no reason to live anymore I lost all my friends and girlfriend I tried to get help but the doctor just prescribed me hunger medication I’m hoping that I die I know that my mom wouldn’t care if I’m dead I’d be happy when I’m dead ,0
"It feels like I just hate myself for even existing. It doesn’t matter what I do or achieve, I’ll barely acknowledge my accomplishments, but if I mess up once, just once… whether it’s big or small, I completely lose it.  if someone reassures me that everything is fine it just further engraves into my mind that I fucked up. I don’t get how others are just capable of forgetting and moving on.I fucking hate, I feel like a miserable piece of shit that should crawl in to a hole and die without ever being seen again. A loser like me isn’t capable of surviving on his own.",0
Used to beat myself with a metal rod or punch my face for like one year. Then today i first cut myself in the chest 6times so that no one can see it. And i feel sooo happy after that. I am planning to catch the bus in late august. Trust me when i say this there’s no help for me tried everything.,0
"I don't even know why I'm still alive, I don't have the energy to do anything, nothing excites me.I'm in college and considering to drop out because I'm just wasting my time here no matter how much I concentrate, I can't focus.From the past 6 months I tried to be rude to my parents, so they hate me and when I kill myself they don't feel much sad but my parents always been sweat no matter how rude I've behaved they always responded with love and that's the only thing that is keeping me alive.I've tried therapy but it's not helping much I feel nothing can help me anymore.I've turned 23 today, I was sitting in my room crying like loser, I have no friends and people in my collage thinks I'm freak because they have seen scars on my arm.Thank you for reading, have a great day.",0
Have been waiting to cease to exist for a long time now but keep waking up. Don’t want to die painfully as life is already painful enough. My life is deteriorated along with my increasing depression. If I’m “supposed to” live for another 45 years the loneliness is eating me. Can’t wrap my head around bringing someone else into my miserable life. Always wanted kids but why bring this burden onto someone else? What do you do?,0
"I’m 20 married with a baby. Got married after we found out I was pregnant because we’re both military. Husband is full time and i’m part time. My family is very proud of me because i’m in school, raising a son, in the military and married (which is an accomplishment because I come from a line of unmarried women) My husband does know about my history of depression. The truth is that i’m so overwhelmed with everything in my life and sometimes I just shut down. My family doesn’t know this because every time i’m around them I put on a mask to convince them i’m fine but i’m really not.I just don’t want them to be disappointed in me and i’m scared.My husband usually keeps his gun in our room and today I asked him if he could remove it away from me because I had some thoughts of hurting myself. I’m just struggling so bad mentally and I don’t know what to do. My husband told me that now he’s uncomfortable with leaving me alone with our son since when i’m upset I throw things and stuff. But I would never hurt my baby, it’s myself that I want to hurt. I just feel like I made the right choices in life but at the wrong time.I’ve gotten a referral for therapy from my doctor but it took me months to get an appointment and by the time the appointment came, I felt fine so I ended up not going.",0
"Was abused growing by many different people. Bullies, teacher, family and neighbors all the way until highschool. Got a little tougher then the girl problems began. Always started good then would fall apart. I rarley was the one who left and they would all cheat on me. Betrayals galore which brought me down pretty hard. Doing business with brothers and would be robbed of what i was owed after also withholding the money for an entire year. This is not detailed at all. Just dont want to write forever. Im at a point where i have no friends anymore, dont talk to my brothers or thier kids, cousins and uncles hate my guts. I cant make new friends or get a gf because my anger for people is insane. I cant be near people without trolling them to hell.. No clue why i do this, to push them away? This just sucks and im so sad that i dont know what to do anymore. ",0
"Hi, my name is Treethorn. I'm new to Reddit and suffer from major depression. I'm not sure what the self-introduction protocol is around here, but this is my attempt (tried to post a few days ago, but didn't have enough karma apparently).I'm now 57 and have been dealing with depression since my early teens. All I do is sleep and lie in bed looking at escapist distractions on the internet. I never leave the house, rarely leave or clean my room, and have no money, no prospects. I feel utterly defeated and sick with self-loathing, as though there's nothing left for me in life. I think frequently about killing myself.Fwiw, I am medicated. I take citalopram and bupropion. They help mitigate the worst of my symptoms, but I'm still essentially dead inside. I haven't held a job in two years and am horribly lonely. Late last year, I was hospitalized for suicidal ideation and subsequently spent some time homeless, though I now have a stable living situation. While I have self-harmed, I have never attempted suicide in earnest.My only goal in life is to own a cat. I'm too poor for that now. Any/all feedback appreciated.",0
I feel like all I do is disappoint everyone no matter what I do. I am a cook and love it but I work in two different kitchens for 2 different companies and I feel like I don’t enjoy anything anymore. I am constantly being yelled at at one place or the other and it’s so draining. I try and cope with dark humor and most people find it funny but what if they go to hr and then I get in more trouble. I work so damn hard and I don’t get any credit or recognition I feel like I am a failure.,0
"Wellbutrin worked on giving me (19f) a sex drive, but wasn't helping me with my depression. I am currently on Zoloft and now I feel almost asexual. Is there anything I can do to combat this lowered libido?",0
"I (20F) feel like i don’t have any energy left for life which is strange because im only 20. I do have a history of struggling with my mental health and only recently have I been able to function a bit better. I often get a sudden feeling of dread when i think about life. I can’t help but feel very depressed when i think about the future or even the present. I live in a third world country that just keeps getting worse politically and economically. I am ambitious and wish to accomplish my academic goals but I can’t put in the effort that is needed for that. I guess that just means I yearn to learn and accomplish. Worrying about money has become an every day thing for me even though me have a good family income (middle class) My dysfunctional family also wears me down. I am getting therapy which is working in some areas but I still seem to be stuck. Even if I somehow convince myself to be optimistic about my future and about potentially going abroad for education, my family bursts that bubble by telling me they won’t allow that. It makes me feel stupid about wanting something like that in the first place. Like i’m not worthy or capable enough for that. Other than that, I feel very hopeless about the prospect of finding someone i like and who likes me back and is a good person. I just feel like i can only see people live a good life from far away but i cannot be a part of that. Oh, and i feel horribly guilty when i say this because there are so many people in the world going through absolute worst circumstances so it does not make sense for me to whine about this but i cannot control my honest feelings, can i?",0
"I have seen some videos talking about it and I have seen many people across internet saying they are ready to let this world we live in go. Specially when people talk about end of the world theories and many issues the current world has and faces as a whole, this is why I wonder if it is the case, personally I am both scared and worried about what something like that would mean to me, so I choose not to commit suicide, but I get more people don't feel like they have a way out and I have been thinking about it for some time.

"I’m a 19 year old girl and I think about dying a lot. I don’t think I’m suicidal as I don’t think I would kill myself but I do think about it a lot, like driving my car into a tree or over a bridge or overdosing on pills but I wouldn’t really do it. I just feel like sometimes that it would be good to die but I wouldn’t do it myself. I guess  wouldn’t mind if it was an accident but I just wouldn’t do it. I realise that this line of thinking isn’t normal and that there is something wrong with me but I don’t feel suicidal. I don’t really know what to do or how to fix those thoughts. ",0
"I'm just tired of this goddamn world, everyone is pushing forwards while im here doing no useful shit but just existing, i lost joy in my things i loved... i simply want to stay at my room talking to no one and it makes me feel like shit.

"My life is currently a joke right now and I'm trying to do anything to improve it but so far it's gotten me no where. I'm trying to study for my A+ certificate because I'm trying to apply for a tech job and I'm studying because apparently obtaining an ITF plus isn't enough. I've also tried reconnecting with my siblings, but that only lead to no responses from my brother and a huge fight with my sister. Plus I tried cutting my mother out of my life due to her abusive behavior and I thought it would solve my problems but never did, considering how my upbringing has negatively affected my adulthood. I'm also autistic with bipolar, but I could never get rid of my mood swings no matter how much I try. So instead of trying to please people that won't do a fucking thing for me, I just isolate myself in my apartment, smoke weed, and browse on my PC or play games on it. It's the only thing that I feel like doing anymore, and I'm a 31 year old autistic man with practically nothing to live for. ",0
"I wear the same clothes for longer and working from home allows me to get away with it. I haven't showered for four weeks,  only being in a swimming pool at weekends with the kids.

I really don't know what to do anymore. July has been awful to not only me but my family. Finally after 4 weeks of hell two members of my family shared good news with me and I just feel numb I literally feel nothing at all. I just paint on a happy face and then cry when I'm alone away from my partner and child. I can't go on like this but I also can't tell people I'm not ok and I'm not coping because then I become that person that buts the burden on there good news and brings everyone down and I just can't be that person . I can't even talk to my partner becaus when I try he tells me I'm wrong to feel the way I do. He just doesn't understand. My head is a mess and I really don't know what to do. ,0
"Nothing ever goes right. Not sure if it’s just that I suck that much at everything or if it’s a mixture of bad luck. I never get a good break when it actually matters or the situation has any actual significance. I got pretty close to having a shot at my dreams but idk I kinda fucked up and the added stress of my mom clinging on to control of my life made it impossible. Not only did I watch my dreams crash and burn, but also my backup plan got crushed literally when I got hurt at work. I’m smart enough to learn how to do stuff, but don’t really have any skills that can get me a job above minimum wage now that I might not even be able to stand for extended periods. I have to restart my life at 27 and after two years of struggling/fighting with work comp and my settlement isn’t even going to be enough to put a down payment on a decent used car lol I was miserable before but now I don’t even want to leave my bed. I’m not really asking for sympathy nor do I think I deserve it because yes I had a rough childhood but I choked or fucked up every opportunity I had in life before I got hurt anyways which is why I was working that not so great job anyways. Idk I don’t feel very human anymore. I’m a shell. I don’t know who or what I am or if I am really anything at all. I want to not be here but not aliving myself would just hurt the few people who kinda care about me so I can’t. ",0
"I’ve gone to five different therapists. According to my psychiatrist, I’ve tried every conventional medication and combination of medications to treat depression. I’ve also done a full TMS treatment. Well over $10,000 to try and get better. None of it has made a dent whatsoever, I’ve been consistently severely depressed for around 9 years now",0
"I feel miserable until now can't even talk about it with anybody feel that people see me as a bad person and nothing to do with that mistake I don't know why I did it I became depressed person who can't get over it and can't walk without thinking about it and cry can't eat well can't feel happy or safe hating myself and how I look and think how people will see me because more anxious about anything that I deal with even when I know new people and that makes me losing them I miss old me funny me that didn't care about others opinion I don't know why I became that sensitive I feel that god make people leave me because if they know they gonna hate me If I could go back in time and not do this thing, I would.

"Im wondering if anyone else has experienced this?The past few weeks depression has gotten real bad. When im at home, ive been isolating myself in my room. Just lying in bed. Usually feeling awful and crying. But last night, something just, snapped. I cant explain it.I still couldnt shake the awful thoughts and feelings, but rather than zero energy and willpower, i was up and bouncing around, also i could not control my laughter. I felt light as a feather. Everytime awful thoughts flooded my head, i simply laughed. But i still felt really bad inside. When i look at my SH spots, i usually spiral further. But last night, i still felt like spiraling, but couldnt stop laughing instead of crying.Ive never experienced this before. This definitely doesnt feel normal and it feels like im going insane.",0
"I've been out of work for about a month now because HR were d\*cks and I just got my unemployment. but for the longest time my boyfriend as been using me as a piggy bank. I know he says he isn't but I've been helping his rent for so long it just hurts and when I want to buy something like doodash he makes me feel guilty about it. I've putt a lot of money into him and he never does for me a lot. I just feel so lost because I love him so much but I just feel like nothing to him. either someone he's next to bed, or just a roommate. I just want us to be happy but I can't due to the guilty feeling of wanting to spend like a little but of money.   I take therapy every Tuesday and its cab up, but he makes me feel bad for getting that or a $3 soda when im done my session. I grew up with money always being tight so I understand the savings aspect but when I want to he says we have bills to pay and when I do. we split the rent three ways with his dad but he never comes up with his half. why do I cry everything this happens I just want him to find work and be happy but I'm not. I paid his rent, paid his phone bill one month so I count pay mine till a week later. and whenever I ask for the money back he waits till something big happens.am I worthless? I can't say no a lot and the one time when he asked me money for weed it turned into a big fight. how come I have to do everything while he sits on his ass and plays bloodborne.   he also doesn't like to do things with me unless im upset and when I agree and want to do things he says that we can do together he says he's to tired for it now. I'm sorry for venting about this but somedays I can't talk to both my therapist and my mother about it and I just feel so alone, thank you for anyone listening.",0
"Am I the only one who feels like this?My heart feels sore from being in this state. It's probably an exaggeration. But it feels like that. It feels like it has been put on a fridge.

There are times also when I feel like actually something pokes/stings me in my heart, when I'm really overwhelmed sometimes it feels like that.Most of the time, I feel the heaviness on my chest.Sometimes it feels like rusty iron and rotten.I just wanted to share this post about how my heart physically feels with this crap. It's sickening and tiring.Don't worry about anything physical.

"Hello Everyone, First of all, I hope you're all doing great.I (F/29) am having a rather hard time mentally these past few weeks, since I'm struggling with feelings of loneliness, emotional neglect, depression (I think) and just a sense of not being important in relation to my family (mother &amp; younger brother).Most of the struggles I am currently still going through, is related to a sudden MS Diagnosis I received almost exactly a year ago &amp; multiple other smaller health issus that had to be taken care of &amp; addressed until recently.Since I've always been rather athletic and took care of my health meticulously since my teenage years, all these sudden health issues felt like life was playing a bad joke on me.In addition to that, I didn't have a full time job (just part-time), since my diagnosis, because it happend right after graduating from college and everything just hit me like a train.My mother, has supported me financially throughout this time and I am extremely grateful for her helping me out and promised to pay her back in thime (I always keep my word, I think it's only fair). Currently I am applying for full-time positions in my field again, because the financial burden has become to great for my mother (understandably) and I also only want to live a normal life again and get back on track.Now just earlier, I talked with my mom on the phone and had gotten really emotional, communicating that I had suicidal ideations after her constant harsh treatment towards me (telling me I need to learn to deal with everything on my own and not look for emotional support in regards to my MS etc.) and that I didn't understand why - or felt like they don't take my illness seriously (fatigue - especially in this summer heat, numb &amp; painful hand, fear of the future etc.). She answered in her usual way of saying that she didn't want to talk &amp; that it is my decision to end my life - nothing she can do about it.My brother, unfortunately also leans towards a rather stoic and emotionless respons in situations where I would appreciate some kind words. That's all I want. Not to be kicked when I already feel at my lowest... This is not the first time, she told me this, when I communicated my hurts to her, and it freaking hurts like hell when she talks to me in this way.  I pushed myself through so many appointments for an entire year, without having any help or assistance from anyone.I live alone, my apartment is spotless, I'm trying to get my energy back and am working with a great neurologist to get my energy levels back again after all these medical precedures etc.I'm taking part in a research study for future MS treatments and applying for jobs again.I communicated to my family that I would appreciated them visiting or at least calling me more &amp; asking how I'm doing, but they just don't get it. They just don't seem to care or see what I have gone through or how much effort I put into things - trying to fix my life again.My mother told me today, that:""You're not sick. You can still do everything as before.""I AM SICK - I PUSH THROUGH SO NO ONE SEES HOW FREAKING TIRED &amp; FATIGUED I AM ALL OF THE TIME! SO EVERYONE KEEPS FEELING COMFORTABLE SINCE APPARENTLY THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH PEOPLE HAVING A HARD TIME OR BEING SAD ONCE DURING A FULL MOON OR FEELING LONELY SINCE NO ONE COMES TO VISIT FOR 5 MONTHS! (Sorry about that...)Even hours of talking on the phone and trying to explain myself is a lost cause and only ends up in me being gaslit &amp; putting all of the emotional responsibilities onto me again. I guess we actually don't need any human connection or support when I apply the logic of my family.I'm not so delusional to think that I won't reclaim the life that I want and always strived for. I just had bad luck for a bit over a year I suppose. It happens. The only thing I need &amp; actually always wanted, is being heard, loved and just seen for who I am, what I feel and how I experience my reality. It just feels like I can scream as loud as I want &amp; cry as much as I want and no one is listening. I'm so exhausted.I just want a hug.How the hell do you deal with life while feeling unheard and emotionally abandoned?",0
"At this point i just want to end it its so unbearable im just in agony its been going on for 4 years. I am not social dont know how to talk to people, spend most of my days alone. Sometimes i dont know how i feel i sort of feel dead inside like even if i tried describing it to someone i have absolutely no words to match my feelings. People have said to me it gets better i waited i tried doing anything to make it better but it never turned out thay way. Every night i wonder why it has to be this way why am i this weak to not be able to make changes it drains me sm.  Lately ive been thinking about ending it because i really cant be living like this anymore i cant remember the last time i enjoyed existing. Ive never really had a conversation with someone who could help or understand me usually they just make it seem like its no big deal or something. Can any of you give me any advice is it really worth living ? Is there something too  look forward to? Ik most people would say i shouldnt end it but i just cant take it . It wont get better",0

"My first memory (either 2 or 3 years old) is a screaming match between my mom and dad, after which, my dad left in his car for several hours and I believed he was never coming home again. While he was a good father in other ways, it doesn't excuse the selfish and childlike behavior my dad subjected me and my family to growing up. Of all the memories I have of my dad, the ones that are most prominent and stand out the most are of him screaming at me, belittling me, only to sweep it under the rug a day or so later with some bullshit apology and a present to buy my apology. Additionally, he neglected to socialize me almost entirely, making it so that I basically had to develop all my social skills from scratch *way* later than my peers. This is how I learned to always be incredibly submissive to the wants and anger of other people, leading me down a childhood/adolescence of bullying, isolation, depression, and (the worst in my opinion) depersonalization/lack of identity. To cope I became a chameleon, adopting the personality of those around me with truly no inherent grasp of my own. Besides my lack of social ability as a child, I was bullied and tormented by others because of reasons beyond my control, namely racism and people who told their children to dislike me because of my family. In school I was incredibly studious and tried to be kind to everyone. That never helped at all. It was constant torment, (never physical, just emotional) as I was meticulously pulled apart by people because I was different. While I was able to have a handful of friends, bad luck resulted in every friend I made moving away by the point I had entered middle school. I was incredibly lonely, and basically just drifted those few years. Once in high school, I made it my mission to join what I saw as the popular crew (keep in mind, what I *saw* as lack of any social skills blinded me to the fact that these guys were the worst douchebags and everyone hated them). To do this, I basically hung around long enough to the point where I was just part of the group by association, even though it basically meant I was their punching bag for verbal abuse and always being the butt of the joke. My positive memories with them have nothing to do with anything good happening, just being moments where they didn't tear me to shreds with their words. But being around the group made people dislike me more by associate because they disliked these guys for being total jerks. So essentially, not only was I getting bullied more regularly and intensely now, but everyone else hated me because they thought I was like them. For sake of not making this incredibly long, I'm skipping over a lot of detail and nuance. But after high school, my life began to improve dramatically. I made better friend groups with people who actually were kind to me and friendly, I went to college and began to discover myself, all was well. And then covid hit and we all went home and I lost all my newly gained friends. And I was back at home, alone. At that point I was at the roughest point in my life. It was like I had finally been given a taste of what having fun and being young was about, and it was ripped away from me almost instantly. Even once I returned to college, my core friend group just sort of fell apart and didn't hang out, and I spent most of my time in my dorm (still covid so couldn't go into common area and meet people) by myself doing drugs and playing video games. I barely made it through the semester and honestly was probably on track to dropping out the next simply because of how unhappy and riddled with depression I was. Over break, I met someone through mutual friends and we instantly fell for each other. She was my first significant other, even counting all the lame middle/high school relationships which I was never a part of. We were so in love. And it was good, and compassionate, and caring, and respectful. She was a shining beam of light in my life that I never had before and she validated all the struggle and pain I went through in my life. I was able to tell her about myself, and she, also coming from a place of incredible trauma, was able to truly relate and understand me. It was the first time in my life I felt I ever had anyone genuinely know and care about me as a person. While part of me was just okay with having someone to make my deep seated insecurities pushed to the side, I know that this was actually true love and I was truly happy with her. We were even having talks about potentially buying a house and getting married.We stayed together through the remainder of college, during which my grades improved drastically. After graduating, after we had been together many years, our relationship ended in a hellish fireball I never saw coming. In the span of a few months we went from ""perfect"" to horribly toxic. She left me, lied to me, took advantage of me financially, abused me emotionally, used things I told her in confidence against me, and cheated on me. I did everything I could to repair the damage as it happened but it was gone and destroyed. I begged to fix things and try to patch things up but she treated me like garbage, like I was a stranger and didn't know her. In the many months after, I was horribly depressed and suicidal. I honestly don't know how I made it through everything I did all alone (I should add, during/after my relationship I had lost nearly all my friends, some through falling outs, some as they were originally hers, but mostly just through growing up and having our own lives). I focused on myself and my career and was able to make it through, as difficult as it was. I recognized looking back obvious red flags in our relationship which I had thought of as minor road bumps we could conquer together initially. I don't want her back now, and I would never let her back into my life. But in all honesty, those years with her were the happiest years of my life by far, and nothing even remotely compares to it. When I look back at my life, even with consideration that those years were the most recent, they make up the overwhelming majority of truly happy memories in my lifetime. So now we reach my current life. I am at a great job with great pay and great potential to move into other positions making incredible money, not just for someone my age, but great for anyone. I have an apartment in a good neighborhood where I live peacefully and make myself healthy food and life an overall good life from an outward perspective. But internally I'm dead inside. I have a toxic family dynamic, no real friends, and no longer any significant other in my life. The irony is, that even now, as lonely as I am, when I reach out for any of those categories I get a full dose of either shitty parenting, shitty friends, or shitty situation ships where I don't even care about the other person. It's like I'm a ping pong ball caught between being lonely or dealing with horrible people as I just can't seem to find someone who is tolerable (ie: doesn't abuse me and actually wants to spend time with me \[impossible combo\]). The only feelings I have are complete numbness and then random bouts of horrible despair and depression where whatever I'm doing comes to a complete halt as I mentally deal with it to prevent from spiraling. On occasion I feel incredibly manic (I'm going to conquer the world, become a billionaire, etc. etc.) which usually is quickly followed by more depression. This can all occur on a daily basis. I have to gaslight myself to get anything done. I'd say I'm fairly productive, but unless I trick myself into performing basic self care, things won't get done. Even in moving on, my current trauma and pathetic social skills (note how I don't say shyness, I really mean social skills) put a strong buffer on my ability to build new relationships. I think the worst thing of all is that I truly loved and still do love all the horrible people in my life. I've always just wished they would accept me, and I could never understand the reasoning why not. I don't know why I still feel drawn to many of these people, as many of them were actually terrible and took full advantage of me. Yet I just have that wish to be loved and this pain of rejection that I wish above all else they would just love me. I have been to therapy, but it didn't help. I plan on returning with someone new, but I am just so tired all the time. As stupid as it sounds, I wish I could just wish there to be a single person in my life who would hold my hand (literally and metaphorically) when life gets tough and guide me along. I wish there was someone who I could place my absolute faith in without the constant fear that they would undercut me and leave me for dead. I wish there was someone who, when they tell me something, I can believe it without knowing they are a liar. I know it's possible for someone to be this person, because I've been this person in nearly all the relationships throughout my life. But for now I keep going because there's nothing else to do. I don't plan on going anywhere, even though I am not hopeful. I do my best to improve myself in whatever ways I can. And I do continue to try to reach out to people, even though stuff never works out at all. Even posting this, in a way, is really just a way for me to get some of the social interaction I'm lacking. I hope if you're reading this and you can relate that you've gotten better/are in the process of getting better. ",0
I hate life and I don't remember  what happiness feels like,0
"I don’t want to work anymore. I don’t want to learn anything new. I don’t want to go anywhere. Getting through a conversation with anyone is like pulling teeth. I just simply don’t care anymore. Am I selfish? Am I fucking crazy? I don’t put the effort into friendships anymore. My relationship with my partner is circling the drain. No one genuinely asks the question ‘how have you been lately?’ And genuinely listens to how you’ve been. I’m not enough and I’ve never felt like I was enough. Childhood trauma keeps a hand on my shoulder no matter how much healing and working through things I do. Life doesn’t get any better regardless of how many times I pick myself up and convince myself that’s it’s going to be ok. Life is tough, I’ve known that since I can remember holding conscious thoughts. I’m almost 30 years old is it some sort of crisis? Will I snap out of it? I made diet changes, and lifestyle changes years ago. I gave up alcohol over a year ago. I’m honest, probably to a fault sometimes. Why can’t I shake this feeling of not good enough, not doing enough, you’ll never be happy. What is happy? How do I find it? These questions are rhetorical. I don’t expect answers, I just need to get it out of my head. ",0

"(24f) my father has always had big dreams for me, he doesn’t have a lot of money but he would give everything for my education. I graduated a foreign school in my country which was a success.

All these years I’ve been staying in my room most of the time, with some efforts to go out. I feel so so bad and guilty almost like a monster to him.

"I have no hope for the future honestly. I dont even care about being poor or working, or the state of the world really at this point.

I can't even try, I meet no one. I feel like I'll be alone forever, and I cant even express how that makes me feel. Being alone is awful, and it is this way everyday and has been for about 3 years. I have almost noone in my life and it kills me inside. I feel worthless. I just want it to end. I have tried so hard to fix this, but it only seems to get worse as I get older. I wish I had a way to find peace in life without human connection, but that is obviously impossible. This is the worst it has felt in a long time. ",0
I lwork far away from my home and only get to spend a week at a time there. Normally it’s never been an issue with me. But lately I’ve been working 90-40 days straight without going home. I stoped taking my medication awhile back and have been feeling way better. But lately the depression and loneliness have gotten bad. I even back to my suicidal mindset. I don’t know what to do anymore. Mostly just wanted to get this off my chest. Thank you if you read though this,0
"How is it that when the medication wears of and the depression is back in the first thing I feel is being discussed by everyone who is around. Be it friend of foe all I feel is being repulsed by them - actions, words and even looks. What fallows is a need for dissimilation,  destruction and suffering. Not mine... Not yet. But I find myself feeling some twisted joy in suffering of friends, strangers and others. Not causing it, but knowing they are suffering. Than comes the destruction with little words, with little gestures to bring them down - people around me. I find myself fantasising about methodically deconstructing and destroying my life. Hurting the ones I love, the ones who hope, the ones who love me. Destroying my home, carrier and finally when there is noone to grif when I'm gone myself. The only sanity left is fear - fear of those feelings and thoughts, and that one day, another time when I'm again coming off yet another medication that failed me the fear will be gone... Writing this hear is a failsafe. Hope that helps someone or at least me in the future. ",0

Feel alone in my situation 18 male and I’ve had worst depression for like little bit over a year now. Right before that I was best I felt in my entire life. I felt like i was almost on top of the world. After years of being insecure of my appearance in middle school and freshman and sophomore year I started working out and eating healthy and felt and looked best I’ve ever had. Sometimes I couldn’t stop looking at myself in mirror cause I was so obsessed with how good i looked which is a feeling I want back so badly. My dream at time was to be a model and a movie actor and those dreams seemed like it was gonna be a reality and I was living life to fullest and then I got chemical burn on my eyelids and it’s ruined my appearance ever since. I just completely lost myself and stopped caring about myself. I didn’t get proper treatment on my eyes until a year later of the incident and I’m on month three of my treatment and it feels like it’s taking forever for that normal feeling to come again. It makes me lack so much confidence in approaching ppl especially with women. And to make things worse was I found an awesome therapist who I adored but I wasn’t able to talk with her after php which was horrible. I feel like unless my eyes are healed I’m not good enough for a women to be with me. I’ve done some bad things to cope with my depression and it still makes me end up lonely but worse. I’m hoping my eyes heal up fully so I get my life back on track but I have fear that my life will be like this for rest of my life.  ,0

"My parents died when I was 5, so I was raised in foster care. I had terrible foster parents, all of which hated me for various reasons.

Cause what doesn’t kill us make us stronger, right?I can’t help but to cry every time I remember everything I lost.I’m clinging to one thing - out of all the things gone, I gained the most important thing I ever thought I wouldn’t have. The person I want to be with for the rest of my life. I’m giving all the strength that was left in me to create a new chapter of my life with her. Cause I’m really not getting any younger. I’m beyond thankful for her and I wish she really is the person I’m looking for. Cause everything I lost - IT’S ALL WORTH IT.

I was bullied from grade 4 and it only stopped in grade 10. When I was 22 my nephew died infront of me agter we where struck by lightning, after that I was robbed at gun point at work and got my hands and feets tied and they gaged me and left me for dead.I was in a physicaly and mentally abusive relationship for 5 years so after all that I went back to my hometown, that was just aftery father died from negligence at a hospital when he was sick.My grandfather qas my father figure thru my life, because I lived with him as a child, my father lived in a different city 1000km away. 1 week after I got back to my hometown my grandfather passed away. The list goes on.I've been in pills and I've seen spoke to a professional once a week for 1 full year and nothing seem to help, after a met my wife and had my kid I thought everything will change but still I am depressed daily and just want to end it all not even the thought of my family makes me feel better.Sometimes I wish I never met my wife, because it would be easier to kill myself If i didn't know her and had a child.

"I'm 21/f. ive been suffering since the past few months/years - somehow convinced my mother to pay for some pysch tests. ive been diagnosed w severe anxiety and depression, also also pdd and depressive personality patterns. offlate i get these panic attacks where i almost choke on my own words and i cant breathe and life seems to end and they dont go away for 30-35 mins after which my body literally cant physically take anymore. i dont even know my triggers anymore. im stuck in a job where my brain rots everyday, im exploited for the amount of money im paid for there are no work timings anything can come anytime and you have to attend. ive topped through my school studied sm but now im here just booking flight tickets for this man, taking moms and scheduling meetings. the love of my life who i dated for 4 years is now super enthusiastic about moving on and likes someone else. we now are supposed to be no contact. for the past 5 years, even after the breakup, ive lived my life w him literally next to me every day through every thing, he's my best friend and now suddenly im expected to never talk to him again. and did i mention i have no friends in the city anymore. college ended 2 months back and all of them either went away for jobs or back to them homes. my college results just came out, im way below what i need to get into any of my dream colleges. ive given up on gre, my body can barely make it to the next room studying is not an option. ive stopped eating. 2 pieces of something in a whole day. my dad thinks im making this up all of this is not science. im living w them btw because my job is wfh. oh also i have excessive protein in my body and im at extremely high risk of getting a cardiac arrest.   i really need help if there is anyone reading this, i cant believe im posting this but pls this is a call for help!!! i cannot take this anymore :(",0

"I get bullied so bad to the point bad things has been spread on my name for years now some of which are lies, my own family treats me terrible my as well, I went on a date with a guy who was intimate with me I was young so I became like really wanting to be with this person, but I didn’t know on his end he may have been talking bad like I’m a crazy girl who only wants intimacy or whatever, and ppl who already hated me are hating me more plus family and everyone who has heard, so I’m 25 now I get harassed everyday at work my phone is hacked so ppl can tell me everything on here and I’m cyber bullied so I literally have ppl on the other side of the country bullying me and in different countries, I have no body who doesn’t hate me in my life and then some of lies out there is ppl say I was a gold digger that’s why I was treated like that when I just graduated college and was young and on my own idk 🤷🏾‍♀️ but that’s what I heard , or that I’m just easy or whatever he and I did go fast but he was the only person that happened with so it just is crazy to me how after that one time that’s just me , so now when I try to date or whatever they make it seems like I am only there for what they have and that I’m easy and like I said because this also cyber bullying so much ppl think of me that way all over I wouldn’t know where to go and because ppl didn’t have more than this to get mad at it grew the hate that everyone have on me they will say it’s different reasons I’m getting this treatment now when it stemmed from this date situation, I digress . But as I was saying now dating I don’t even have the courtesy of a normal conversation I’m treated like I’m stupid and like I’m indifferent, and also when I go through tough situations I tend to get in a place I’m alone and say my thoughts out loud because it gets it off my chest and not every time I want to speak to someone about this it has always been a secret place for me that I would never give out because I know I humiliation but it is my way of coping but what happened is during this because I guess ppl wanted to see what’s up with me and be nosey they found out I do this and because it’s a habit when I am going through a lot I end in a quiet place and let my thoughts out I can’t stop right away especially now you have so much against me like family everybody around and cyber bullying too I triggers this even more I guess and I can look to be overwhelmed, and that gets thrown in my face subtly when dating, then ppl just want to take advantage of me because of the situation with the guy absolutely no one heard me out it’s like automatically it was my fault and I was just a easy gold digger , and ppl keep trying to treat me like that even though I keep pushing that idea away I’ve ended up in two relationships since this happened that didn’t last but I would always let them know they never have to do things for me for me to stay then I would accept them doing it then they would be like acting like so the rumours are true anything to make a point I feel since this date with this guy and since this situation I have lost my job and not able to work functionally because like I said ppl are bullying me there to so yes there were times that I was in need and the ppl I loved made me feel like they didn’t have a problem which I would always try to make it up when I can in the best way I can , but that only came around when ppl was trying to prove a point that this is who I am and when the harassment took a toll on me not before when I first dated the guy so I truly don’t understand why, but everyone hates me. It’s like ppl know this isn’t my character but is wanting to set everything up for me to be pushed down that road for especially family I feel you would’ve wanted to pluck me out this mess and tell me the full truth on how it even got to them cuz I’m in a different country , and if they truly had my back like they said they wouldn’t let these ppl be my end all be all we would get back on even if it was with simply motivation and honesty but they don’t give me that. So because everyone hates me and the only way I feel I can be loved is by sexual abuse because again ppl think I’m easy and they just think that I’m this terrible person, maybe I should be what they want me to be , prostitute or whatever because  that’s the only love I will feel even if it’s not real, since this situation I’ve gotten some bad sexual experiences so really if I don’t change my mindset in the moment it can feel like I’m being attacked, so idk how much I would like it but it I’m always drunk or high or something I can start feel like it’s the best thing ever and I will feel like I’m not fully hated from the world hating me , you don’t even have to do anything for me I will freely be yours , this isn’t something I’ve done already at least not by my choice I don’t know the lies , but I will try since that’s the category I keep getting put in or I die. Because if I never get down to the bottom of exactly why my privacy was taken like this and who did it specifically and that’s the thing because it’s so many ppl everyone is covering ppl I can only assume it’s some of these situations, but if I get to the bottom of it will be the only time I find peace on my own otherwise going through this now makes me feel like dying and so hated you feel you need to find someone so you end up in the loop of being used, maybe I should sell myself for 10 minutes of love I desperately can’t give myself because of this bullying I’m so depressed or just die.",0

It’s been so long that even I can’t even remember but I still feel depressed, don’t have any friends to hang out with, and I have very bad social anxiety. I didn’t do very well in school and I left my job so I am now unemployed. There are many other things I have going on right now that I’m not going to share because it will be way too long so to keep things short. I want to die.

"I had reached a point where I was suicidal. Was in suicidal depression for months. The only thing that keeps me is my animals. In the end I couldn't commit. So I've slowly started putting my life back together. It's not a life I want to live though.It feels like the more everything changes, it really just stays the same. I feel invisible to other people. I don't seem to matter to anyone. Both a relieving and isolating feeling. I met someone I really hit it off with. It's been years since I felt that. We both expressed that we really liked each other. Yet they don't respond when I reach out. This has been a common experience over the past few years. I thought this time would be different since we seemed to have a real connection. I was wrong. So I'm just existing in this weird space. Nobody wanting anything to do with me. Me mostly not wanting anything to do with anyone else. Working just to have food and some entertainment. To be alone day after day. To just pass the time without much interest. I feel like a camera you don't notice is there. I observe the world around me, these days not passing much judgement on what I witness. It all feels inconsequential. I feel inconsequential.Now I'm in the space of knowing I'd rather not continue, yet I can't not continue. I come into contact with a lot of different people, from different walks of life. Occasionally I feel something but it's so dull. I long to feel envy, or pity, or connection. I have taken my shots at living the life I wanted and they all failed. It's left me feeling broken, disappointed, and changed. Or feeling like my light has been misplaced. I don't think I have it in me to try, seriously, at making a life. I guess I'm just running out the clock.",0

I can't date, but i am so jealous of her partner, and her friends. I want to be close with her like we used to be.It makes me suicidal. I yearn for her. I just want to take my sleeping pills and sleep forever. I feel so much guilt for the way I treated her. I wish i had made a different choice all those years ago.",0
"I believe only reason to live is experience new things you didn't experience before and see the forwards. I don't want to do repeating activities.When I was younger I was fillling myself with vast amount of knowledge found on Internet. Educating myself further I have collected knowledge in programming, graphics design and chemistry. Learning about something new everyday is what made me what I'm.  My personality is revolved around things that interest me, I do not have any friends who are interested in common things I do, lack of large friend group and being socially awkward doesn't make things any better but I grew up to tolerate it better. I'm diagnosed with Autism under label of PDD-NOS in age of 6 and I got rediagnosed at age 16.  I absorb knowledge easily, produce solutions and give answers to people or simply whoever is interested in my ideas. I like dumping large amounts of knowledge to whoever I meet.Yeah sure there are still large amount of things to learn, and it's impossible to collect all of them, but I can know enough to do many things and so anyone else can with spare time that everyone lacks after their childhood. I'm basically forced this way due to not being able to socialize properly, I want to build whatever I'm imagining myself, alone. This is pretty irrational since it is not possible to a single person to finish things in short amount of time, but this is what I'm. I will never able to have coworkers, or be a boss. Limting factor is how humans are made to work. Everything has a hierarchy it never changed since ancient times. Humans with greater power control ones with less power and those control even ones with less power but at the absolute bottom these ones are so weak they cannot be controlled and there are people so strong they cannot be controlled.Almost everything in past has a noticeable pattern. We cannot prove everything has a direct cause since how we exist is even a question at it's own that cannot be explained in a logical way. So many just prefer having a religion or simply don't mind personally I'm agnostic, there's no way to disprove or prove a creator so it's undefined. But in our current time frame almost everything has a input and output aka cause and result,  cause and result relationship cannot be well estabilished in many scenarios so this caused inaccuracy in reasoning, but for cases it can it allows a way to understand how everything ""resonates"" in a good balance. There's a pattern in way things work. Understanding relationships between different phenomena allows one of most powerful ways to learn new information, reason and produce new information.This gets to the point of you notice everything has so many common things you feel like you are just way too much full of information and cannot produce valid results for people who expect it. You notice how humans are still ""pre-programmed""  like other animals do but at a lesser extent.You notice that many things interested you were in your childhood, when you had strongest ability to connect the dots and understand patterns which this ability diminishes as you age.  I'm hungry for knowledge, I seek more knowledge and at end I'm still unhappy. Most of things we learn could been logically deducted from limited amount of knowledge you have. You notice that you can predict how something will end up before you read detailed information about a topic and you see you were generally right from start.This is what happened to me, what is the point of living even? I'm aware existental crisis can happen to anyone else but this is going for almost half a year. I enjoy nothing new,I live in Turkey where people even would have harder time to be great at what they are and instead forced into unknown situations in the moment they turn 18. When I was young I acted quite weird I would dream about things and flap my hands involuntarily when doing that, I was beaten up in school by teacher, I was subjected to multiple intelligence tests in my childhood as another result of my weirdness and somehow I did well in these tests those were only tests that I did score somewhat good, my mother always tell me ""you are smart whatever you are doing is weird I'm starting to doubt your intelligence"". I recently become obsessed with taking online IQ tests, I took so many of them and yet I got similar scores as I did in my childhood score which was 115, online scores were between range of 100 to 120. Still I believe I'm dumbest person around with small set of friends I have. Reminder that average IQ for Turkey is 87, considering that being almost 2 standard deviations above the average of the country is huge. This score isn't even in gifted range or something would give a person very superior abilities to the point they would be cogntiveily successful in almost anything mentally demanding. It's simply high average to bright intelligence for western countries. Nothing more nothing less at best I'm an awful software engineer with that. I struggle with even simple maths that even a person with lower intelligence can do maths at better speed than I can, I may able to understand it more detailed but they will still do it faster than me because I'm very very slow in daily life except for learning things.  I always mistake left and right, fail to follow directions correctly and have trouble understanding whatever they are trying to tell. I don't have an exact personality, It varies a lot, my limited set of friends say that my opinions suddenly changed, my opinions change so suddenly about a topic 10 minutes ago I would be saying  something else and now I would say something else, my brain is simply broken and not knowing about what could be cause of it is horrible, I'm not even sure if diagnoses I received to date are entirely correct.I feel like I'm losing a lot of my abilities, I had ability to learn something extremely fast and catch details but my  ability in this area seems to be decline back then when it takes to learn from one small wikipedia article with roughly 2000 words took one read now it takes two or three reads to remember the concept perfectly for long time.  I had strong tonal memory which I would able to memorize music and play it in head, it's kind like what people call as ""earworms"" but I was able to control mine and play whatever I wanted. I was able to keep a piece of music for 10+ years without forgeting it but now memorizing a piece of song is huge struggle for me. It barely even lasts a day, sometimes I forget within 10 minutes. I want my ability of remembering any song I hear back so much. It at least made my life more fun while it lasted.Overally I'm a person that many won't find interesting at all, I see no value in myself too. My currently only reason to exist is to see how well it'll turn out, if I manage to experience more good memories then I'll live if not then I'll end it up before turning 30 possibly by taking a shot to head.At least before I die I want to leave world my mark it might be small and irrelevant as hundreds of thousands already do it every year, people publish papers Elsevier and Springer profit from their papers and they receive almost nothing from it. Millions of papers reference each other and build a huge network of research to be exploited by major corporations (this includes news sites milking stuff out of research and turn it into clickbait)  World is such a shitty place that people are manipulated with money, money is the single most important discovery as in sense of human psychology, making unwilling participants to work together. Collaborate something that other animals mostly lack. Money was and is required to build the world we know of. Wish people can see the entire point is discovering things.",0
"Hello, I am 23y female and recently tried to go to a therapist since my thoughts were keeping me awake at night, thought about death and how it feels to die, how it would be like (I know that I won't do it, because of my family and few people around me ... but if I had nobody, then I do not see a purpose of being here ...), or the self harm, low self esteem, sleep struggle too much or so little, feeling worthless and useless, and lost, empty.... So I tried to book appointment,  but sadly they were fully booked, but then suddenly one took me in for at least consultation and told me that I've seeked out help at the right time, which made me feel relieved a little, but then the guilt started to creep out.     So I continued to get the help and got it after few weeks, yesterday actually. They admitted me to their hospital not like hospitalisation, but made me a card as their new patient (sorry english is not my first language), assigned me a psychotherapist and psychiatrist after the diagnostic examination with them with the diagnose of severe depressions.     But .... here is the but. What if I am not? What if I am just thinking that I do have something while in reality there is nothing? ... Every time I feel ... the way I feel, I am thinking about other people, that in the end I should be damn happy, since I got my dad, a roof above my head, bed, water, people at work, food ... things I wanted ... and then the guilt takes over that I should be grateful for what I have... and then I force myself to be normal once again, which lasts for few days sometimes a week or two  but then it goes back, and repeat. it is never ending circle. What if I am just using it as an excuse, what if it is just some weird need inside of me to have something and I have been faking it? I feel lost and confused. ",0
"I don’t know where to rant except here, so bear with me guys. Basically right now I’m feeling more hateful than I’ve ever been before, and I really wish I didn’t but that’s what happens when people put petty internet politics ahead of moral reasoning.Anyway, it ALWAYS seems like, whenever something good to me happens, something bad immediately happens afterwards. For example, two years ago my crush at the time - and good friend - gave me a gift for Christmas and it was the second time I was over the moon in the span of a month. That entire year was something else tbh, since she turned out to be not so good anyway, but at the time she seemed so nice that she had no flaws at all. Typical stupid hormones clouding judgement.Also, I got the best news in my life yesterday regarding a chronic illness I’ve had all my life - and since I’m a medical student, I asked on a related subreddit blanket statements on technique, effectiveness, etc, and was removed for being “medical advice” even though it was solely because I was curious about the surgery itself. I know, it probably doesn’t sound super important but this is a reoccurring theme in my life. Little things fuck up my happiness. Ugh. ",0

"F, 24 baliw na (ata).  Di ko alam kung dala ba to ng mga trauma na naexperience ko before kaya nagkaka ganito na ako. I've been cheated multiple times before na pag ba nalaman nyo yung buong kwento e para lang syang pelikula na ginago ng writer.Araw araw kung ano ano yung naiisip ko kapag mag isa ako. Dati ko na ring tinangkang magpakamatay at sige ang laslas ko kapag wala sa lugar yung mga naiisip ko. I always felt lonely, always felt that I wasn't enough,  always felt that I will never be enough. Kung titingnan yung buhay ko without knowing all my thoughts, sobrang regular lang nya. Pero putangina, may mga oras talaga na hindi ko kayang pigilin yung sarili ko na para bang punong puno na ako at gusto na sumabog nalang. I actually have a partner, nearly a year na. He's very kengkoy or kung iisipin sya yung joker ng grupo o barkadahan, ako naman sakto lang. Masaya lang kami haha, since the beginning wala pa talaga kaming nagiging pagtatalo. Kung meron man yung mga minor lang like 2 mins okay na kami agad. Pero kahit anong saya ko sa kanya o kahit anong saya namin sa isat isa, nababaliw na talaga ako. Meron paring sad spot na natitira sa buhay ko, sa puso ko. Nakakalungkot lang kase di rin ako makapag share ng nararamdaman ko sa kanya kase feeling ko di sya interesado. Minsan din kase nangyari na pinangaralan nya ako o pinagsabihan lang nung nag express ako sa kanya ng thoughts ko. I do felt na nainvalidate talaga yung feelings ko kaya siguro nawalqn na rin ako ng lakas ng loob na magsabi sa kanya. Ngayon naiisip ko nalang na pagod na pagod na ko sa buhay ko. Na para saan rin ba to e wala naman akong maabot abot. Halo halo na sila e. I actually want to tell more kaso pagod na ako. I'm barely holding on and feels like malapit ko nang putulin yung thread na kinakapitan ko. I'm so fvcking sick and tired of my life. ",0
"I really need some sort of help distinguishing between if I actually need medication or just therapy. Or any advice...anything.How can you draw the line between feelings caused by yourself or by an actual issue in your brain? I feel like my issues are caused by myself, as in I perpetuate this horrible feelings. Maybe I sit around too much, maybe I don't do enough. I don't know anymore.The events and thoughts that trigger these hour+ episodes feel situational, but I've tried to shake them away to no avail. When I think about how I'm lonely, misunderstood, outcasted etc., it sends me spiraling (stuff like that). I've tried making friends and putting myself out there to maybe make some connections, but it's only been making me feel worse. Basically, it's been getting increasingly harder to cope with these growing feelings of anxietyand depression.Soon, I'll be going back up to school and need to make a decision before it's too late, and nobody obviously knows who the hell I am. Medicine seems to be overprescribed and seen as the quick fix. The other issue: I don't have time for therapy. It's been *hell* trying to get appointments in, so I'm left to wonder what I can even do at this point.If someone has gone through this, please give me some sort of pointers. I feel like I'm blaming myself too much, or maybe that I'm giving myself too much benefit of the doubt, that these emotions are not my fault.",0
"I 28f was extremely suicidal as a teen. I never did it obviously and always used how my mom would react along with the possibility of a future as my reason. This is literally my first time on reddit because I need to get this out. Even though I was using my possible future as my reason I honestly never planned or expected to make it this far. I've been living my life just coping with the fact that I'm alive but now I honestly don't know what to do. I've been in therapy for years and I still don't want to die, I just struggle with the fact that I'm alive sometimes. It's like my future is here but I'm at the same place I was as a teen. Honestly I don't know where to go from here. I keep moving forward with school and therapy because that's what your supposed to do. I disassociate all the time and constantly switch between feeling nothing and everything all at once which triggers the nothing. For context I was in a mentally and emotionally abusive relationship for 5 years and have been diagnosed with ptsd, depression, anxiety and pmdd (which is like pms on steroids and makes the depression worse when it hits)Like I said I don't want to die I just honestly didn't expect to make it this far and now I'm kind of at a loss.

"Well my fellow broken friends, we know our depression warps our view of the world and ourselves so my main support my mom would remind me of the things I know to be true. I asked her to do this if she didn’t mind. Well today when I went to her she told me she wishes I never went to her because “I like to annoy her” among a couple other things I don’t wish to share. She called me “asshole” when I told her some of things she’s saying is affecting our trust. Then she gaslights me over my reaction after I leave saying “sorry I can’t do enough for you, and sorry you don’t trust me”. Anyways she was awesome till that, I’m not risking hearing those things again. and I’m still looking for a GOOD therapist I can (somewhat) connect with. I need someone, maybe this is my sign to go back to God. Maybe theres literally no human in my personal life that will be there for me. ",0
"Hi reddit, I'm 17 F and my depression and anxiety has spiked, it's becoming really hard to just go about normal life. It's summer break rn and no one is ever home anymore and when they are it's them talking amongst themselves about stuff I don't understand or they don't want me to hear. I know I have no reason to have these issues, and I'm just being childish for it but at this rate I don't know how I'm going to keep going. My mom has stopped talking to me unless it's to tell me to do something or that I did something wrong. She took my little brother 13 m and his friend fishing 2 days ago (my little brother ""lives"" at my step grandmas), and yesterday she spent it with my older brother 18 m and today she's with my older brother again. My stepdad is never home because of the work he does. I just sit in the house with the dog and cats. I only got my dog because after my 2 brothers both got a cat and dog, I freaked out because ""it wasn't fair"" and we got the keep the last puppy for me but they all hate him because he's dumb and was the rut so he isn't all there (the 10th puppy) in the end I keep having to see him get yelled at and hatted because I couldn't just be greatful that my brothers got all that. I don't what to do I just want to feel normal and not be an outcast in my own family. But I think other family members are starting to notice because they keep trying to invite me to stuff but my mom never makes it a priority so I never get to go. (I can't drive). Maybe I'm the problem because I can't do anything right and keep just failing at making Mom feel like I'm someone who deserves her love and I know I don't always treat her right but I don't know what to do. I get mad that the only time she talks to me is to tell me to do something but I don't know how to tell her that. I'm sorry to anyone who read through this I just need somewhere to rant ",0
"If nobody around me cares or even if the do, if I feel like they don’t care what’s the point. Won’t people move on after a while so I might as well just disappear. Like even people on Reddit will move on after a few hours so what does it matter?",0
"i only have online friends, i have no social interaction in real life other than with my mother. my mother has had cancer for 6 years and has gotten cancer again recently and theres no cure for her. i always worry that i’m going to lose the only person i have. everybody that used to be friends with me is living a seemingly good life, they’re going away to college and constantly hanging out with friends and i’m still secluded in my room running twitter fan accounts at the age of 18 because i have nothing better to do with my time. it makes me sad because they used to be the way i am but everybody grew out of this phase and i never did. i am a genuine loser and i don’t even know what to do about it. i cant bring myself to even try and make friends, and feel im undeserving with my aggressive and horrible attitude. which, once again, only makes me feel worse because i do it to myself and don’t change.

"Basically Im writing this so I can get an opinion about how I've feeling since childhood. I never had the money to go to a therapist of any kind but I just want to get this over with and start by identifying what it is.I come from an extremely abusive family with a narc father that prayed upon my mother when she was a teenager and thats how I basically came about. During my childhood I have witnessed many fights, physical and verbal that have left me with terrible overthinking and anxiety to the point of not being able to speak in school or any other places. Ever since I was little I have known that there was something very wrong happening within my family and life but I didnt manage to see the extent untill I became a teen. Besides this, as a lesbian, I grew up being a more masculine girl and I really liked wearing boys clothes, cutting my hair short and stuff like that, all of which my father berrated me for. Calling me insane, ugly and stupid, while I was between the ages of 7 to 13.When I was 16 my mother thankfully left my father and took me with her, we had to get a restraining order, but he still messaged us and followed us on the street. During this time my mother got with one of her coworkers that she had known for some time. At the start it was ok, but he and my mother got into very intense fights from time to time which only reminded me of our previous life. I also want to mention that ever since I can remember I just can not find it me to trust or befriend men, let alone live peacefully in the same house with one.Eventually my mom, stepdad and I moved toghether in an apartment and from then on their fights only got worse. Stuff about cheating, who does what chores and whatnot. After some time this guy started complaining to my mom about every single piece of dust in the house that bothered him, including me leaving my coat on the hanger beside the door when I got home and other insignificant crap like that. There was one particularly bad fight that led him to brake like half of the plates in the house and another time where they were yelling so loud that the police car patroling the area heard them from the street and came up to ask what was happening to them. I had to live like this with them for about a year of constant fighting and breaking things, before I got so fed up by them that I flat out told that asshole if he broke one more thing of my mothers I would drag him out and leave him out for the whole night. Apparently he got extremely ""depressed"" by what I told him and my mother said he feels like this is not his home anymore. Like I would give a shit after all the stuff I had to hear from him for a whole year.My mother said that she would find me a place to stay and that she would cover the rent as long as I cover the bills with what I get from my part time job while I also go to uni. I agreed, Ive been wanting to live on my own for quite some time, unfortunately living with other people never went that well for me. Ive never known a house of peace and quiet untill I finally moved by myself.I explained all of this to give some context of why I am felling so unmotivated and down all of the time, all of this plus the bullying from middleschool, my terrible highschool experience in the pandemic coupled with my parents messed up break up, threats from my father, constant fighting all around, lack of meaningfull friendships and experiences, all of these have led me to where I am now. Even tho things are better I still cant shake this feeling of mental tiredness and lack of motivation to grow in any way. My only meaningfull relationship now is with my long distance girlfriend who I dont get to see as often as we would like, and my mother.I have the feeling that all of these things that happened to me and my mom have soured our relationship and its not as good as it once was, but everytime I try to talk to her about this she either says its my fault or tells me that Im imagining things.I have considered suicide from as early as 11 years old, pretty much only imagining how and when I would do it, but never actually made a solid plan to follow. Its been like am anchor for me, anytime things got really bad I would think about it and it almost brought me comfort sometimes. By the time mom broke up with my father I have stopped wanting to do it eventually, but the feeling remains. I dont have the energy to do things I wish I could, I dont have the energy to socialise, the school Im going to doesnt interest me at all, my part time job that I got is ok I guess but thats pretty much all that I feel like Im able do to. The rest of my time is spent playing videogames, drawing sometimes, cleaning my studio and thats about it. I remember being 10 years old and staring up at the ceiling, thinking about all the mean things kids at school would tell me sometimes, then telling myself that one day all will be better and I would feel good. Almost 10 years later now and I still cant shake that same feeling from all that time ago, and I dont know what to do anymore. If anybody has advice I would be thankfull to hear it, or if you have a better subreddit I should post this to please let me know.Thank you for everybody that read everything ",0
"My family is dead/Dying. My dad is dead. My mom is insane and homeless. My sister is a drug addict has been for years she’s almost 30 :/ she’s been one since 17 so…She’s dead too.My lineage is gone, all distant cousins won’t speak or even help. My family cut ties with them cus they literally did not care about us. We were always the black sheep of the lineage because we were most successful(?)

I’m mentally somethings up cus I can’t do math, and can’t do certain normal things other people do. I’m just a quirk. I’ve got ptsd and extreme paranoia from abuse and distrust. I never developed a social life, was always playing video games. And now I can’t physically talk to people because I can’t perceive how to talk to them. I’m messed up. And i haven’t applied for disability. I know I must because I feel people will hurt me at work for doing things wrong or I’ll get hurt in public or stabbed/ black mailed you name it. It’s physically awful cus I can’t literally focus or look at people. I feel like The Truman show but everyone wants to hurt me. The thing is. My grandfathers dying of cancer. I’ve never had a job due to my paranoia, and it’s physically impossible for me to work due to my fear. I will be homeless I’m sure. But I’m alone soon. All alone the thing I’ve feared worst of all through my whole life coming true. And I missed the chance for everything and now am 22 nothing I have is worth living for after him.

"I'm 20F and I've always been a very sad person. I don't remember ever being happy in life. I wasn't even happy as a child. My social skills are poor and I barely have friends, even at that age. It's so easy to make friends at that age. I did only have one best friend who always stuck with me for the majority of my childhood (5-10). We parted ways after this so we were apart for many years and we don't talk that much anymore. I don't like my family either. I wish I had a different family. My mum is so mean and she's always been. She yells at me, gets annoyed and complains about the littlest things. My depression gets worse when I come home from university too. I hate being at home for the summer. She still treats us like children and is so restrictive 😭 Many times in my life I begged for God to kill me because I hate living so much. I realised I hate living since I was 13. I'm in emotional pain every day and I just want it to be my end. I can't stand life anymore. Idk why I'm still here. I don't have the courage to end it all. I'm such an idiot. Death is my answer and the only way I'll be satisfied.",0
"Had enough. Not like suicidal. People and myself. I’ve had enough. Can’t make anyone happy. Can’t make myself happy. I’ve had enough.

Just fucked up like others but like to feel above others meaning I’m insecure and pathetic. Can’t stand this existence. Other people would think I’m successful with a decent career but women don’t think that about me. It seems I should’ve became a cop, firefighter or paramedic and cheated on whoever with another nurse. I hate this place. Moving doesn’t solve shit I know this already. Made it better but still desiring to not be so miserable after 13yrs of chronic depression. I’m not expecting anyone to read this. If I saw a post like this I’d keep scrolling lol. I’m old, irrelevant and out of touch. What a weird existence ",0
"SA warning17m, diagnosed with social anxiety also feeling very depressed these days, it's affecting my studies and basically everything I used to enjoy once has now been a thing in the past.I come from a very toxic family and been abused from as long as I can remember it's still on,back than due to a light infection which my parents neglected and judged me for it which later on grew and affected me really badly and pulled me down everyway I have been inside my home from than although I have recovered from it but that trauma still lives on with me,we later changed cities and cuz of how anti social I became I was extremely bullied in my school which led to the droppage of my grades which in turn led to more family abuse,I also wanna study and get better grades but just doing it hurts since my family loves to leave remarks and judge me for anything regardless of what I do,so fast forward I have been in extreme depression for 6 years now,In my final year of hs no friends,I also don't have any money to afford anything so therapy is out of the question, all my old friends are gone and I just feel so lonely,and basically I'm still stuck in the past.No matter how hard I try I think I'll forever be lonely now,even my last of friends ended it on a bad note saying that I was extemped as a bully shuttle for some time just because my dad died recently and that I am pathetic.I have trust issues too since I have been scammed by my ex friends  a few times and also SA at school.I feel like everyone I meet is a jerk or it's just that I don't deserve to fit in anywhere like everyone says to me",0

I have been taking it correctly,every single day.I have been drinking alcohol for the past 2 weeks tho,could it have interfered with anything and I’m just now feeling the effects?…",0
"Perhaps because I've been hated so much, I can easily sense when someone's actions towards me are off. I think a part of me has become more sensitive after going through so much. But another part of me believes it’s right.People often say not to stay close to those who are hated, as you might understand why they are despised. Looking around, I see many people who hate me. So, I don't bother building new relationships; I become quieter and more withdrawn.Because I'm hated, after every meeting, after every conversation, I spend months analyzing if I said something wrong or behaved poorly. I know that sometimes, people hate me because, at times, I'm also the bad guy.Since I'm hated, I just hope that if everyone hates me, they will just say it and leave. Don't linger in my life, making me disappointed, comparing me, treating me badly. If they hate me, they should just leave. Don't stay and hurt me until I have to be the one to leave first. Don't torment me to make my life even more miserable.Today, I read this quote from someone’s post: ""I have enough sadness already."" I realized, I also have enough sadness. I don't need anyone to hurt me more because I have enough sadness to last a lifetime. I have many wounds from ten years ago still waiting to heal. So, if you hate me, leave me, IMMEDIATELY. The end!",0

"I've been working as a content writer for the last decade and freelancing since 2020. I loved my job. It was enough to provide me with a decent lifestyle until our country experienced a civil war and I had to relocate to a neighbouring country. Since my profession requires the understanding of the language of the country I'm in now, my career is stunted. Many of my friends in marketing, hospitality and nursing found jobs abroad easily while I have to rely on my parents' support to get by in a foreign country. I'm 31 now. I feel worthless. It's very hard to leave a decade-long career and start from scratch by learning a new language while my friends seamlessly continue theirs.

Arguments and misunderstandings are normal but sometimes I can’t get a hold of it. I tend to rage out of nowhere and easily get triggered by things I was familiar with.

Years ago during Covid when I was really depressed/anxious I was having leg weakness, but it was subjective… I could still exercise and stuff, but they were constantly feeling heavy and weak.

"I hate how much i hate my mom but she's a fucking narcissistic lunatic bitch. The silent treatment she gives me is driving me insane, I'm constantly harming myself for her attention. My dads a fucking porn addicted loser, he did nothing his own life, sat at home with the comfort of what my mother provided to the family. Neither can he defend me when the abuse takes place nor does he give a shit about me. He can't even strike a conversation with me, he only talks about himself. He's so immature, so childish, it's disgusting. My mom's very hardworking, she did everything she could to raise me, she even rented her jewels just to pay for my school. But the abuse is too much. I've been strangled, constant beatings, slaps punches, cutting me what not. This isn't it even it, the abuse was mostly emotional. After I talk to her, I'm constantly left doubting if my reality is real, it's like i remember everything wrong. She denies anything she has ever said to me. It's so crazy, I can't figure out whether she wants me to live or not. Whenever I try to end it, she comes crying, begging me to live, and if I die my dad will probably end it too. But sometimes she randomly tells me to end it, and that my family would be better off, thriving, without me. It's been 3 years since I've been depressed. The only reason why I've been trying to live is because I don't want my parents to be sad. I did try many times, I also od'ed, she acted kindly for a few days but hell broke lose after that. The abuse is so much. It's torture. I feel like I'm in hell. I can't bear hearing anymore of her bullshit. It genuinely hurts so much. The times when I had no hopes to live is returning. I don't care about the pain anymore. Living is more painful than anything. I don't want to be an annoyance to my mother anymore, I'm sick of being a burden. But I want to hear her cry and scream after she finds me hanging. I want my revenge. I want her to feel bad about me being dead. I want her to blame herself for everything she did to me. But at the same time I don't want this to happen to her. It's not her fault, it's my fault for being the worst daughter ever alive. But again if I die, she'll again probably forget in a month or so. I have no friends either. Nobody's going to miss me. So it's reasonably better for me to die. I don't know anymore. I'm confused. ",0

"I am a 18 years old girl. Will be 19 in next month. So here's my story -My father never cared about me and my mother so we live in my grandpa's house. 2 years ago my mother left me because of some other men. She emotionally manipulated me to accept the relationship. I can't , it's not because I don't want her to marry anyone. It's because he is a bad guy and she is still married with my father. She blamed everyone (my uncle , my grandma and grandpa) for wasting her life. But there's no fault of them. They told her to divorce my father when I was merely 1 or 2 years old. But she didn't because of me.On the other hand , the family I am living with they always forbid me to talk to everyone , go anywhere since my childhood. I didn't even allowed to go 1km away from my house to buy something when I was 14-15. Because of that social anxiety grew in me. And now suddenly they are pushing me to went out and talk to everyone. But why they don't understand that because of them only I am scared of people. But now they keep denying it. When I used to talk to people and go out with my friends with just 500 meters away from my house , my mother used to beat me so much. And I went there with my family's permission , but then also she did that. And not even once , she did it severe times.I used to have friends but they all left me and some friendship broke because I changed my school. In my new school , all girls were mean to me. When they needed something they all pampering me like I was their best friend but when their work was done they were like I didn't even exist. I changed that school also for some reasons ( I took science stream because I loved that but for the things my mother did with me I was in trauma so I couldn't go forward with the stream so I changed my stream and took admission in another school) , now I am studying in an open school.I wanted to become a film director , but my uncle and other relatives forbid me to do that. It's ok I understand their concern. Because that industry is not easy for any middle class people. But it was my childhood dream. Now I figured out that apart from that I love psychology also and I can become a psychologist. It took me 2 years to figure it out and few weeks ago I told it to my uncle. I thought he would be proud that I want to do that but he deny that also. He said I am taking decisions emotionally and I can't make money from that career and I should choose another one. Now I don't know what to do , every career I chose they rejected. I have no hope left now.I made some online friends also during lockdown. They also left me. Few months ago also I made some friends but when I saw they gave all of our time to others I started distancing myself from them also because I can clearly say by their behavior that I was only for timepass. So I broke those friendships because I am afraid to feel that pain again , the pain when someone's heart broke. I am tired of it. But I trusted my one friend , I had many thoughts that how I will wish her on Friendship Day , but look at my fate , before friendship day comes she also left me.Now I become a person who forgot how real smile feels like. You can say I smile all the time but not the real one. Now from past few days I can't even smile , I feel like staying alone all the time. I forgot how best friends feels like. I have exams 1 month later but I can't study a single word. Whenever I started studying my brain feels tired , I don't know what to do. I feel hopeless. I feel like I am not worthy to anything , I feel like I should be punished everytime. I used to love painting , singing , studying. These were my life but I stop loving these also. I don't found peace in anything like these which I used to do all the time.Everytime I tried to talk with my uncle (he is raising me now because my mother left the house) about my anxiety and depression , he made me feel like that I am mistaking it as depression it's not that and I am a kid I don't know about it. Now I feel like I am the one who destroyed the family. If I didn't took birth everyone would be happy. My mother didn't marry that time because of me , she could marry if I hadn't been born. My uncle didn't marry anyone because of me , if I hadn't been born then he would have been happy with his wife and children. And my grandpa and grandma doesn't deserve a granddaughter like me. If my uncle and mother got married with their partners , they would have their children who would have been best. Not a girl like me.My all friends doing best in their lives and here I am. 3 years of my life already wasted for the trauma. And now this point I am consumed by the darkness more from which I was trying to come out from 3 years. And this time it's too much , I am tired of everything and I don't even have anyone to talk with about these.",0

Ok fine whatever, even though I’m usually the only one that gives her a shower.She starts crying and I come in asking what’s wrong but instead, he pushes the door on me, trying to keep me out. I pushed back hard, I think he wasn’t expecting it, and I tried grabbing her but he started pushing me out the door so I started punching him and once he finally let go of her (she wasn’t anywhere near my punches he was completely blocking her from me) I grabbed her and investigated…He got soap in her eye and wasn’t washing it off, probably thought she was being a sucky baby… I didn’t know what was going on he doesn’t communicate with me properly.2nd time, he broke my cousins tv, punched a whole in my wall, and called my grandpa stupid when he told my bf he has bad anger problems, I was already reaching my breaking point with him especially since I was pregnant that time and had a one year old, he stole my wifi box during an argument because I wouldn’t let him drink, which he has a problem with.So I put my baby in her crib and chased him and fought him because without it, I can’t phone/talk to my family, my only support.3rd time, he stole from me again and called me a dumb bitch because I got mad at him and told him to go, I called him a bitch back and he went rushing to my room (he had everything of his) so my thought was he wanted to steal, I chased him again and he started pushing my arm away which hurt a lot because I’ve broken them before and instead of being submissive, I got angry and fought him for hurting me.I have anger problems, I came from an abusive mother, to abusive foster home, to abusive relationship so I thought he’d be more understanding with how I deal with threats.The thing is, he tells people I hit him and the kids, and it’s randomly, unprovoked, and says I’m abusive and mean out loud like he wants everyone to hear.He phones people mid argument (no physical alterations) and sobs while telling them I beat him up, and if they say leave or ask if he’s on drugs, he gets mad at them and tries to be good with me.He doesn’t work (mental health problems) and leaves me home all day and does the bare minimum when he comes home and even makes a mess when I just finished cleaning, I’m exhausted and distraught that I’m in a relationship where I feel so threatened all the time and I’m abusive, I don’t like hitting him, I know it’s wrong, and even sometimes I wish he’d hit me back… I’m depressed and hate that he’s my partner and hate the way I am. My babies deserve better but I wanna be better, it’s just I have no support at all…",0
I don’t feel good I think I got too high and drank and I know my partner doesn’t like me and probably wants me dead tbh. Idk what to do and I feel really paranoid and waiting for her is making me panic! ,0
Hello I'm a college student from Bangalore. I'm currently in 6th semester engineering. From 2nd semester to till now I've never took a single rupee from my parents for my living and expenses. I was working and earning through part time and some other small businesses. 5 months back I've fell into a casino trap and lost all my money. Even now I didn't ask my parents for financial aid to living in this city( I come from a small town). I stopped playing that sin casino that day. But now it has come on my neck. Till now I have survived. But I can't manage it anymore. The money I lent 5 months back has to be paid. My parents doesn't know that I fell into casino trap and i can't tell them about this as they would breakdown. My placements are nearing and exams as well. I've lost in the game of life and wouldn't be able to make my parents happy and proud. I'm lost. Should I live?I wish God give me one chance to come out of this mess and concentrate on my career and family. ,0
Used to be upset how far behind I am with my peers in university graduation.  Not going to let negativity energy to get to me.  Instead I’m going to focus on my journey. Everyone journey is always different. Hopefully I could inspire others that who struggles with depression,0
"im not sure how to explain this but ill do my best. i feel like i dont want to get better. i thought i wanted to get better but the small part of my brain that wants to get better is practically gone. i want to get as bad as possible. as sick as possible. i want everyone to realize, but when people actually ask about it or notice i panic and use my usual excuse. (i say that im just tired, which jm technically not lying because i am tired of life.) ",0
"I hate how nowdays there are many of us who feel this way. Reading many posts here I realised that there are too many of us who are just tired of our jobs, lack of friendships, goals,motivation.I (23m) am tired of working dead end job and making someone else rich, having not so best circumstances as some other people my age.I lack friendships,I lack human connection. I have no girlfriend. I have hobbies but they are surely going to Boring town.I know I want to live and Im grateful for having chance but Im worried for future. ",0
"I went to see my primary doctor today after she referred me to a therapist, and I have been seeing the therapist. But I went today because my headache, leg ache, and neck ache are all too much. I told her everything, and she said, unfortunately, everything I am experiencing is tied back to my mental health, and the only way I can get better is if my mental health improves. When she said that, I wanted to cry because I know my mental health will never get better so I have to live with these extreme body fatigue. I have been dealing with depression since I was 11, and I am almost 23 now, and over the years, it has only gotten worse. I have tried so many times to get better, but the traumatic events that keep happening to me are unbearable. I can't believe I have to live like this; my heart breaks for me. I told my mom, ""See, you told me to see the doctor, but every doctor keeps saying the same thing.’’ I don’t even know who I am suppose to blame for my suffering. It hurts because people expect me to do regular human chores but I am physically not capable of doing anything I am literally mentally and physically sick. I can’t rest for even five minutes. ",0
"I think one of the worst parts of my self hatred is knowing I'm making things worse yet not stopping it out of distrust of my own mind. I stress eat and before even getting the food know it's stress eating bad food yet don't stop it. Sometimes I avoid the things that may improve my mood, or knowingly lie to people for shitty reasons. I need to take meds yet just sit or lay down while actively thinking about them. Self sabotage is about the only skill I have and at this rate even if I don't kill myself one day my horrible decisions will do it for me. I know all of this yet don't do anything but worsen it and thus worsen my self hatred. It'd have been so much simpler if an accident had happened way back before all this I swear.",0
I’m really lonely right now and just need someone to talk to. I’m really social but my friends are all too busy with life so I don’t have people to talk to much. Thank you,0
"I tried all those pills and only non stimulant adhd meds have helped me slightly. I feel so empty without any substance. I was sober from 18-21 and it was the worst time of my life. I need weed or to drink a few times a week. It's the only love I have. Nobody besides the bar flies will talk to me and I have worn my presence on them. I'm truly a crap sack. I don't deserve pity, but maybe I can relate with others. Never hurt anybody however. Never made anybody cry either besides my parents and some crazy exs. I've just created a lot of animosity and drugs are my only friends that stick around. I'm not off the deep in yet. I keep myself in check, but it's not a good place to be either. If only a girl could save me like just is the answer. Sinning is all there is to this world. Sorry jesus",0
"I've been depressed for a long time. For the past 16 years, I had no friends, little interaction with family, worked very little, no relationships, no hobbies, no travel, no exercise/sports etc etc, the usual stuff. The main reason for all that is my inherent desire to escape suffering. Obviously since I'm depressed, I have zero motivation to do anything. And anytime I start doing things, my anxiety kicks in really bad. So in order to escape from the active suffering, I've lived like a hermit, on the very little money that I manage to save after doing some work. I barely do anything everyday, even stuff that I used to enjoy.But recently, I've decided I will actively start doing the things I hate that nevertheless allows me to pretend I'm human. I will take the advanced courses that I need for my career to progress. I will start exercising for 1-2 hours every single day. I will start forcing myself to interact more with people. I will try to make friends and start relationships. I will start engaging in hobbies and sports. I will put a lot of effort in getting a better job and actually keeping them.All of these are things that I hate beyond words. All of them give me intense fear and disgust. But I've essentially given up on finding a solution to my problems. I've accepted that my illness will never end. But I will emulate being human anyway, because the one duty I feel I have is to make my family and friends happy. They are all very sad at my condition, but I don't want them to suffer because of me. I'm also doing this out of spite towards my body and mind. I hate both of them, I curse them for what they've become. So I will make them suffer like they made me suffer.  And if the suffering becomes too much for me that I do the unthinkable, then so be it. But no more of this half-existence where I neither enjoy nor suffer. ",0

It was already my mom’s birthday and my sisters, and the rest of my familys. I want to see my baby cousin turn 8 and my aunt turn 50. I want to see my best friend be 14. I want to see her happy. But im not sure i can make it past December. Im glad my birthday is at the end if year, its like a wish to just see everybody else’s life, and the last day, i can just pass. My grandmas already dead, atleast i can meet her right? I mean, i have no hope anymore. My life, theres things, i cant explain. That i don’t understand in my brain. How do i even get help, when i can’t explain something that I dont even know. Do you know how gut wrenching that is? How gut wrenching it feels to realize that i probably wont get better.

"You never think about depression being physically exhaustinv, i never thought it'dmake me physical tired constantly and leave me needing more sleep. Going from someone that was well rested on 4hrs a night to needing 6 or 7, with naps during the day. At this point im just deteriorating. ",0
"I hate having a body, I despise almost every one of its functions. I hate almost all physical sensations, even the pleasant ones are overshadowed by how limited I feel by having a body. I feel perpetually cramped by just existing. I hate eating, drinking, shitting, pissing, breathing, hearing my blood pump when it's quiet, hearing my heart beat. It's all so disgusting to me, how could anyone like any of this? I often feel very detached from my body due to how much I wish I wasn't trapped in one. There is almost no sensations that I enjoy so it is extremely easy for me to become tired with something physically as I just cannot bring myself to care enough. I eat less, drink less. My body doesn't even really tell me when I'm hungry anymore I am just hit with sudden waves of fatigue and think ""oh I must not have eaten or drank in a while. Now I have to."" I despise it. I feel like nothing in this world was meant for me. How do all of you feel about having a body? For those of you who enjoy having a body, what do you enjoy about it? ",0
"I feel I need a break from social media. A little backstory: I have PTSD (from sexual trauma). I would go on social media. I’m very psychically isolated, meaning I don’t go out much due to disability. So I spend most days in my room, which I struggle with depression. So I wouldn’t want to go out anywhere. And generally, I’m happy. I guess with that, sometimes it’s torture, but sometimes I choose voluntarily to do it. My friends are busy. They have jobs. And I start college soon. But yet I feel alone and isolated (by my own choices and my own doing because of multiple reasons). So I’d spend a lot of time on social media. And I hear stories and stuff that’s bad, but it’s my only form of engagement and “community.” I’ve always been an  isolating person, to where I would choose to stay in my own bubble and then in-engage in person.  I was always like this, but my main problem is that I would see all these stories and I can’t delete the app because my friends would use them or I’d feel I’m missing out on something. I do have a therapist. I’m trying to work through this with them.",0
"I apologize if this is messy and stuff this is a throw away account because I just need a place to rant/vent.Im turning 18 soon and I don’t want to live anymore due to so much emotional abuse from my own parents, mainly my mother. She’s traditional which I understand however this doesn’t excuse her telling me that she’s going to take me somewhere so my brain is checked since there’s something wrong with me. I know I’m not perfect yet me being who I am shouldn’t be an excuse and not wanting to be like her. I’ve heard this for years but it’s so hurting to hear her say these words to me. Recently my tia is supposed to arrive from another state around my birthday which I don’t mind but they’re forcing a party for not only her but also for me, and I hate parties even mini ones. My parents said it wasn’t a party for me however they told me to pick a cake for myself, and to accept any gifts even if I hated it. I understand we have to be respectful but I have different interests and I hate accepting gifts I hate because I know I will never use them. I started to cry alone in my room and my mother gets mad at since crying is only for children and not “young ladies.” She leaves my room but later she comes back to my room and she lays down next to me as I’m trying to stop crying snd telling me that, my father is going to be much anger and yell at me for crying. I know this seems petty but I’ve dealt with this emotional manipulation for years and this is just one out of many moments that made me feel like I was nothing to them but an accessory to a happy family and a doll for my mother to control. I’m so tired of this endless loop of us getting into arguments and my mother emotionally abusing me so I can’t say no because I know I’m crazy with my intrusive thoughts and just want this to stop because it gets us nowhere. I’m never going to change for her and she’s always going yo make me feel like nothing. I want to sleep forever yet I’m so terrified of death, I’m so tired of fighting.I apologize if I repeat things and sound bratty, I’m not good with words or actions.",0
"I’ve had a rough year, all due to my own actions in a single episode. Nearly a year ago I got drunk during a manic episode and cheated on a partner (someone who was amazing) and it shifted my life completely. I was the funny stoner nerd then and after that night I turned into a depressed loser. Weed really helped me but after that night I’ll smoke and just have panic attacks about how wrong I was. I went sober for a bit but couldn’t stay with it due to not being able to deal with my emotions/not due able to smoke weed. I started smoking cigs b/c of it and tbh while I hate I smoke them I can’t stop. I‘ve fallen into a deep depression, deepest I’ve ever felt. I lost multiple jobs, lost my passions and lost myself. I was in a bad living situation where I had a roommate who didn’t pay rent and owes me nearly 10K at this point. Because of this I was almost evicted but do well at my main job where I paid their back rent to keep my place til lease ended. I now live in a pretty crappy apartment with two friends and it’s made me so depressed b/c my place before was amazing. A few weeks ago due to how I felt I lost that same partner that was kind enough to forgive me for what I did. I know it’s my fault and that one night that lead to all these issues. Since then I’ve turned heavily into alcohol. I think of killing myself nearly every day. The last few nights I’ve done and bought lots of coke and realized tonight if I don’t change right now I will either die or live a life I hate even more. I’m just so lost - I’m going to AA on Monday and am scared I’m not strong enough to stay sober without the crouch of weed and a kid. That isn’t so filled with guilt. I genuinely had such a bright future and it’s hard to think I messed it all up in one singular night. I don’t know what I’m looking for but I feel so alone and just wanted to post this. Any advice?

"Im not going to sugar coat it… these past weeks have been the worst weeks of my life… To summarize: I’ve been mentally ill these past 8 years and it has gotten worse since I got depression. And I got diagnoses like: anorexia, OCD, depression, social anxiety, sleep deprivation, suicidal thoughts and tendencies, self harm, nonverbal learning disorder and so on. This is because of my low self esteem since childhood and because of bullying. I feel unormal and a burden to this world because of all my illnesses and my low self esteem and confidence. Till today I’ve had enough. I’ve have had fucking enough. I can’t live like this anymore so I dialed 911 and talked to the emergency room as well.I have literally no one in my life. Only my parents and they don’t understand my situation at least not properly.I’ve lost all interest in my hobbies. I don’t care anymore. And now I’m going to a forced psychiatric ward.

"Due to this being a large sub reddit I'm not sure how many people will see this and I don't really care. I just wanted to get this out there. It's exactly what the title says. I am so lost in life right now i don't know where to go. About a month ago me and my ex broke up and it really fucked me up mentally. I've tried to act like I'm ok and doing good but it's just to exhausting. It's at a point where people at work keep asking me if I'm ok and i just say yes because i don't want to burden someone else with my thoughts. I'm just lost. All i do is work and sleep and even sleeping feels like a chore because i don't want to wake up the next day. I wake up and i immediately am filled with sadness, anger, animosity, loneliness, but i feel empty at the same time. I just don't want to live like this anymore. I don't know if i want to live anymore. I am lost.",0
"I feel like every day I'm just going through the motions. I feel so empty and I have to constantly find new hobbies to fill that void. My life is fake I'm fake. I lie constantly. Nothing I do is real. I'm living in make believe because I was born and told I couldn't die. I don't want to die but I find myself sleeping all the time. It's so peaceful. I adore dreaming and creating a fantasy world where I can solve my problems and feel things in my heart. I have a therapist. I have medication. But somehow I'm missing a part of me. It was stolen from me during my childhood. This is where my innocence lies dead. Burred just like the missing part of me. Its been so long that the void has intertwined with who I am. I no longer fear it. I am content with it. Like accepting your dinner is okay but still edible. I have no desire to rip it's roots from me. It has created who I am. No matter how much the void takes away the true depth of happiness I could feel, I will never hate it. I'm glad it lets me feel fleeting laughter and similes before dropping me back into reality. It's like a sudden drop into an ice bath. It's almost instant. My void doesn't even let me embrace the warmth of happiness. It likes to tease me show me what life could be like if I never lost half of me.Have a good night/day! :)",0

"As someone who is trying to learn all about depression and mental disorders (dealing with MDD), I came across a video about psychology that truly made me realize how much men are so underrepresented in aspects of why they commit suicide. About less than half of these cases were not due to mental illness but the fact that their struggle was too unavoidable, simply put their life situation really was that hopeless and they didn’t no any other way to end the pain and suffering (this is what I heard, credibility dependent upon). As a 15yr F, this really saddens me because I do feel like the men in my life are not good at vocalizing these problems to seek support. I wanted to take 5 min and share about this today.

It’ll be fine in a week but right now I don’t want that week to come at least feeling like this I feel justified. But looking back at these moments makes me feel fucking sick.  ",0
It’s just that one thing that went wrong but it ruined me. I’ve fallen into a deep hole of loneliness and despair. That saying “it’s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all” is bs. I miss the person I was before I knew this feeling. It’s all consuming. It’s been so long and I’m thinking now it’ll never get better. Everyday is a chore lately. It’s tiring to exist. Everyone tells me that I should be happy and that I’m doing well in life. But that just makes me feel more pathetic and guilty. That I feel like this when I have things to be happy about. I don’t want to die but I want to sleep forever. ,0

I love her more than anything but this world has broken me, I’m so disgusted in myself and I truly don’t see myself ever living a normal life, I just want to end it all, I can’t help but feel that every day I’m alive I’m just stealing oxygen. I just feel like I’m too much of a pussy to try end it any other way than with a gun, and even with a gun I’m so scared that I’ll somehow manage to fuck that up too and just ruin myself and live being even more embarrassed coz I failed at taking my own life ",0

"Remembering in some time that I am only a worthless waste of a human that no one needs - it hurts for sure, but I am used to pain and okay with it.Nothing new. (And I have no littlest idea why did I just post it here; it is not my habit to share my depression with other people)",0

It hurts. Its been hurting since i was little. I have a family and husband and son and friends. But i have very bad cptsd and i just hate myself so much that i cant allow myself to exist no longer. I just cant not longer. Every morning i wake up i wish i didnt. I hate myself so much. I just dont wanna feel anything ever again. I feel so selfish. But i just cant. ,0
"Yesterday at 9pm, I was listening to that type of music that is relatable. It's kind of Midwestern emo. I was listening to that music because I felt like it and I just wanted to relate to something. I started feeling lonely while listening to it because of overthinking, and since I was talking to this new guy, I was like ""Wait, is he offline?"" So I went to check to see if he was offline since he still didn't reply to me, but he was online, and it made me upset because he left me on read for like 30 minutes, so I felt more lonely. I then ended up relapsing on self-harm since  I started truly loving him and it made me upset that he would leave me on read. I ended up talking to one of my online friends that I barely talk to. I vented to him about what happened, and he genuinely helped me. he gave me advice and affirmations and just helped in general. I later on told the dude I felt upset about what I did, and I got upset with him and he then said he was in the shower and whatnot, but he was online the whole time. We then resolved it somewhat, but I don't really like him that much anymore since he told me to vent to him, and I did; he didn't even help me or anything. I've dealt with guys in the past treating me like shit and all that. I'm tired of boys thinking they're superior to my attachment issues and shit. I'm just too broken to deal with men treating me like that now so that's why I have written some standards to show boys I see dating in the future maybe. I just want a guy to understand what I've gone through and not be dry or lame. I also don't like when guys say they're going to change just to never do so until things have gotten really bad. I just wish waiting for the one wouldn't take so long and that every guy I talk to is like a trial-and-error situation where I talk to a guy for a few weeks and they don't meet my standards so then I just talk to the next until I eventually find the one. In conclusion, I just dislike most men because of my experiences.",0
"Seriously can someone just off me????

"i feel dumb putting this on reddit. anywhere on the internet, really.im a 19 year old trans guy, 20 in 3 days. i've not gone to college, i dont have a car, i dropped out of highschool due to extreme bullying and an abusive home life from my father, and i still live off of my family. every day i live knowing i shouldnt when i provide nothing. im a mass of flesh that people can laugh at when i make funny jokes. every day ive wished the many times i tried to kill myself as a teenager succeeded. even when i have a boyfriend, friends, and family that i at least think loves me. sometimes im not sure about the last part though. ive lost most of the family that gave a shit about me growing up.i grew up enduring trauma every day, and i use the pit it put me in as an excuse for my shitty behavior. i dont hurt anyone. at least i havent since i was a stupid child that didnt know how to cope with it all. all i know i have correct are my morals. i avoid hurting my close ones, as its all i have to do other than rot away sitting at a computer playing games. but i do nothing else. i cant even clean right, so im scared to. every time ive tried i did something wrong. ive always done something wrong. i managed to set off a house alarm by just trying to take out the trash to prove i was useful.i only havent attempted suicide again so i dont hurt my close ones anymore. but every day it gets really hard. i dont want to be 20 and i dread my birthday, because ive only spent every birthday with 3 people. one is dead, another doesnt talk to me much at all, and the other is in another country entirely for my birthday. i may not be alone because ill have one person, but all of the people that were ever there for me are gone. i feel awful knowing how different it will be. christmas of 2023 i at least had 2 but the one who died was missing and it wrecked me. i dont want to experience all 3 being not there. i dont want to be even older. i had to try really hard to not be at the house i normally stay at just so i wont try to hurt myself before i even get there. i dont want anyone to have to mourn someone like me. i wish they didnt care sometimes.its easy to see what i do have and take it as ""youre lucky you have that at least"" and thats true. ive actually only had this recently. growing up, all of my friends turned out to hate me, before making awful rumors about terrible things i didnt do. or growing a strong distaste for my depression and paranoia and outbursts, which i dont blame them for. i hate it too. most of my family had issues and were never there if they didnt instead hurt me. everything i have has only been here for less than a year. im not used to feeling kindness yet. and i hate it. i want to reciprocate it, but when they say the smallest ""i love you friend"", i feel genuinely only fear because i know in the end they'll most likely leave me with some form of hatred. they always do.i try to fix it. i want to be better. but every time i try i get knocked back down and i fall back into my pit of ""id rather be dead than happy"". its a way i get like 90% of the time. my hope only comes in short bursts.i love my boyfriend, my mom and my friends. i miss my cat and my grandmother. i miss people that hurt me, just because i want to feel less alone. i miss so much. im trying to live in the present and love who i have now. i wish it wasnt so hard. i wish i didnt feel like i may strip away myself from them one day just because of a passing impulse. ive called so many suicide hotlines and been to 3 hospitals. ive been to therapy, and on meds. i know the only solution is myself. i hate myself. i hate myself too much to do anything for myself. if i had a clone of me standing before me and a knife in hand, i dont think id hesitate to hurt it for everything we've gone through.its worse because theres no hope for me attractively either. the fact my boyfriend constantly says ""looks dont matter to me"" should tell you enough. im ugly, fat, have bad posture, and ridiculously out of shape. ive got nothing going for me other than the fact i hurt myself just to give to people. im nothing. a freak that shouldnt be alive. i shouldve died a long time ago.stupid to put this on reddit, i know. im just tired of annoying my friends with my dumb thoughts and issues. i dont really care about trolls or distasteful comments anymore. my biggest hater will always be myself. ive never heard an insult that was worse than what ive called myself. and ive gotten a lot of insults.",0
"I genuinely think there’s no reason to live.When I was a kid the love from my family made me want to live and I was so happy, but then when I became a tween I realized the importance of school friends, and when I realized I didn’t have a friend group to have sleepovers with or just a group of ppl that liked me, I wanted to kill myself. But then I met my friend group after switching schools in 10th grade and I was in euphoria for 3 years. That’s gone now, Ive been graduated for 2 years now and i still have all my friends but now i don’t care about them like i used to because i want a girlfriend. But I honestly just feel like once i get a girlfriend I’ll probably be happy again a few years, but it’ll definitely just fade away again just like my family and my friends.At this point it’s about genuinely seeing no reason to continue forward when nothing mentally stimulating ever happens to me, and when it does it just goes away eventually.But no worries I’m still gonna live, I can’t do that to my friends and family, but i can’t imagine ever being happy until maybe I’m like 50 and just don’t care anymore, but that’s stupid. I wanna be happy in my 20s and 30s, I don’t wanna suffer. It’s stupid.",0

"Just wanna get my thoughts out. I don’t know what to do. I’m really just stuck. Not sure how to describe what I feel. Sad? Overwhelmed? Isolated? Pointless? Depression is nothing new to me whatsoever, but I was doing well until recently. I think my main trigger right now is how stagnant &amp; alone I am. I feel like I don’t really matter. I’m not living the life I desire. I’m not even living a life at all. I wake up everyday and just make it through the day. I see other people dating, getting married, having kids, traveling, partying, etc… and here I am in a mental prison. I yearn to break free and just… do something. But I am just so… sad? I see kids and wish I had my own. I would love to be a mother. I would love to experience pregnancy. I am the only barrier to these things. I let depression tell me I am not worthy &amp; should just sit around &amp; sulk.Saw my psychiatrist &amp; increased my antidepressant to the highest possible dose. Tried a new sleep med. With the medication change, I’m more social/bubbly at work. I can tell that people notice a positive change in my interactions with them… but as soon as I get home I cry. I lay in bed and cry. I think about not being here. I lay in the dark and just stare at the wall. The upbeat personality is fake &amp; the meds just assist me with faking it. I think about how freeing it would be for me to just stop living this way. I feel like such a burden for feeling this way because my family/friends know I’ve been battling this for so long. It feels annoying. It feels pathetic.My therapist pointed out that I’m alive… but I’m really not living. I sit inside all day. I don’t have many friends. I know I should try and make changes, but the way I feel is so crippling. ",0

Every since i finished my 1st year of univesity in a trades program i dreamed of doing since highshool im dead inside i find no joy at all in the things i obsessed over. I want to kms or do something bad. I realized the world is utter shit money runs it but i work hard just to feel empty and have none left to do things. The state of the world sickens me the state of people sickens me. Ive felt this for awhile but my love for what was going to be my career was my last straw im truly lost now. I disasociate throught my days no dreams or ambition anymore. Sometimes at work il sudenly get a tighness in my chest as my thoughts spiral and i start staring blankly and shaking to the core trying not to explode with idk pure sorrow. I dont even have a bad life since i live under my parents roof for free. Help me please one day i might just do something rash,0
"please i really need help trying to understand. there is nobody i would ever talk about these things to so i need online anonymity.why does it feel like no matter what NOBODY seems to want anything to do with me. I dont think people dislike me at all but nobody ever seems to want to even be friends with me. I do have a couple friends, and often times when i hang out with them they have various other friends over. many of the mutual friends i have met dozens of times, talked to dozens of times, but as soon as im not right in front of someones face im forgotten. not even worth adding on social media or anything. why?its probably not hard to figure out i have no luck with women at all. i had a ltr for about 2 years, about 2 years ago she broke up with me. immediately afterwards i was in a “situationship” type of deal and she broke that off with me after about 3 months. those are the only two girls ive ever talked to or ever kissed. both of them were the ones to make the first move and break it off.  since then absolutely nothing. but im always told that if NO women are interested in me then i have to be doing something wrong. it goes without saying it is honestly painful watching essentially all of my friends and all of their friends either in relationships or getting with girls. ALL THE TIME. ALL of them. i have to watch it with a straight face. its literally just me who isntand this sounds stupid, but the thing that honestly makes me feel so much worse is that i know im  decent looking. im also tall, im in decent shape, i have good hygeine. i hear from people pretty often about girls thinking im cute or good looking. but i honestly hate hearing that someone thinks im cute or wtv because that seems to be the only thing people ever have to say about me. and its obviously not enough for anyone to try even talking to me.the way i have been craving any intimacy or affection is fucking numbing. it doesnt matter how distracted i am it only takes something small to ruin my mood and make me on the verge of breaking down. every single night when i try to sleep i overthink for hours, often cry and eventually fall asleep. when i sleep most of the time when i dream its literally about girls, not even sexual lmao usually talking or affectionate stuff. its insane. its a mix of ppl i know irl or random ppl i follow on social media. it makes me feel like a fucking creep. there is no way for me to escape feeling completely unlovable and unwanted. I wake up and put on my social and happy face on and then repeat. i am so sick of feeling like thisi have been trying alot to distract myself and been following the tips to improve myself. I have been alot more engaged in my hobbies, as well as getting into new things, i have been gaining knowledge and learning new skills. i have been listening to new music, i have been buying and dressing in new clothing that i like. i have been working out and trying to be active in different ways. i genuinely really like the job that I have. i have been putting effort in to these things for close to two years now. i have noticed a difference in alot of ways in my life. i do feel happier generally, i do feel more comfortable in my own skin, while i am still pretty shy and im not super talkative, overall my anxiety has improved so much that i am surprised. why doesnt this matter? am i not good enough yet? i still havent improved myself enough yet?  i just want someone to want me. i want someone to think about me, i want to mean something to somebody. why doesnt that seem possible?im “only” 23 but i am really having a hard time not just giving up. i feel like time is running out. people always say stuff like “the right person for you is out there”. I cant wait years just to feel some sort of intimacy with someone (which isnt even guarenteed). and even then, at my current age let alone years from now, no woman would be interested in a guy who has almost 0 experience with women. nobody would be willing and patient to teach me, and i think its totally dishonest to believe otherwise",0
today has been very difficult and one of my weakest days in a while. i’ve been in bed thinking sad things crying and sleeping all day. i’ve been trying so hard to be strong but i’m really crumbling. i wish i could turn back time. i will just sleep more. i wish i didn’t feel i have nothing to live for. i wish i could have stayed strong. i wish i didn’t feel so lonely all the time. im so sorry for everything that i am. for all the mistakes ive made. i wish i could change them. i wish it wasn’t always too late,0

"Where do I start? I get paranoid, scared, cry nearly everyday. Cut myself regularly. Have tried overdosing multiple times on many lethal combinations of drugs in amounts that should kill a 250lb man. Yet, I'm less than half of that. And no matter how hard I try, I always wake up. I'm in my twenties, trans, (MtF)And that's honestly the only thing keeping me going. The only thing that brings me happiness. I look beautiful I'm told.But beneath all that is autism, .major depressive disorder, bipolar, manic episodes, PTSD, anxiety disorder. Who knows what else at this point. I'm very young in nature. I won't go into details such as that, to try to keep some level of anonymity. But it'll become somewhat clear to you.Im pretty dumb and naive. I ended up getting arrested and am still dealing with that and will be for awhile. They said I'd walk free, no charges, for $50k. I wish I had proof of that. But instead knowing that happened and that, being told by the judge they'd let me go if they could. I'm just now the worst I've ever been.I can't work due to panic attacks and manic episodes, rarely eat because I'm never hungry, have gotten a drug addiction that I control, meaning. I actively can set them down for a month+ at a time and not have cravings even after binging. I can't sleep without my plushie. And I have one that goes everywhere with me. I leave my place about 2-3 times a month. I live alone. Have no friends. Never figured out how to make them, despite being a ""likeable person"". No family. I don't understand how society or the world works. It scares me, so much I hide in my place. I hate life, the whole aspect of it. I do not find joy or excitement in anything but pain. And I can't keep living in this shitty world. I keep trying and keep trying to end it. And I always wake up. I don't know how. Junkie friends tell me it's due to tolerance because if they did what I did. They'd be dead. And most of them are atleast 50lbs more than me. I know I need to go to a psych ward. But if they put me in with the guys, I'll become a whore (not joking sadly) and it'll mess with my mental state even more. I also don't know if they'd let me bring my plushie. And if they did. I'm scared something would happen to him or they'd take him. He's all I have. So, we come back to, why the fuck am invincible. Google says they are lethal combinations. I do several lethal combinations all at once. It doesn't fucking work.So any advice at all would help. Ik this is meant for help but you can also help me by helping me find the perfect, failproof way. ",0

"I've lived in the same rental home for 7 years now. Last week, the landlord told me she had decided to sell the house. I scrambled and found a new place in the same section of the city with my 2 current room mates.The anxiety of having to move everything is eating me alive, I am going through everything in this house and getting rid of things that don't need to come, and feel like I'm barely making a dent. Packing up the place I've spent most of my twenties is killing me.The new place is smaller, and slightly more expensive. My room is in the basement, which has a lookout with windows, but I still feel like it's going to be dark and cave-like.Its half of a duplex, I thankfully know the neighbors. But the place feels further from everything, the neighborhood feels cold, there's no fence for my dog anymore. The new place is about twice the distance from my girlfriend's house as the old one. I'm crying so often, and wake up in the morning with my stomach in knots. I can't hardly eat, and have lost 6 pounds in the last week from it. I feel like I am going to hate this new place, and I'm trying so hard to look at it as a fresh start. But I'm struggling with it so much. I tell myself that if I hate it, it's only a year lease.

She’s open sexually she’s done threesomes she’s Bi sexual and she’s completely what I don’t like.But on the other hand we have good connections we talk for hours, she understands me she fills me and she’s there for me even though I’m in the worse time of my life.I found out she’s not interested in kids the only way she would want is doing surrogate which I would never accept it. I want 3 kids and I want it the way I always dreamed it.Ever since I found it I’ve been killing myself, I want to stop talk to her and one day I stop and I feel ok and I’m like whatever the next day I’m all obsessive and crying and her doing threesome or her doing what she do just triggers panic attack in me.My therapist thinks it’s not her I want is what she has provided me and gave me when I needed it the most. And I got attached and I’m afraid I can’t replace her.Idk..Idk if this depression uses her as a trigger and I don’t want her but it’s the fact I can’t have her due to all this situation.I just want to be strong and move on. I want to find someone who’s good for me and can fulfill my family needs and my future goals.I want to stop being sad all of a suddenI used to be the happiest person on earth and now I’m not.One day I want her the second day I don’t.It’s like when I see her she charges me than I don’t care much. Than she goes on vacation and I’m having panic attacks cuz she’s not her..Do you guys recommend using anti depressants for 3-4 weeks just to balance my head so I can think clear?..It’s not me at all but I can’t think clear! I want to enjoy life again…",0
"I’m 22 years old, and have physically, emotionally, and mentally deteriorated significantly since end of 2023. December I started to have anxiety attacks and panic attacks, despite having no history or clear triggers. From there I lost and gained back a woman I loved… the relationship has not proven easy. My health has also taken a turn for the worse this year, I have no idea what’s wrong with me, I’ve been to the doctor, to a neurologist, and next a cardiologist. I feel physically like shit at least 5-6 days out of the week. I’ve even developed issues eating, I’ve struggled to even eat twice a day, I’ve dropped from 178 pounds last year, now, to a measly 157. I personally feel like a pussy because of the constant anxiety and plethora of panic attacks. I’m losing touch with my family, my love, my friends, and especially myself. I’ve fought with depression before, and have always held a strong mentality until this year. Nothing I do helps. I’ve seen a therapist, I’m too afraid to try medication. I’m breaking at the seams, and I need any piece of advice or assurance that I’m not alone, or we all experience this, anything. I pray none of you feel this way, and if you do, you conquer this plague. Love to the world, Godbless. ",0
"I’m indescribably bored and like the title says I have no idea what to do with myself. I sunk like 60 hours into assassins creed Valhalla and I just suddenly don’t want to play it anymore. I don’t have any want to play, watch or do anything else. I genuinely just woke up today empty. I take Sertraline for depression and I missed a few (three) doses last week and felt pretty crummy but it’s been a while since then. It’s too hot to lie in bed comfortably. I just wish I wanted to do something I guess.  ",0
"I don’t want to live, really. I won’t off myself on purpose but I do dream about dying, and I find myself wanting so desperately to be the kind of story you see in a tragic romance, y’know? I want to die loved. I want someone to give me their whole heart and to take mine and then I just pass away feeling like I was cherished, maybe even dying in that someone’s arms; that thought makes me feel so at peace and like I want it so bad. I wouldn’t wish that on anyone though ehehe.. I know that’d be a traumatic experience for that person and I never want to cause someone to suffer. Anyways, this was a pointless ramble after seeing a movie where the girl is sick and she has the boy take her out one last time and dies in his arms basically. I was watching and I just so badly wanted to be that girl. I want an end to the pain and for being loved to be the last thing I knew. Don’t care if it’s cheesy or cliché.",0
I haven't cut myself in a while,0
"For a little information, I tried to end my life last year but I wasn’t successful. I overdosed on my pain medication, I took a lot but it hadn’t been enough. Nobody knew about my attempt, I woke up the next afternoon and I threw away my goodbye letters so none of my family would find out. I do have BPD, depression, anxiety, and a few other things. Nobody knows about my attempt because I really thought it would work and selfishly, I didn’t want people to watch me closely. I’ve been dating my boyfriend for several months now and he’s actually my first relationship. But I feel guilty keeping this a secret. I’ve kept it to myself for so long and I have a history of self harm and other things. Should I tell him about that? I don’t know what to do. Growing up I was always told people don’t care about your problems so keep it to yourself but I see other people outside my family, say otherwise. Is it something I should tell him? I’m terrified of the idea but I feel like I’m lying to him by keeping it a secret. What would you do? ",0
"Hey everyoneI take everything personally and cry at everything. I cry so much that every morning I wake up with swollen eyes. I don't even know why I exist. I just wish that I were never born. And people in my family know that I'm depressed, but for some reason they don't care and roam around happily in the house. This makes me so sad because my feelings are not validated. I try my best to be normal, but at the end of the day, I just can't. There is not a single day I've slept without crying in months. And once I start crying, I lose control over my mind. I throw things away, start screaming, hit myself and lock myself up in the room because I don't want anyone to see how much of a psycho I am. I've tried therapy but it didn't work for me. May be because I got used to this depressed phase and may be I want to be depressed all my life. Please give me advice on how I can be normal and how to not be bothered about anything in life. ",0
"as a highschooler ive made terrible mistakes in my past friendships and social media in general and it has caused the people around me to hate me, everywhere at school i get really nasty stares and i know that they all hate me. for the past two years i have felt so miserable and depressed and my mom is not allowing me to transfer to another school because whenever i try to talk to her about it she makes it all about herself and it is just so pointless to try to tell her anything about my feelings because she will never understand me and i genuinely dont think i can deal with two more school years i just want to start over new and change my approach and make new friends but my mom has 0 faith in me and thinks that no matter what happens i am going to make the same mistakes at a new school. she has never had faith in me and is constantly looking down on me and it makes me feel worse about myself. im afraid to vent to my friends anymore because im scared to become a burden and drive them away. but i feel so horrible right now and i think that if nothing changes i am going to want to kms. i am in so much pain and my mom doesnt care and she never puts my needs before hers and nobody gives a shit about how i feel or what i want. it is always about her her her. i cannot take it anymore and i’d rather be dead than deal with any of this anymore :) i am sick of her selfishness and constant victim behavior when im the one going through shit. i understand she has her own issues and stresses going on but i am genuinely in a terrible place right now and i need help and support. i don’t know what to do about it and all i can do right now is cry about it and sit on my bathroom floor locked myself in here so that i dont try to kms. im in so much pain and i cant see when it will end.",0
"I can't keep moving, I have no more friends, and I've never felt intimacy, or even connected to another human being. This pain is physical now, my chest hurts, and my mind is falling apart. I think I may kill myself soon, I need this feeling to stop. It's so loud, I have to get out. ",0
"Don't mind me, I'm not depressed but I just need a place to vent.My bf (22M) love baseball. His favorite baseball team won tonight. I'm happy for him. And he messaged me, ""I can’t wait to share more happy memories with you."" Sweet right? Well, we weren't even together physically when he sent that. So I know the motive for this affection is because his favorite team won. I used to receive more affection like that regardless of how well his favorite team was doing. But now that we've gotten busy and we're 6 months into the relationship, it's less. Which I've come to accept and I'm okay with. I guess it just hurts that those kinds of messages come when baseball makes him smile, not me. I remember crying about how I was worried that he wouldn't love me if his favorite team lost when we were 3 months into the relationship. That feeling, I hated it then, and I hate it now.",0
right now it seems like my friend my only friend of 6 years is going away from me and idk what to do i dont want to say i need him but i do i have no one else ive done everything for him but it seem to matter and im worried its my fault i have been a jerk but i was true to him and he just hangs up on me idk i need to be happy again ,0

"Im only 16I wonder if there is anyone who can relateI remember being constantly upset about myself since I was a little child. I have always felt lost in this world since the beginning and when i started to go to school it started to be even worseI vividly remember that when I was 7 or 8 i constantly thought about killing myself because it would cure all my socialization problems (i was neglected by other children and considered to be a weirdo) and also make my parents happier. That lowkey sounds dark, but this is how it is.Whenever i remember this i feel pity. I feel miserable. All my life ive been miserable. When other kids were passionate about their hobbies, were making friends and spending their time outside i was in my bed crying on the verge of suicice.Things haven't changed. I dont remember the last time i was happy or woke up in a good mood. I can't push myself to do something. All i do is doomscrolling and crying. And i fucking hate myself because of that. I dont have energy, social connections, skills. I can't be loved. I dont deserve love or affection. And im not even sure if i can change it, maybe some people are born to be horrifically  ocial connections, skills. I cant be loved. I dont deserve love or affection.

Someday your dad has to die. Someday I have to die someday and even if I die first, I still have to experience the pain of not wanting to die. I don’t wanna die. I’m so scared of that, but it feels like there’s no other way to avoid the pain of losing someone.People say to live is to experience the moments you feel happy to create happy memories well what is 70% of the time I’m not happy and all the memories are painful then can someone tell me what’s the point of living?",0

I'm a married man and a dad. But for roughly a year and a half now I've had feelings for a woman at work. Nothing has happened between us and there's no signs of her feeling the same way about me but in this time we have become really good friends. We communicate a lot and have had lots of nights out together and gone to football games together. I'm positive that I'm not her type and that she'd never go for me even if I was single which is a thought that brings me down all the time. I've not been happy at home few a years before these feelings started and I have asked for a divorce in the past but stayed for our son who has additional needs. The woman at work is on my mind constantly and last year when she dated another guy from work it was incredibly rough for me and I'm dreading when she meets the next guy. I feel depressed all the time and I feel like I need to stop being friends with her and maybe find a new job. Has anyone else been in a similar situation and what did you do to get past it?,0
"I've been depressed for around 4 years now, a few months ago i thought it was getting better when i got a partner, but it ended up worse whrn they sexually assaulted me countless times and i couldnt escape it for months. Since then I've not wanted to be alive, my parents dont even believe that im depressed. The only person who cares is my best friend. If she wasnt around then i already have planned how id kill myself. I dont want to be here anymore, i just want to not wake up again",0

"Pretty sure I've had depression since high school, and by now I've already graduated college. I always thought that keeping myself busy would help fight the depression, but it seems as though every day is harder and harder to get through. I can't focus, I constantly feel like crying, and my negative thoughts plague me. I recently got an internship at a law firm (around April), and my self esteem is so low that it's making me incompetent. I can't even make a phone call without panicking and making myself look stupid. I feel like I don't even want to do anything. Getting into a really good law school is my dream, but I don't have the mental energy to work towards it. I feel like every day goes by so fast but so slow at the same time. I don't have enough time to rest, but at the same time I just want to get the day over with. Apart from this constant stress and dread from worrying about my future and not feeling any energy to work towards it, I have no friends. Couldn't make friends in college. I was too scared of social interaction, and that held me back from making any meaningful connections. Now, I'm paying the price. All the bullying in high school traumatized me, and now I don't even know how to communicate like a normal human being. I've never been in a relationship either. I had a crush on a guy, and convinced myself that there's no way he would ever want me. I ruin everything for myself. Why can't I just live normally like everyone else? The daily things that are so easy for most people are so hard for me. I'm barely surviving this, and therapy is too expensive. I don't have the attention span to do anything. I'm losing hope and I'm pretty sure those around me don't want to be around all this negativity. I don't blame them but it reinforces my negative self perception.",0

I tried to have a good relationship with my roommates , I tried to be a good partner, I tried to get in student clubs, I tried to do a science project. I couldn't even accomplish one... Like... All my childhood, my only hope was running away from my home by going to Uni and that's where it got me. I don't have a friend, I dont feel comfortable talking with my family, The only places I can live is the hell I go to Uni in and my emotionally abusive home. I tried to end it all but I just couldn't. I called the only person I can call while crying, begged for him to give me a reason to not end it all. I am so fucking tired of trying... I even tried to go take professional help but I can't take my meds anymore because of some health issues. Like... If there is a god all he do is trip me over to have a good laugh. I dont wanna do anything anymore. Not my old hobbies, not watching a show, not even doomscrolling... I go to sleep just to escape... I dont see any hope for me anymore... I know some people just die... They don't live, they just die... Die without having a proper life. I fear I understood this year that I am one of them. I know I written it pretty messy but I just...

"I know this is going to be a long read but I hope someone takes their time to read it and provide advice for me I've been depressed and suicidal for a very long time but really want to turn things around. I'm 26, got diagnosed with BPD and I have depression and general anxiety. I was a happy normal kid until 13 when my mom(who has mental issues of her own, daily panic attacks as long as I remember, childlike behaviour even at her 50s now) cheated on my dad and I got involved pretty badly, abuse and threats from both mom and cheater guy then my dad found out his mental went all bad since then he's been horrible to everyone and they are still together now altho divorced so anyways my relationship with my parents and sister are very very bad, they ignore my suicidal behaviours and blame my dysfunctional lifestyle on laziness although it's been pretty clear what they did to me fucked my brain up to a point even after 13 years I can't feel normal. They ask me why I'm being the way I am and as soon as I start talking about what happened back then my dad responds with "" I suffered the most i moved on why can't you "" mind you he was 35 and I was 13 at the time he doesn't understand what trauma can do to an undeveloped brain even after my therapist explained it to him. So yeah this is my story so far and why I'm here is cus I really wanna start living one day at a time, not let my perfectionist black and white thinking patterns not ruin my potential, stop emotional eating and physically undo the damage I've done in the last 13 years and also really really need advice on dealing with impulsivity. I'm planning to go to a library tomorrow and get sources on all of these topics and more and if you have advice or a source that can help me with this stuff I'd really appreciate it. Some days I feel like I feel every second it passes like tomorrow won't come altho I know it always will unless I die so that's why I wanna start living one day at a time so I don't just lay in my bed and let my mind go all over the places. I really do think life is supposed to mean something not just counting the days till it is over. ",0
"I'm a 20M, still lives with his loving and caring parents, have a nice paying job 100K+, have my dream car, have people that care about me, but unfortunately doesn't have the pleasure of enjoying life...Everything that felt amazing and loved to do has become painful and joyless, making music isn't fun as it used to, doing photography has become soulless and purely uncreative compared to what it was before, talking to people and trying to know new people has become in my eyes useless and annoying.A few years back during covid, I had started a depression that lasted for 3 years, wanted to kill myself constantly, I had some dark thoughts about taking a gun up to my mouth and just pull the trigger, or do it in a peaceful way and take pills before sleeping in hopes of never waking up again.I have always had issues with making female relationships, I've had a few in the past but nothing that lasted more than 2-3 weeks, I have this social pressure from my friend group, every single one of them has a gf,  being asked by my colleagues at work how come at my age I don't have a gf, has severely taken a toll on me. Feels like the only way I start enjoying things in life, is when I put my life at risk, like driving at high speeds but even then sometimes it doesn't feel scary like it used to, playing video games is now unbearable, I play for a few minutes and then turn off my pc, talking and doing activities with my friend group is now unpleasurable.I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like working everyday for nothing, I spend my money like crazy, hoping that the materialistic things in life would make a difference but nothing, feel happy for few hours and then get used to it, feels like an endless cycle of torture and pain for nothing.The dark thoughts are slowly coming back to me, I feel it, as soon something bad happens, my anxiety levels sky rocket, and the thoughts of ending life start as jokes.

"I'm currently trying to become a functioning member of society again, after spending the past few months severely depressed, sheltered in my parents house, staring at my phone all day, abusing alcohol and marijuana. Now, somehow, I'm going to the gym almost every day, looking/applying for jobs, and haven't abused substances in over a month. Despite my progress, I feel like I've hit a roadblock and have still been feeling empty, lonely and uninterested. Every day feels the same and even more boring than the last. I still find myself on my phone/laptop for 5+ hours a day and even that is starting to lose its appeal. The one thing I truly want to do is spend time and have meaningful conversations with someone, but there isn't really anyone in my life where I can comfortably do that with. I have a few friends, but they are too far away to see in person. Sure, I have my parents and my therapist, but conversations with them always feel awkward and I'm scared to bring up some things with them. Needless to say, I've been spending a lot of time alone, and I haven't been able to find anything to do by myself that I enjoy or am passionate about that might help me overcome depression. Why do I feel like I need someone else to feel happy? Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can feel more self-fulfilled?",0
Im the worst in my class i try my hardest everyday but i’m still a failure who doesn’t deserve anything. My best is never enough. I’m so pathetic. I did horrible today. I hate myself. I’ll never be good enough. I wanna give up. I don’t even know what’s my purpose in life. I’m just another human taking up space. I’m the only one in class getting corrected. Everyone else does things perfectly. I’m the only one making mistakes. I’m never gonna get anywhere in life. I cant see myself living past 18. As punishment i’m starving myself because failures don’t deserve food. And I need to loose weight.,0
"Like I should be happy right now… im up north with my family and everything should be fine but no, im in my bedroom while everyone else is outside and enjoying it. I don’t want to go outside because I’ll just make it awkward and weird, I’d rather just sit in the bedroom and just scroll through depressing tiktoks and not talking to anyone for majority of the day. I just don’t know how much more longer I can keep this up before I actually go out and kill myself",0
"It’s dawning here. I spent my night alternating between mindless scrolling, running with my thoughts about my health, my marriage and my life, and trying to fall asleep.I don’t think I can take much more of it. I am an utter disappointment. I’m praying for at least an injury that ends in hospitalization so I have a decent time off from everything. I love my wife who constantly hurts me and it feels like she doesn’t give a shit about me. I know I will have to file for divorce soon, but am terrified of all that it brings.I wish I could just fall asleep and never wake up.",0

"I haven't always been such a mess. For most of my life, I was doing really well, actually. Ranked top in school, attended top university, got a job at Fortune 500, climbed the ladder up fairly quickly, moved in between countries for prestigious jobs, founded a company, grew a team, had lots of friends and acquintances.Until one day (around 15 months ago), after many years of working super hard and burning out, I snapped and fell into a severe depression and anxiety.Since then, things turned different. Good things did come out of it though! I rekindled old precious friendships, took better care of my health. But for the most part, things have been pretty shit. I left the company I founded (with nothing on hand) after an unfortunate series of conflicts and bad blood with my business partner during my depression. I lost some friends and strained some family relationships. After my recovery, I ended up helping the family business for a bit but I've been going through a rought patch due to conflicts with my parents, which essentially stemmed from their low level of trust in me, so I'm likely leaving soon. I've put in a chunk of my money in my previous company so saving is thinning. I've been seeing this woman I really like but might have to put it on hold due to all of the instability that's happening right now. It's like Murphy's law, all crazy shits happening right now. I'm often stressed and sad.I don't know what to do, I feel lost, but I do need to pick myself up and rebuild again soon, moving to another country and starting over sounds quite appealing. I don't know what to do, but I'll have to figure something out soon. I'd appreciate any words of encouragement, I'm feeling very lonely and sad now.",0

I wanted to say this because this news was fairly recent i play a lot of golf recently in the past couple months he committed suicide he was a two time winner on the pga tour which is the top tour for those that don't know and he struggled with alcohol addiction and depression its in my heart because those are the two things that i relate to and it makes me sad to see with someone with that much fame and money its not the thing that solves or beats depression may his soul rest in piece Greyson Murray,0

"There have been times in my life (when my depression was less severe) that I had a “best friend” or knew that I was important to people or was someone’s favorite person to spend time with. As I’ve gotten older, my close friends have gotten into relationships, and my relationships with friends and family have been damaged by periods of severe depression. One thing that I really struggle with now is knowing that the people I’m closest to don’t feel the same about me. I don’t believe in a higher power, and the reason I’ve stuck around this long is to not hurt those around me. It just doesn’t feel like me being alive or dead would make much of a difference to the people I care about. I’m struggling to maintain purpose and any sort of desire to stay alive because of this.

"I'm not enjoying life. I have so much time to myself,  more than any person has any right to, but I don't want to use it.I wake up depressed every morning thinking about the same stupid s***. It can take me as much as three hours to finally feel distracted enough that I can do simple chores around the home.But then I'm back in place with nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nobody to talk to, and I wish I could just terminate my existence instantaneously.It's way beyond the point of possibly getting better. I'm in my mid-thirties, but I'm living with the same social and emotional deficit I've had since over *twenty years ago*. My life might as well have never happened.I'm like, decades deep into a situation where I can't make a connection with anyone. It's just too painful for me to socialize even in the most superficial ways imaginable. Every relationship I have or have had is unsalvagable as far as I'm concerned.It's just that now, I know it'll never happen. There will never be a turn around. I knew that ten years ago and it's still the same today. I'm just too damaged from the things that I've been through.Even if I could fix the worst parts of my life, and repair the relationships that have hurt me the most, I still have like, 20 years of depression and resentment to overcome and that's practically impossible - it's just not going to happen.So instead of feeling good about the day and setting myself up for the future, I'd rather just see the ending now and get it over with. If my life is going nowhere as it has been, I'm tired of playing the part.It makes me feel sad to see people much younger than me struggling here in r/depression with difficult situations, and I feel so badly for people who lose their lives without so much as a choice in the matter. Life doesn't owe me anything - I don't even deserve life. I wonder how long it can go on this way. How much worse will it get before I've had enough?",0

I look at other people, same amount of followers or something with way more attention than I ever get and I just wonder what I’m doing wrong or if people are choosing to specifically ignore me.

"- please I like can’t wait any longer for my sex drive to fix . I’ll go to a drug store today 10mg trintellix since May 13th upped dose to 15mg couple weeks ago, l've noticed some benefits in my anxiety some depression benefits too. I still am dealing with sexual side effects as I was before starting, I thought it would get better but if anything it has gotten worse, this has been making me feel very depressed. I've been dealing with it for so long now, and it's tearing me down. If I could find some cure to my ED Libido issues I feel my mental health would be a lot better, but l also may need to be open to switching meds because I feel as if maybe my mental health is what has been causing my sexual issues, also I'm a male and young. Any advice on treatment or medicine to take to help resolve this long term is greatly appreciated, I meet with my Nurse Practitioner to talk about this a little over a week from today, and getting on a medication to hopefully cure this bs.

No friends no losing job no car  and I just moved in my first apartment and it’s been very overwhelming . I been crying for the past 3 weeks to my self and can’t stop crying. My heart aches.

Mentally and physically feel ill and exhausted. I put on a fake persona around everyone  I have family and friends my friends always encourage me to ever tell them if I don’t feel right but really I don’t feel right talking to them about it or anything I’m always there for them and give the best advice I can but I never want to talk. I get these waves of anxiety that are bad I’ve got bad social anxiety. I may have all these people around me who care but I truly feel alone can’t remember the last time I was truly happy .I have substance abuse issues my friends always note I do way more than I should but the only time I feel relieved is when I’m not sober and not there . No one knows about how badly I am feeling bc I don’t want to talk to them about it bc I can’t handle them knowing about my problems I can’t trust anyone with this . Idk why I made this maybe because I know no one who I really know will ever see this ,0

"I (19f) always felt like i was nothing, never really seen or heard, i was never important to anyone.  If someone talked to me, it was usually to mock me, make fun of me for my appearance, that's all i was good for. I don't enjoy my life, never did, there's no reason to stay. Everyone seems to have some problem with me, maybe it's my fault, maybe it's theirs, doesn't matter, I don't care. I wrote a few posts in the past about how i feel, my suicidal thoughts, which are on my mind every single day now, but I think that Im getting close to writing my last. Not that anyone cares really, Im just a stranger. I don't care about improving on things anymore, I tried and I failed and even if I didn't, I'd still be miserable. Im tired and the only thing I want at this point is death. Just an escape from this cruel world. It's a shame I'll have to do it myself, those who made me feel bad throughout the years could finish the job, have fun one last time, but that would make it too easy for me.  As for my family, I never had a close relationship with them, my mother left me, my father is an emotionally unstable manipulative narcissist, so I don't think they'll care too much. So yeah I guess that's it, I already wasted too much of your time with this pointless post. Have a good day.",0
"Hi I’m not great with Reddit and I don’t really use it but I just want any advice or just something. Throughout my entire teens (I’m 20 now) I’ve just felt something missing from my life. I try and change something in my life because I think “that must be the problem” but it never is, I always end up here in just this pit of agony. I thought leaving high school would make me happy, I thought college would make me happy, I thought giving up swimming would make me happy, I thought leaving college would make me happy, I thought having a best friend would make me happy, I thought having no friends and focusing on myself would make me happy, I thought falling in love would make me happy, I thought living away from home would make me happy. Nothing. Ever. Lasts. I used to SH to take away this feeling but I don’t want scars all over me. I’ve thought about suicide my whole life but I’ve never attempted. I’m too afraid of failing and hurting my family and bf. I’m afraid I ask too much of my bf and it frustrates him because he thinks that nothing will ever be good enough for me. That he’s trying his best and I know he is. I just want someone to take away my pain, I want him to but I know it’s too much to ask. I feel like a worthless person just clinging onto people to make me feel something. I just don’t want to feel like this anymore and I don’t know what to do. I don’t have a diagnoses of anything, I’m thinking bpd or autism. But I don’t self diagnose. How do I stop feeling like a nuisance to everybody? ",0

"I'm a night owl. I work at night. I stay awake during the night and sleep during the day. With my depression, sometimes my room feels way too large for me. I needed something smaller. So, what did I do? I transformed my walk-in closet to a hideaway space. I've filled it with pillows and fluffy blankets. I have a fan in there to keep me cool. My laptop is in there, some of my favorite books, and a reading light. I added some electric candles so as to not kill myself in a fire. Also, they add some pleasant illumination to the place as I don't like harsh lighting. I prefer dim lighting so that my eyes don't hurt. I have a box of snacks and a case of water, soda, and seltzer water to keep me hydrated. Is this weird? I don't think so. I feel secure in my little space, safe from the world and all its problems.",0
"So I’m starting my new job soon at a hotel and it’s one of those fancy luxury ones. I’m super proud of myself that I managed to get such a good job, but because of my depression I have poor hygiene. I brush my teeth maybe once or twice a week sometimes less and I can go a week or two without being forced by my mom to take a shower. I thought it was just laziness that I didn’t want to take care of myself but now that I’m getting help from others who are struggling with depression I understand why I do this.I’m wondering if there’s any tips or ideas people can give me to be more hygienic. I want to be my best self when I go to work and honestly not have bad breath and cavities anymore.

"Hi, I am 37 years old, and on mid 2023, I took a sick leave from the hospitality industry, due to overwork, insults and threats from the person in charge, hard demands from customers, and I decided to prioritize my well being. It was bad to the point that I hated living, and my self esteem went way down, I was told I had imposter's syndrome. Around December, and by being with family and through counseling, I slowly started to recover.During this sick leave, I decided I wanted to change industries, and despite being scammed by a web development school who told me they would 'help me' change careers and did nothing to help me, my morale didn't go down, and it was an ok test for me. It sucked but it is what it is and it could have been worse. Finally after months of looking for jobs, I got one with a decent schedule and salary and I was put in a big project, and I thought things were picking up again. Boy, I was wrong. I got assigned a trainer, who wanted to rush my traning, and she didn't care that this a new type of work for me, she exagerated saying ""she explained to me 1000 times"", when she explained me one or two times, and she did not like when I asked her for assistance, she ignored me when I asked for help in certain tasks, and lied to the superiors, saying I didn't type down anything, which is the opposite, and I typed down many things. And to be honest, I did an ok job for a starter, and it is normal to make one or two mistakes when beginning, but she doesn't see it that way. Then I found out she was putting me down to other colleagues behind my back, and even when I confronted her, she put on a mask and said that ""she would try to help me more"".I was wrong again, two weeks later I was kicked off the project, but not fired, now I barely have any tasks(which consists of cold calls and checking repeatitive sheets), and I am being told that eventually they will find a new project for me, and to bear with it. All my hard work to gain my self esteem back is now shattered again, I am afraid of being fired due to false information being spread about me(even though I have already spoken with superiors and they told me not to worry),I am not happy in my current role, and I just feel sad basically and doubting everything i do. I would appreciate any feedback on tips of what to do to try to get back on track, please. Thank you!",0

"I met him when I was 19 and he was 24 I think, he was my first boyfriend so I was new to the whole relationship thing. second time we hung out he introduced me to his girl best-friend, little did I know this whole time he was manipulating me into being in some kind of three way relationship that I did not want but because I loved him so much I tried to be okay with it and we had threesomes all the time. At some point it wasn’t fun anymore because I could tell the girl wanted my boyfriend and me out of the picture. My boyfriend did not do anything about it. after that it started being really hard for me to have sex with him because I felt so insecure and unwanted and I had so much anxiety that my body rejected him. It hurt so much while having sex with him I was dry, bleeding, there was cuts and I had recurring yeast infections. Even tho all of that was happening he was still having sex with me which made me bleed even worse (worst pain in my life) I was crying in front of him and he never seemed to notice. I was stupid for not having and boundaries I just wanted him to choose me and love me since I knew sex was so important for him. now they are in a relationship together and it makes me so disgusted and depressed how come I’m here still suffering from the r** my body doesn’t work anymore like it used to I feel like at this point I should just kms.

"I have been treating my depression for about 5 years with 30-40 mg of Methylphenidate daily and 1mg of Rexulti. The only thing the Rexulti wouldn’t solve was the lethargy which the methylphenidate helps with. However, sometimes I wonder if others who have had some success with stimulants to manage their depression have success stories with other stimulants. The cocktail I’m on was a game changer compared to everything else I’ve tried (the list of anti depressants and stimulants I’ve tried is about 40 items long). But I haven’t really tried other stimulants. During the valleys, what I’m on is still not quite enough. During the better periods I feel like I’m struggling but can manage. While previously it always felt like I was always suffocating and sometimes drowning, now, the moments of real struggle are shorter but I yearn for a higher quality of life.I’m particularly seeking out those of you who like me don’t get a “high” from Ritalin, but use it to manage ADHD and depression symptoms but maybe found something more effective.

John cant pay me back. John borrows from Hank. John cant pay Hank back either. Yet John gets invited on all the new group meetings, which Hank is ""head"" of. I know im being selfish. But just because i dont have cancer, i dont deserve friends? Fuck the money, i just want companionship 🙏 i was mad about the money at first, even bothered him about it afew times. But the cancer put it all into a new perspective. ",0
"I’ve never known what depression felt like until now. Im a single mum working full time and depend on my family to help look after my child so I can get some sort of income. Anyways I’ve been feeling out of tune with myself for the past 2 months but I just thought it was my monthly doing what it usually does, but that off feeling never stopped once I had finished. I lost interest in food and I’m a big foodie but still thought nothing of it. I spoke up about how I don’t feel like myself, yet no one reached out to ask me what was wrong. It wasn’t till yesterday I started having thoughts about wanting my life to end right then and there but the thought of my child pulled me back to reality and realised my mental health is not where it’s at. I held everything in for so long and something so small triggered me and it just blew up. Now I’m an emotional wreck and don’t know how to adult right now. I don’t even know how to parent right now and my child is the one comforting me when it should be the other way around. I don’t know I just don’t even want to try and do better I’ve been through the works at a young age and I’m finally over it. Tired of being the one people rely on. Tired of being the one to give. Tired of being told I’m strong when I’m just trying to live. ",0

"(i don’t expect anyone to read this i just have to get it off my chest). i’ve been dissociating a lot. i sit in bed all day doing nothing, im wasting my life and it feels like there’s nothing i can do to change it. every day i think “maybe it’ll get better, keep tryin God got u” but it’s starting to seem like he doesn’t, I know he does I just don’t feel it. i’m losing myself and the people around me due to the way i feel. i can’t hold a simple conversation, im bland and don’t want to be bothered. i just want to sit in bed all day and waste away until i die. i can’t even stand going to school 5 days a week that’s how lazy i am. i cut myself to feel something different(not that often tho). i don’t like anything about myself or anything around me. i’m just so fucking pessimistic, full of hate, and mean for no reason, i just can’t control it. i complain about everything, every time im engaging in a conversation, i just somehow end up on a negative topic speaking in a negative tone, i hate the way i act. i really just hate myself in general, inside and out. i’m actually fucking drained and i hate how people think just because im 14 that means that i can’t be going through things, im actually in the verge of killing myself and try to mask it every day. if i were to kill myself right now there would be nobody that could say “i’ve always had her back and tried to help her every step of the way, i cared so much about her” absolutely nobody. im the only reason i haven’t killed myself yet, there’s nobody telling me to keep going and to hang in there but myself and i feel like it’s because nobody gives a fuck; i don’t play an important enough role in anybody’s life so nobody cares about how i feel or what i go through. im always the last thought and the person people forget about or leave behind. i feel like if nobody gives a fuck about me then what difference would it make if i were to kill myself, eternal happiness and everybody free from me inconveniencing them. my mother would never have to worry about spending too much on me every again, she’ll never have to say she wishes she never had kids again. nobody will be held back by me ever again. all it takes is 1 bullet, 1 bottle of ibuprofen, 1 rope, 1 river, 1 tall building, or 1 train and i’ll be set free.",0
"For context, these people that said these comments are aware I take antidepressants and that I have depression. They know I was homeless for four months and schizophrenic during that time, so they need to not hold me to the same high standards they give themselves. BTW my hygiene is decent. I don’t ever smell bad. But stuff like nails and hair get dirty because of the nature of my job.It’s not your responsibility to criticize a mentally ill persons poor hygieneExample 1: I got cornrows a month ago and I took them out two days ago. There were still knots and matting even after I showered. Today I FaceTimed my ex turned friend who lives far away from me and she gave me a verbal lashings because she has curly hair too and knows when the hair is starting to become dreaded and matted. I already knew my hair wasn’t looking great. I thought I’d FaceTime her before I shower, but I quickly learned that she won’t accept me unless I’m presentable to her. I’m convinced I can drop the friendship and find someone better who doesn’t verbally criticize me for 5 straight minutes about how unhygienic I am. It’s a behaviour that shows the person as completely devoid of empathy, from my perspective of a mentally ill person. The thing is my hair was clean. I just have difficulty LOOKING hygienic. I smell, feel, and am hygienic though. I went out to the nightclub the same day after taking my braids out and I was able to get girls numbers, and have a good time. No one batted an eye about my hair. I take antidepressants for depression as well as antipsychotics. ITS POSSIBLE FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH DEPRESSION TO GO OUT AND FUNCTION NORMALLY BUT STILL STRUGGLE.Example 2: The other week my friend with benefits and I hung out on a Friday night. I slept over at her place. I didn’t wanna have sex (low libido) but she did. I didn’t come. We did it twice. I had gotten called in for a shift so I left and she said she wants to hangout right after I finish work. I went to hers and she was traumatized by the state of my nails. I’m blue collar and my nails aren’t always cut very short because I frankly don’t think about it ever. But they’re still short just not skin level. So there was some dirt. I told her it’s not as dirty as she is saying. She kept telling me I can’t finger her or go near her private parts with my nails. Obviously it was a misunderstanding because I didn’t wanna fuck her. These type of friends can leave my life and it would be perfectly fine with me because they show me they have no capacity to show me grace. I want to be able to be a little bit ugly around my friends. ",0

"....is counterproductive.Gonna preface this by saying that im aware a lot of depressed people appreciate this, as its a well-intended gesture of looking out for someone.For me, though....it tends to make things worse.When im trapped in the absolute hell that is my depressed mind and chronically-in-pain body day in and day out, the last thing i need is someone asking me nearly every day ""how are you feeling?"".Especially when they damn well know as ive made it very clear.I finally texted something different back to a friend who does this, pretty much saying that not a loy has changed, and what would really help me is if the topic of our conversation could be focused on something thats NOT me - as im trapped in my body 24/7 and the last thing i need is to be reminded of how miserable i feel.

"Nothing just seems worth it anymore. I have a mother with stage 4 terminal breast cancer. Just recently quit my job due to the stress it gave me but i know for sure that these thoughts have been bottled for so long. Everything just doesnt seem worth it.

Can count the friends i have on one hand and even then i dont think they could help as they have their own lives to live. Even when theyve tried it doesnt really help. Ive Been through multiple hobbies either just to see others doing it better than me or realising im not good at it either. Ive kept trying and trying and im starting to lose it. Its not fair having to see how easy people make it. I know all of it is a facade but even then whats the point? Even to the time im writing this im applying for new jobs but for what?To just slowly kill my self mentally, physically and spiritually? The same shit that made me leave my previous job?Am i supposed to sacrifice any time to do what i need to heal just to feed myself and not become homeless? Is there any point to that? Ive been waking up so far just to go through days where i feel so useless. So worthless. So lost. Every important choice ive made has been because of neccessity. Of survival. I just have this constant feeling time is ticking. Like i dont have long.  Like im wasting time. And at this point ive honestly started to accept this might be the end of my story.I keep saying in my head now ""this might be it."" Or ""im getting close to the end."" And i really believe it. Im hanging on a small fishing line and honestly i can feel that it will snap soon. And i will fall. My mind is just processing how to accept the ending at this point. Its getting so close to having absolutely no hope for me. If my mother goes im honestly thinking of going with her. Idk and idc if i dont go to the same place as her.

Now me as an unemployed introverted person had forgotten what's normal anymore. Isn't my younger sister is capable of preparing meals for herself? By the way, we are Asians and usually in the household, there needs to be a teamwork for someone who cooks for the overall members. But my mom has some beliefs or rules in life that are not the usual practiced in most families. This case in particular.Also, I have a remote or freelance online work at night sometimes. I need that flexible schedule to do my own thing. Sometimes I have different eating schedule and I feel forced to do this.Am I the AH for discussing this to my sis to not feel bad if I can't cook for her? I told her to learn to prepare for herself. I also told her I'll cook if I feel like it. I already feel exhausted in life. I can't even prep for my own. I would prefer to starve or just order online. I want to be comfortably lazy or have  freedom.Lmfao, ok i know how ridiculously not a big deal this is but with a parent that disrupts my beliefs on what's norm, I don't know if I'm doing right. Also, mom has personality disorder where she doesn't trust. She don't trust the food we prep for her. For years we lived with her and she never trust her food around us.

"Greetings, people of reddit. I have a problem, and I kinda need someone's point of view in this. I have been nothing but a burden to my own family and friends in my 18 years of life. No matter what I do, I either I fail as a friend, or fail as a son. I've tried countless times to change but I fail each and every time. So, my question is: Should I go to a country that allows euthanasia and pay them for my own demise? Or should I keep on trying? Because at this point I am tired of life. It has been an endless circle of me trying to do better but fail time and time again. Now, the reason why I ask you, people of reddit, of your opinion on my situation is because I have no clue on how to live my life out. Because if you agree to me flying to a country that allows mercy k*****g then I'd gladly go for it, I'm not really someone to remember. Heck, I bet some of the people I know irl might even forget me. If you disagree with my plan, I'd gladly try again and hope I can maintain my sanity.That is all. From yours truly,Kertz",0

"Alright, so i’m a 24 year old man and i’ve been dealing with a breakup from a 10 year long relationship with my ex-fiancé. We were both high school sweethearts and celebrated our 10 year anniversary earlier this year in feb, where i proposed to her and she had said yes, i was the happiest man alive, knowing i wanted to spend the rest of my life with this woman. What i thought was going to be forever from then on, only turned out to be a short, less than 2 months of being engaged, and she had left me with not much explanation of why. Since then, i’ve fell into a deep depression that i haven’t been able to get out of. We stayed in contact for a few weeks, maybe a month, but i could already feel she fully let go of me and what we’d had, almost as if it was so easy and meant nothing to her. I can’t say that’s what she felt, but to me that’s how it felt. Not long after the month of talking, I noticed it was only me trying to initiate and regain what we had, initiate conversations, and then one day i got no reply… realising that i had been ghosted and forgotten. This realisation broke me fully. I’m blocked on all social media as well. After a decade, was this all i was worth in the end? not even a respectful message saying that we should stop contact? Idk if i’m right or wrong to feel this way, but i feel disrespected and almost worthless to the woman i’d loved with all my heart and spent a decade with, both of us growing through our teenage years and into adulthood, just to be left and forgotten so easily.. We weren’t perfect, we had ups and downs, but we’d gotten thru it all thru out the years and had gotten stronger (at least i felt) as we grew together. I just been finding it hard to get through this, i’ve deleted all photos from my phone, conversations, everything, yet she still haunts me in my dreams.i’ve been living in another country the past 2 months as i get thru this breakup, but fr i don’t know what to do, because rn i have no job, no money and no friends so every day and night has been pretty hard mentally. I don’t know how long i’ll be able to take this if im being honest.being away from my home country i’ve stopped smoking weed and haven’t drank for these 2 months and even though im sober, i would love to smoke up at least lol.a whole decade of my life, and it all meant nothing.",0

"Hi. I’ve been depressed most of my life, but things got especially bad the past few years - most days I could barely get out of bed. Moreover, I struggled with binge eating for a long time, which combined with a total lack of physical activity led to a pretty bad case of obesity.  Now I’m medicated and in therapy, and feel like I finally have enough motivation to start being more productive, but sadly my body just can’t keep up. Any kind of physical activity, like a few minutes of doing chores or a slow 15 minutes walk with my dog, feel extremely hard and uncomfortable. I start feeling extremely hot, and sweat so much that my clothes get damp. It gets so bad that often I just avoid going outside altogether, as I can’t do that without feeling extreme discomfort and exhaustion. I keep trying to be more active here and there, but it doesn’t get any easier, and I feel like I’m making no progress at all, which is really demotivating.    If any of you have been dealing with something similar, I’d love to hear what helped you get over the discomfort and keep pushing forward.

Rather than supporting me and helping me, she suggested I stay with my parents for a bitA year ago, she broke up with me6 months ago, I decided to move away from home and start a brand new life5 months ago, I started healing from my breakup…then my mom had a stroke3 months ago, I had to leave my previous job because they could no longer support me working remote2 months ago, I found a bridge job for a significant pay cutNow I’m stuck in a state with just 1 friend (no intention on moving back home, I need this for my journey), with a sick mom, a family too busy helping mom to check in on me,  a healing broken heart, friends back home not checking in on me, a shitty low-paying bridge job with no one else hiring, no dating prospects, just feeling like I have nothing to hang my hat on.

"I can’t remember the last time I was particularly happy. I’m 30, never really had romantic feelings and didn’t think I was capable of it. Found a partner online and we were long distance. We’d been together three months and broke up last weekend.My literal thoughts are I’m better off here because they’ll be a few people who’ll be upset if I’m gone. But that’s not a long term reason to keep on going. I barely have the will to look after myself, how do I find a reason to keep going?",0

"I am a 15y/o male from the UK who suffers from depression and suicidal thoughts. I have been a 'smart' kid since very young in primary school. The reason I am smart is due to my parents overworking me since I could read and write. It started as 30 minutes of maths every day after school, which definately helped me with maths in school, and let me have an actual challenge as I quickly found it very easy to do what my school provided. By year 6 however (around the start of when covid was appearing) it had gotten to 45 minutes of work before school and 1 hour after at a minimum in preparation for my SATs (end of primary school test in the UK). For reference, other students were doing 10-20 minutes a day maximum. Because of covid, I never did my SATs. I got into a good secondary school as a 'genius' and was the top of my class in everything. I was predicted 8s in everything (in the UK we use 1-9 as grades for GCSEs, 1 being bad and 9 being good) as it was school policy not to predict 9s. I am now in my summer holidays after year 10, going into year 11. We did our first round of mocks just before we left for the holiday and I got 5s and 6s in most subjects (I take music, computer science, history and spanish for my GCSEs), apart from maths which I got an 8 and computer science which I got a high 7. The only reason I got higher scores in maths and computer science is due to me liking the subjects and having very good teachers for them. I strongly believe that it is my parents fault that I am getting scores this low on my test due to them making me do so much school work outside of school (around 1-2 hrs now). This has also lead to me having no social life as I am at home so much doing school work. The few friends which I do have are amazing and a large part of why I am still alive today. I feel like my parents are trying to use me as a mini them, doing what they wished they had done when they were my age, as they think that this will help me, however it blatantly doesn't. They both didn't do enough when they were young, and ended up only just getting jobs which get the overall household income to around £80,000 for a family of 4, which is by no means poverty, but is also not anywhere near a good amount of money. I think they believe that making me do tons of work now will mean that I get a good job. I have heard them talking about me, and how they hope that they can retire early and live a rich life when they are old from my money (if I do somehow end up rich, I can tell you for a fact nothing will go to them).The issue is furthered by my mental conditions, and my parents denial of them. I can tell you for a fact that I am a sociopath, and am very sure that I am also autistic. I have talked to both of them about it, and they have laughed it off and said that they don't have it so I can't. We live in England, and have free healthcare under the NHS, all they have to do is apply for a checkup. Literally 10 mins per. Thats it, but they can't even do that for me, yet force me to do hours of school work a day, even in holidays.I also workout, and have for a while, leading to body dismorphia (thinking your muscles are smaller than they are) which has lead to many injuries from me working out more frequently and with more weight then I should have to try and grow them to an impossible standard my brain sets for me.All fo these factors have lead to me not wanting to live, and considering ending it multiple times per day. As I have previously mentioned, my friends are most likely the only reason I am alive. I know they could help me get through it if I tell them, but I can't bring myself to tell them, I don't know why, I know I should but I just can't.I know how I would (probably will) kill myself: I have rope tied under my bed which I have tied into a noose multiple times. I would grab the rope, get a bottle of bleach and a sharp knife, go down my road to a tree which I have tested the branches of and found a suitable one. I would climb to the correct branch, tie the rope into a noose around my neck and attach it to the tree. I would drink the whole thing of bleach, slit both my wrists (lengthwise), slit my throat, stab myself in the heart, and then fall off the tree to strangle myself. I know that it seems over the top, but I know that if I am going to kill myself then I want to do it, so this ensures that it will work.I put this out there so if I do kill myself, and an investigation into it happens, this will hopefuly come out and reveal how bad my parents are.This is a throwaway account by the way,I will look at this account now and then if I can remember the login details and am still alive (assume the latter).",0

"My wife is very emotional and she will become very anxious and emotional over small things. So my wife has been suffering from anxiety and depression due to sudden changes in her life and responsibilities . She will become very fearfull over paranormal things. She also sleeps at night and become very frightened over sudden awokeness.All the depression anxiety leads to mental breakdown and panic attack which I feared most. After that mental breakdown I see some changes in her behaviour sometimes acting like a child, sudden crying and then starts laughing, also at one time she identifies herself as different person like a possessed person. Its been three months and her health has been improved but her childing behavious, wanting something and then don’t like it, brain fog, forgetting things has not fully healed. So please advice me what to do so that my wife will healed to what she was before. ",0

"I was learning Japanese and was made fun of and accused of having a secret Japanese bf. I bought so many books and was so deadset on learning. Then I got depressed, job hunting is currently a fail and I’m constantly being compared to their friends successfull kids, some of their friends kids are getting married and I don’t think that will ever happen to me because of how controlled and boxed in I am. Now I don’t have the energy to study Japanese at all, like I WANT to but I just can’t anymore for some reason. Instead of encouraging me and helping me out of my depression they get mad at me, make me feel guilty etc. if I’m in a bad mood they don’t ask “What’s wrong, lets talk about it” they say “Did you take your anti depressants today?” They also tend to make it about them. They even try to dictate my feelings “why are you angry” when I’m not etc.My therapist told me once “its not you, its your environment” I told them this in hopes of any change but nada. They just acted like they didn’t hear me (which is another issue in itself because this alwaya happens) I want to go back to learning Japanese but I just can’t seem to pick up a book and start again, all I do is “watch” YouTube and lay in bed waiting for another rejection letter to come in or another guilt tripping session from my parents, I also seem to be wide awake at night when everyone else is asleep and weirdly during those hours I feel more—myself than during the day",0

"I truly, from the bottom of my heart, hate the fact that I am indifferent about everything in my life. I am 30 years old, I have no friends, no hobbies, no job, no skills, no anything. I am effectively an 18 year old high school graduate with a decaying body. Every morning I wake up and try to think of any kind of goal or dream to purse and come up blank. Even if I were given infinite cash and resources to pursue a goal I would still be sitting on my ass wasting away. It pisses me off because WHY me? It feels like every single other person on the planet has something they want out of life except me. Why can't I have ambitions or desires? My desire is to have a desire and that isn't working out too well for me.I feel so much hostility and jealousy towards anyone I see online who has any kind of passion or drive, which is most people, and it heavily impairs my ability to form any kind of connection with anyone. I can't even fake it because I can't force myself to give a shit about anything a potential friend would care about.This goes beyond depression, it is the worst feeling on earth and I wouldn't wish it on anyone.",0

"14F, my mom was abusive whilst we grew up so I didn’t really learn hygiene. I only brush my tongue because my friend told me I should. When I hit puberty that’s when is got grim I will just say I was a child exploring new things but I didn’t know how to take care of myself and all my mom did was shame me , I also went through heaps of sexual trauma so that didn’t help my case. I went through big dips of depression and my mental health was bad. And so was my hygiene I suffered with worm all the time and my room was a messMy friend comes over a lot and there was times she touched and used things I did not want her to touch or use and it still haunts me (There was Vaseline I used that I didn’t want her to, I won’t get into it because it was embarrassing and disgusting . I told her not to but she kept asking and ended up using it anyway  so I just thought it was okay because in my head it was normal  and then I completely forgot why I didn’t want her to and kept letting her)I feel so disgusting and nasty and I want to die . Even now I just took a shower the first proper one in ages and I still feel dirty.And my friend was even sort of brought into it. I’m a hazard and I should just dieHow do I fix myself.Edit1: I wanna thank u for the advice. I won’t get into the friend touching my things or Vaseline as that was private and again embarrassing.

"I just turned 20 a few months ago. I doubt anyone will actually read this, kinda just want to type it out honestly. I really feel like I've failed at every facet of life. I'm very introverted, I held good grades in High School and before. I went to uni and bombed a lot of classes, and made very few friends. I've never been in a relationship before. I'm grappling a lot with my sexuality as well. The only thing I have going for me is that I'm in amazing shape for some reason. It's pretty much the only thing I haven't failed at since it's pretty easy for me. But recently I feel like there really is no tangible point to any action I do. I woke up last week and the realization hit me that I haven't felt happiness in so years. I can't even remember the last time I was happy. I have no hobbies besides playing video games, music, and drawing. I have a very hard time relating to others and forming meaningful connections. I don't really want to die or kill myself, but I don't really feel like existing. I'm tired of living in this world. The last week I've just spent my days staring at a bottle of pills I know could end it. I'm honestly terrified of dying. But I feel like I don't have anything to look forward to. I'm trapped, just floating around waiting for something to happen. I can't see myself in three years now that I think about it. I'm not a bad person, I'm just difficult to care for. I haven't had a meaningful conversation in over a year or two. I guess I'm just wondering if anyone ever feels this. I'm not diagnosed with anything, but I don't feel like this is normal. Does anyone have any advice? I feel like I'm utterly unlovable. I really wish I wasn't born most days. ",0

I hate myself. I hate where I am in life. I hate that I know it’s not going anywhere from here. I hate myself for being nothing. I hate what my life has become. I hate the person I’ve turned into.

I hate myself for being this person. I hate the way I treat the people I love. I hate how I can’t give the people I love basic affection. I hate myself for wanting that affection and not being capable of bringing myself to accept/ reciprocate it. I hate myself for allowing it to get this way. I hate myself for not knowing how to not be the way I am. I hate myself for being aware of all these things. And I hate myself for knowing I’m never going to be able to fix myself. So yeah it’s repetitive… but I really hate myself… ,0

Alone depressed Anyone What's the point of going on like this Nobody's my real friend ,0
39/F- Idk if I’m depressed. Medicine and talking doesn’t help how I feel. I’m sad most of the time where I can’t remember being happy. Idk if it’s just my brain or if my life does suck. I look at social media and I see lots of tragic  stuff and think well my life isn’t that bad… and then I have conflict at home with my kids or their father… and I just get right back thinking I’m so tired of getting everything wrong. I think think think… and I still do the wrong things. Is it depression when u think everybody hates u and ur not good enough? I can’t handle it when i hurt peoples feelings… I can’t handle when they tell me I did something to hurt their feelings. I feel attacked a lot. When people are distant to me I feel like it’s my fault somehow. I get easily overwhelmed and I get frustrated with my kids and I feel like I screwed up my first two sons. Now I have a toddler with another father. Who helped me with them but their real dad doesn’t believe in meds and therapy so we never got the help with their issues. Both dads feel like the kids just needed discipline. The first two kids have adhd. And I’ve always been told I’m too nice. They’re doing a lot of reckless things and I fear they will end up dead or in jail. Then I have a toddler… i decided to plan a pregnancy with my bf at the time. A constant cheater 🤦🏽‍♀️ I don’t even remember why I thought this would be a good idea. Because I thought he was a narcissistic abuser. He kept cheating. And I have been miserable with and without him…. I regret making the baby because now the father feels like we have to keep contact. Then said well I think our son needs us both living together in order to have a fighting chance and be diff than ur other kids… and then recently he was diagnosed with Autism. It was a sad stressful pregnancy… so idk. Idk if it’s just my life is full of reasons to be depressed or if I’m being a cry baby or a snowflake. The dr’s diagnosed me with depression but I think I have ADHD or maybe I’m autistic too…. They won’t evaluate me for ADHD or Autism because I’m too old. ,0

It's fucking embarrassing. I wanna tell my therapist to fuck the fuck off. I'm so fed up with her fucking .. right? Riiiight.? . riiiight? Riiiight?. Blah blah blah riiiight? Blahblahbkah riiiight? Every god damn. 3 words she has to put the word RIIIGHT? at the end of everything and it drives me absolutely fucking insane Why can't I just say. "" Look I'm done"" and hang the fuck up and not have to deal with these fucks anymore. Why do I have to make an appointment to close my case and sign 30 pieces of paper stating that I am quitting? I fucking hate this system. I just want out without being made to feel like the complete piece of shit that I am. I'm a grown ass adult. I may not act like one but I am. But I'm being treated like a god damn 8 year old. I'm fed up. I just want out! I'm laying here in bed. Dreading therapy. It's in a few hours. And the last thing I wanna do is attend. Yet again. I'm getting pissed off and it's ruining my day. Not that I'm having any sort of pleasant day. But this shit is make it me wanna dive off the deep end into an empty pool. ",0

"My coworker and I thought friend just told me basically that I’m draining being around me is hard and my attitude is probably why I don’t have anyone who cares. That everyone always asks him what’s wrong with me. I fucking hate my job I’m always getting yelled at by people for others mistakes no body appreciates that I work essentially by myself overnights and I’m angry at life. I think he’s right but I don’t know how to completely change who I am. I know I have problems with anger but I feel like I’ve just been fucked over by people my whole life. At this point my brain is basically rotten and maybe it would be okay to just put myself out of my misery. I have struggled with wanting to be dead for as long as I can remember, and I just don’t feel like I really have much left in me. I feel fucking lonely and alienated from really everyone, just background, only there out of obligation to others so they don’t feel sad not because I really want to be. My own mother can really only handle me in doses. I was born dead and I can’t believe I was brought back just to be like this. I feel guilty about being alive when all I want to be is dead, yet knowing there are so many people out there that want the life I want to give away. ",0
"Hello everyone,I've been struggling with depression lately, and it's been really hard to manage. No matter what I do, I can't shake off this overwhelming sadness. For instance, even when I accomplish something good, I still feel deeply sad, almost as if I want to disappear. It's confusing because some days are objectively good, yet I find myself feeling inexplicably down.Everything seems empty, and I feel like I have to constantly put on a facade, as if nothing can truly make me happy anymore. I can't seem to understand why this is happening, and it feels like I never will. Is there something wrong with me? I really don't know. If anyone has any advice or solutions, I'm ready to listen.

"I think my mum has depression or something because she doesnt know how to look after herself and i dont know what to do because im moving out in a month and i dont want to have to give up going to university because of her, but i still want her to be okay so im just really confused.she doesn't ever tell me when she is feeling ill or if somethings wrong either so i might be missing some stuff but she does a lot of stuff that I dont know how to help with and I feel like with me gone and her alone she wont be able to look after herself, like she cant hang clothes properly and she doesnt really do things like leave the house or shower often which i know might be a lot to say but I dont know im just so worried about her and i feel like a failure or something for not being able to help. Ive thought about hiring a carer but even if i get a job when i move out i know that chances are i would barely be able to afford one for her, especially since they would be really expensive but I just need someone who would take her out of the house and help make sure that she gets out of her room and looks after herself. She never goes out of her way to talk to me or my sister either, she only really asks us for money for herself since she smokes a lot and spends a lot of it on that, and I dont know how to get her to stop smoking without sending her to some kind of rehabilitation centre but I dont know how I would do that or afford that in the ukshe lost her car a few weeks ago and hasnt left the house in a really long time either, so I believe she has depression but she doesn't want to go outside and shes really scared of going to the doctors or the GP so im not sure how I am going to get her professional help maybe i can get a therapist to visit her at home? Im sorry im just really lost I still want to go to university in September but im so worried about her and I really want her to be okay when I move out but I dont know what to do or how to help her at all.

"I got diagnosed with MDD, Anxiety w ocd symptoms and PTSD. I have no friends. All the friends I had were either from highschool and I moved away from my home state anyways which means I haven’t seen my family in years nor do I have the money to get on a plane to see them. I don’t have the motivation to pour into my old hobbies nor the money to get into new ones I might enjoy. I hate every job I find myself working at. I have no dream job. I’m socially awkward to a disgusting degree. I find most social situations to feel like improv. Forced to act right in the moment. I always try to feel out other people’s personality and adjust to what they’d like so I’m always exhausted and anxious and disconnected from social interactions. I’m off medication because it was messing with my body. I get high everyday because I usually desire the feeling of happiness even if it’s not authentic. I spent a lot of my free time almost in pain at how mundane life is, how cruel and disgusting it is, how I’m always so vulnerable in new relationships platonic or otherwise and people can smell it on me. Which is why I have no friends now. I had a best friend who broke the worst boundaries someone can break so there goes years of friendship down the drain. I have a boyfriend but I don’t always want him to see how much I hate being alive so I’ve stopped talking to him as much about my feelings. I feel trapped inside this life because I know that if I ended my own misery it would cause misery to the people I love, I guess I really just have my immediate family and my bf. But I can’t justify it. But I also want a release from this life. I don’t even believe in God anymore so I don’t have faith for better. I believe in luck now. And I’m not lucky and I don’t think the cards I was given set me up for a good game but I’m forced to keep playing it even though I hardly enjoy it. And I don’t even have the energy to fix my face anymore. To not look completely dead or show my anger or my sadness. Which leads to problems at work. I’ve given up on even trying to get people to like me I don’t talk to a soul. Even though I want to be liked. I feel so different. And so odd. And trapped in a life that I already know I don’t want. I wish there was a way of escape without devastating the people I love. But I rather live in misery than bring it upon them. I just wish I didn’t have to live in misery.",0

"One of the main sources of my depression since early childhood.  My father left my mother when I was 3 weeks old.  He cheated on her and is now married to the woman he cheated with, which is our stepmom.  As part of the divorce it was arranged that we visit our father every other weekend.  On these weekends, he would wine and dine us with video games, movies, and restaurants...nothing we would ever experience in our mother's home.  It was genuinely a good time and carefree but shortlived and hollow at the same time as he would simply pack us up and drop us off like luggage when the weekend was over.  Upon returning home, my mother, mostly silent would be doing the dishes In mostly dark house and I can remember just sinking into depression thinking about her loneliness and being left with 3 kids to raise on her on.  There was very little fun in my mother's household and I don't know if I can blame her.  I have to believe she did the best she could even though she could be abusive at times.  Being a male often wondered why I wasn't placed with my dad, instead I was in a house of all females (2 older sisters) and always the odd man out.  I had to watch my step brother grow up with the childhood I should've had.  I wanted to play football, not allowed.  I wanted to play an instrument, not allowed.  All these things left me predisposed to depression so when my friend committed suicide I spiraled into a deep depression alongside substance abuse because I didn't want to live anymore either.  I've never brought up my jealousy or resentments to my father and always just stuff it inside.  I'm 45 bow so it really doesn't matter but the depression and I'm wondering what I can do to heal these cycles life has burdened me with.  I have a reason to live but depression threatens all my goals.  Thanks if you've read this far any words of wisdom are appreciated.",0

"Hello everyone,I want to share my situation and get some advice. My main language is Spanish, and I'm about to finish my senior year in the US. I was born and raised in Mexico until I was 8 years old. My family moved to the US mainly because of the poor economy in Tijuana at the time. I learned English and continued my life here, but I always noticed that being an immigrant without papers comes with many limitations.A couple months ago, I talked to my parents about the possibility of returning to Mexico to finish college. I want to become either a doctor or a nurse, and college in the US is too expensive and difficult to get into. In Mexico, not only is it cheaper, but I can also attend a very prestigious medical school.Here's the thing: I'm scared. I'm afraid of ruining my life by returning. I would live with my grandparents in a decent, wealthy part of Tijuana, but I'm not the brightest student. This last junior year was my worst, getting Ds and Cs. I'm not sure about the process or what I need to do. I don't know what to do, and I'm scared of it. I know I don't have much time left, but I want to do something with my life.

"I’m so lost and nothing has helpedIm a 21 year old male and I’ve had major depression since I was 7, and recently diagnosed with ADHD and bipolar last year.

I have little to no social life, I don’t really hang out with anyone, no one talks to me. Even if they did I wouldn’t know what to do because I have such shit social skills. I am a terrible eater and constantly eat stuff that’s bad for me leading to me gaining quite a lot of weight.

"Hi, this is me counting down the days of my life. i probably would be gone soon and I kinda want to tell my story to anyone who had the time to read. This is the summary of my 27 years on earth.At the age of 5, my parents separated - mostly because of me. My father is a deadbeat truck driver who would mostly beat up my mother because there is no more sugar for his coffee. I would often witness him throwing the empty tupperware at my mom when they quarrel. I don't know if they knew though, as they would mostly leave me at the care of my maternal aunts and close our house when this happen. No one said anything. Even I, thought it was normal for them to fight. So when my mother left and went to the capital city to find work (we were living at the province that time and my mom is a teacher), I wasn't surprised. I was used to being left with my maternal aunts and basically had no close relationship with my mom back then. I was even closer to my father. Then, that happened. It might actually be the straw that broke the camel's back when it came to my parents' relationship. I was a mischievous child and I liked going to the water pump with my friends to bathe. It might be my bad timing, or the fact that my mom had just left, or maybe my dad was too drunk, or the fact that I was literally a child, but at that time, my father got mad with me. Like mad angry. He chased me from the water pump with his belt and layed it down on me until we reached our house. I don't remember much after that, but I remember it was a whole debacle. I was bruised all over for asking my dad for a fckin shampoo sachet. I was five.Later, I remember my father apologizing to me. But really, what can a five year old understand from that apology? He told me it was my fault, that I was naughty, and I annoyed him to the point he raised his hands on me. And at this point, I've always been close with my father, so when he ""made me understand"" that it was my fault and ""apologized"", I really accepted that. Maybe I'm at fault. Maybe I was the problem. Maybe I deserved getting beaten because I asked him for a fckin shampoo. I then learned that one of my mom's cousin reported the incident to her, and the next few months were a blur. I moved with my older brother who was 8 years older than me, my mom's cousin (the one who reported the incident), and my mom's younger brother, to the capital with my mother. Then, I had a semblance of somewhat of a normal childhood, but I would still be left alone most of the time.I understood, and I don't really blame my mother for anything. She was already trying her best to provide for us and make ends meet. I know this for a fact, and coupled with the fact that I still blamed myself for my parents' ultimate separation, I seldom asked for anything and kept everything to myself. I would mostly just do my own thing. I was often left in the care of my maternal aunts. And I was wasn't close with my brother - first of all, the age gap, second of all, I felt my brother's hostility to me. I knew he also blamed me for our parents' separation and uprooting our lives. My brother is already in highschool at that time so I don't blame him.Then, I fell in love with writing. I fell in love with books and being able to create a world of your own where everything just falls into place. It became my outlet, my secret garden. And I apparently had a talent for that. I became an active part of the journalism club when I was in elementary and highschool. I even competed and won in writing competitions. I also became editor-in-chief of our school publication. I was smart. I was good with maths and science, and never had a failing grade. I had a talent with words, I was good with my hands, an artist, and even joined the school band as a drummer. Aside from these, I was even part of leadership roles in school and graduated as Vice-president of student council. These achievements carried me to the peak of my school days and also became my downfall.I was labeled as ""that child"". You know the one with good grades and the one every teacher liked. But no one really liked me. I was ostracized for having a speech disability - I was born with cleft lip and palate. Out of jealousy, one of my classmate, and my ""bestfriend"" when I was in elementary scribbled a not-so-nice slur on my test paper. A test I had perfected. It turned out to be a big debacle, and I found out that my classmates never liked me. The ""friends"" I thought I have never truly appreciated and accepted me for who I am.But I was naive. I wanted to be accepted. I started hosting elaborate sleepovers just to hangout with friends. I will often go home late at night because I'm hanging out in someone's house. I even started to force myself to people because I wanted to find somewhere I belonged. It backfired I think, because the more I wanted to be accepted, the more people rejected my company. I had this fiery and stubborn personality and I think this just added to the repulsion. When it finally dawned on me that these people never liked me, and kinda accepted that, it was the end of my highschool. By then, I don't have any friends. I don't have any real connections to anyone. I turned to anime, online games and social media, and actually got accepted to related communities. I actually made friends who actually liked me for who I am, and I was genuinely happy.It was different in the real world though. The more I gained friends online, the more I lost touch with reality. My relationship with my family also worsened. Because I was labeled as ""that child"", I was often compared with my brother and my cousins. Hence, you can understand the hostility. The only ""friends"" I had were the ones which were forced by circumstances. I would often find myself forcing a relationship, but it wouldn't work out in the end, so even now, I still grieve all those wasted effort.Because I was labeled as ""that child"", there were a lot of expectations on me when I entered college. But the thing is, I never wanted to be ""that child"". I wanted to be a normal person, not someone who apparently became ""successful"" by overcoming their disability. I don't want that kind of burden. I never wanted that kind of burden. I was not that child. I'm just me. I only wanted to be accepted somewhere. I only wanted to be accepted by someone. So then, I failed. I failed my classes. I got a failing grade in one of my major subject and almost failed the others. And you know what happened? I was honestly relieved. I was no longer ""that child"". But the reaction of the people around me were different. Some rejoiced and gloated at me, others, like my mom was thoroughly disappointed. And then I realized, ahhh, all this time, I was ""that child"". The irony.All this time I had been escaping that label, and when I finally escaped, I realized that my only purpose is to be ""that child"". So, I felt useless. I felt this kind of despair that every thing I did was useless. I am useless. I'm so useless to the point that I am so powerless in proving my identity. I am not me. I am ""that child"". Because everything has been getting onto me, I brought up the topic of mental health with my mom and told her that I need a break from school because I might have depression. She told me that it's all just in my head, and that I'm just irresponsible for not managing my time and my life correctly. So, it was again my fault. I had to be that child. If not ""that child"" then who am I? So I did. I transferred at a local collage, continued my studies in something I don't like and donned the identity of ""that child"". For another 4 years, I had this mask, and I think it worked. I became ""that child"". I made new relationships and I genuinely thought I finally found somewhere I belonged. Despite for the fact that there's always this hollow feeling in my chest -- It's screaming, this is not me. I'm not ""that child"". Why do I have to do this? But if I am not ""that child"" then who am I? I finally found people who accepted ""that child"", if they knew that I'm not ""that child"", then I'll be left alone again. So, I silenced that voice.And because I pretended to be ""that child"", I passed both civil service exam and my board exam on the same year I graduated. I even graduated with honors and as president of our department. Throughout my years in the leadership position, I also helped my classmates in thesis preparation, helped my underclassmen through math tutorials and actually built myself back up. Even before graduating, I was already on the running to a position at my dream job in the national government. A few days after passing the civil service exam, I got a call from my dream job and signed a contract and started that same day. Things are finally looking up to me because I became ""that child"".Eventually, I got a permanent position and things just went downhill. It's true that the light is the brightest before it goes out. I tried so hard to be ""that child"" even in my job, and what do you know? I did excelled. I excelled so much to the point that expectations just kept piling up, responsibilities kept piling up, everything kept piling up. And I was burned out, I can only go so far with keeping up this fake identity. I dedicated everything to be excellent in what I do, but the jar is broken. No matter how much water I put it, it still leaked. I finally had an opportunity to consult a doctor because I had my own money now. And I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. Because of this the things I built crumbled and eventually my job was affected, my relationships were affected, my health was affected, and now, I'm alone again.I have no job. I had to quit my dream job because everything is just too much. The disdain my director had for me plagues my nights, and I can't even begin with the eyes and whispers of my coworkers. They didn't take too kindly that the usual passionate and hardworking coworker had exhausted her fire.I have no friends. I only had a relationship with people because I was ""that child"". I helped a lot of people, even connected jobs to them but no one reached out. I have no family. My mother wants to disown me because I'm no longer ""that child"". My brother never cared for me and remains hostile because I had always been ""that child"". My family members are hostile to me because I was ""that child"". There are a lot of underlying issues and even now, my mother blames me for not having relationship with any of her family members. They don't believe in depression, they say it's all just in your head.Even if I want to get help with my mental health I don't have any means to support myself. I live alone and even my bills are now piling up. Everytime I open up to someone, they always just say that they had worse and that I just need to go out more, or go to church. They tell me that I am not depressed, it's all in my head. And the thing is, I'm kind of convinced at this point that this all just in my head. I'm just irresponsible, I'm just lazy, I'm just sad. And now, I'm honestly tired. I want to beg God for another chance in life, you know, one of those isekai tropes.At this point, I'm just broken beyond repair. I've already been ""that child"" my whole life and built everything I had in that identity. The thing is, I'm not ""that child"", I never was. It was like a character in this game called life that I made in order to complete quests. And now that it's game over, I realized that this character is flawed. This is the story of ""that child"" who lived for 27 years. I feel like this is my last cry to the universe for help. People around me used to tell me that I only need to say something if I need help and they will help me. The thing is, I did. But no one listened. If there's someone out there who can genuinely help me, please, I'm desperate.I don't have the courage to start again, but I also don't have the courage to take my own life. So, I've been starving myself. I don't harm myself outwardly because people will notice and raise questions, and honestly, I'm too tired for any confrontations. At this rate, I might die before the year ends.I will take my life on the last day of the year, I don't know, I might not actually make it. I plan to take these last few months to prepare myself, like a countdown of sorts. I plan to finish trivial matters in the coming months so that when I eventually leave before the new year countdown, I know I had no lingering matters.Deep down, there's a voice in me that still wanted to live. The same one I silenced a long long time ago. But that voice may just be in my head. I don't know.I guess this is goodbye. I just want for someone to know my story that's why I'm posting here. I pray for you who had read this far, I genuinely thank you for reading my story. See you in the afterlife? Just kidding 😂",0
"Going to talk to my doctor today but I’m still Wondering if anyone here has switched from ADHD stimulants to an antidepressant? How was your experience? I hate how closely depression, ADHD and anxiety mimic each other.

Can it be that Anti Depressants working for a family member will also work for me? I think its exhausting to try different medication until you find one that works and am now hoping that what works for my sister will also work for me.

"i think i'll die early. i'm just starting out this new chapter in my life having recently graduated college, but i feel like there's no point in that. my friends and everyone else are excited to be taking on their respective career paths and have dreams of cars and houses, all that stuff, but i feel so dissatisfied with my life. i want none of those material things, i want something more from life and i keep looking for it and the more i look for it the more i get depressed, i have a certain yearning/longing for something I couldn't really name and it's eating me up and i'm unhappy. god knows i try to be happy, i do whatever the fuck ppl suggest i do including not thinking about being depressed, but can i help it? no. i feel helpless and at the same time i feel hopeful, does that make sense? i still feel like I won't live very long and that i'm not meant to be here any longer. i've done a lot of things, but they never sufficed. ive done worthwhile things, i volunteered, i finished college, joined school clubs, etc., which never really made me have a sense of belongingness. ive been eager to help other people, but i cannot even help myself.",0

"I feel cursed to just be miserable, every interest passion or dream I had as a child is dead. I grew up in love with literature and comic books and content and writing stories, drawing, learning things. But now i just seem to be waiting for death to take me. I don’t enjoy the process of making anything anymore, I never had any creative energy or talent, i don’t see a point in trying if you will never be proud of anything you create or be happy doing it. I will never be able to satisfy my expectation of a good….anything. I’m never going to experience what it’s like to be even mediocre at a task. I’m hanging myself",0
For context I’m someone who is suffering from severe anxiety and depression and want to take some antidepressants but am worried about its effect on my daydreaming and overall imagination as I can’t do that much anymore as my daydreams aren’t vivid anymore and are more just vague pictures In my head rather than full on detailed movies and I’m worried that if I take any antidepressants that it’ll kill off whatever is left of my daydreaming/imagination abilities overall. Did the antidepressants you guys took kill off your daydreaming completely or did the opposite effect happen to where it made it worse or more vivid than before? ,0

"For about a year and a half I have been going through depression cycles with them getting worse with no end in sight and it’s all my fault.

A few weeks went by with my class mates teasing us and asking us both to just try it at first she said no then one day around January or February my friend that bought it up asked her with me not around and apparently she said “I would give him a chance if he talked to me” those were the exact words he said and I being stupid not trusting any1 (because of heavy bullying in years prior/trust issues with new people) said no and ever since that day I have regretted saying no and saying she was ugly behind her back then another day that week every time I looked at her there was a beautiful aura around her every time I seen her I fell more in love and it has broke me knowing that I probably blew my chance with her without knowing it and every day since that one fateful day in January I have had a overwhelming regret and sadness, sadness that had consumed my life I stoped going out with friends playing with friends and stoped loving my self and I don’t think I can take it anymore soon I might just become a “I wish he told us how he felt” memory and I do t even recognize my self anymore but I still keep up the happy and peaceful act in school and around family but I feel it slipping and I don’t want to hurt the ones closest by leaving so soon I have a full life ahead of me but I only want her in my life even if she leaves me more hurt than ever. thanks for reading I guess… don’t be stupid like me no one deserves what I feel every day live a good and full one even if I cut mine short and remember you can be better",0

When I was younger I used to be more confident but now that I’m older I’m so insecure it affects my daily life and makes me very depressed. I know people say to delete all social media but it’s so difficult to do that honestly I look at things that I know will trigger me it’s like kinda a form a self harm I guess just seeing people talk about certain things or making fun of a certain body type I know it’ll bother me. No matter how much I work out it doesn’t help and I feel like my body is never ever good enough it honestly makes me wanna just end it because there’s nothing more I want in life to be wanted and accepted. ,0
"To start off I'm diagnosed with both severe anxiety and depression since age 9 but i think it has recently gotten a lot worse.  Im 16 and i cant get out of bed for most of the day, the idea of getting up and seeing my family makes me feel sick.  I wait till everyone goes to bed so i can actually eat food and clean the house.  The house is also part of the issue, i stuggle with getting anything done because I'll just walk into a room and see the mess and it sressed out that i just want to cry.  I ghosted all my friends because i cant get myself to talk to them, its like theres a wall in my brain that i cant push through. I hate going outside because other people just irritate me and make me close to a breakdown. Every week i feel like im getting worse and worse, i feel frozen and stuck in a endless cycle that only stops when my entire family is out of the house for a few hours.         I hope for some advice or to hear if others have gone through a similar thing, i would get a therapist but we cant find any available for new patients.",0

I thought love could save me but now I lost that too. I am high functioning, yet no one knows what I am going through and how much effort pretending to be normal takes.

"To give some context, I am very shy and have never had a conversation even close to romantic with a woman. For the last few years, I sometimes feel depressed and feel like a failure when I see attractive women.

I've never been bullied, have great parents, and I am content with my appearance. I think I know why this is happening: I am attributing my self-worth to my success with women, which is causing me to become depressed. But how am I supposed to fix this? No matter what, I just feel incredibly lonely all the time. I've also heard that it's not good to get into a relationship to ""fill a void"" but I'm not sure what else to do.

"Every thing I do now, I think, you just did that to get attention. I cut myself on my arm, ""you just did that so that people would notice and pay attention to you"" I cut myself on my other arm, ""You just want more attention, you just want people to look at you"", I cut myself on my upper arm, so that it would be hidden by my sleeve, ""You wanted attention though, that's all you wanted, for people to look at you"" When I talked to my brother and dad about my depression, I could only think afterwords, you don't care what they think, you just want to make yourself the victim, I've even came up with a suicide plan and I told my therapist and my dad, and I only thought, ""you would never actually have the balls to pull the trigger, so theres no reason to event tell them, the only reason why you did that is so that they'd give you more attention"".

"A few nights ago I had some really strong rum like 40% it was a little less than half left , before I did that night, at that point I was already drinking 5% Smirnoff for weeks, like at 4/5 each night before bed then some times I’d just drink all day so by the time as I got this drink I was feeling like it would be nothing because I was feeling tolerant, and whiles drinking it and I drank the rest of the 40% straight from the bottle I was fine and I was even looking for more, by time as I went to bed though I felt like I had poisoning I had all the symptoms threw up every second had the runs barely could’ve breathe like just taking short breathes couldn’t breathe and really was feeling out of it I felt I could’ve fainted , my body was aching so bad , and just tried to see what I could do if I drank water it made me like so that’s what I did then I remembered that day I didn’t eat so on top of the drink I didn’t eat so I was really gone , the next day I was dealing with the symptoms all day felt like it would not stop, it has been a few days now things are better but my body still aches and my throat aches from the throwing up all that time and violently, I discovered that based on how much you drink and your tolerance alcohol can send you away whiles your unconscious like sleeping, I still feel these side effects and with my life and how it goes , I would be so happy if I can go in my sleep aside from a gun or anything else painless and quick sleep would be the best, I’m so done with everything I really am I want God to please put me to rest forever please God please , why did I have to live like this why does my mother hate me I want to go , and lay in Gods embrace I feel like it’s warm like a pillow, every time I think about him and my situation he’s the only person I can ever trust I know there would be no doubt that he would not want to ruin me , God is all loving, I want to feel his warmth, I know it feels amazing and I know you would feel heard and understood by him there’s no hope here but I can have hope following him, come for me God please come, I sometimes don’t understand why he leaves me , why bring me to you God instead.

"I was doing so good. I have my project car, and I replaced a starter, worked with dad replacing the fuel pump, diagnosed electrical. I kayaked, studied grammar, read Faulkner, cleaned my car, talked to my family. I felt on top of the world this weekend. I cut off my ex because I saw she was with another man. I accepted it, accepted she often wasn’t nice to me, and that I could move on and I was not ugly, or stupid, or less a man. But depression is back after a hiatus, a little climb to normalcy, and a slide back down the emotional ski slope. The regret is hitting me, and the brain fog, and all those nasty thoughts (you can imagine what they are) associated with depression. All back again, in the waves I’m familiar with. It’s back again starting tonight for who knows how long. She broke me down so bad four months ago. It’s broken me as a man. I don’t have the same drive anymore. I don’t know how I’ll survive grad school when I go back. I’ve bombed four interviews, and I’ve just been stuck half-assing at my little cube job. Why is depression in waves? Why does it have to come back every time?I’m just going to watch YouTube until I can sleep. Back on autopilot at work tomorrow.",0

I know I was all over the place here but I'd appreciate any advice.Thank you",0
"I have found that since becoming a parent, I am much more sensitive to overstimulation and absolutely snapping. I have suffered from depression for most of my life but manage my symptoms enough to survive with the help of Wellbutrin. My depression tends to manifest as rage and intense anger. Regularly having to repeat myself and deal with my 6 and 4 year old constantly fighting, wanting to play outside with neighbors and get into what they shouldn’t get into is leaving me feeling completely depleted. I almost always end up yelling and it’s increasingly including swearing which upsets my husband. I feel so sad and ashamed; I know they are kids being kids but the noise and chaos is literally killing me from the inside out. Is there ever light at the end of this seemingly endless tunnel? I am absolutely exhausted. I am desperate for any suggestions on how to handle overstimulation and intense anger as a result of my depression. ",0
You ever enjoy something but your brain says let’s enjoy this when you feel better but you end up never feelings better so you just avoid it for years. I do this and I hate it . I enjoy games but the way my life is I can’t play them because I want to save them for when I’m in a happy place . But I’m never in a happy place. Even simply watching a YouTuber I enjoy if I enjoy it too much I start unconsciously avoiding it. ,0

"People don’t actually care. They never do. All they want is for me to do a silly song and dance, and be the joke that gives them a quick laugh, then move on with their day, never thinking about me again afterwards. They wouldn’t actually care if I were to off myself, they’d probably feel a bit inconvenienced or bummed out for a week or two, then move on and never think about me again. Nobody actually cares, everyone only ever cares about themselves. I have no agency in my own life, all I am is a background character. It doesn’t matter. I don’t matter. It just hurts, and I’m screaming into the void",0

"when i wake up, and realize i have to suffer the idea of living theres this big pit in my stomach. Im so overwhelmed with living im so overwhelmed with life and my problems, my only ways to escape are DayDreaming and sleeping. Everytime i close my eyes are the only times i feel a sense of peace. Its too overwhelming how much i just want to kill myself. Everything is to much, and i dont even know who i am anymore. My brain fog has maybe be forget everything, my dissoication made everything not real , and my OCD, well what has my OCD not done. I dream about being around people, and i dream about a past lover. I miss school so much, it was the only distraction i had to my problems. Now its gone, and im moving into to highschool. Were im going to meet new people. Yet, im not excited. My cousin who goes to that school tells me everything, the words people say the things that they do its pure filth. I dont know what to do anymore. I just want to fucking die. ",0
"hey i think everyone has felt this but i hate myself. i have a failed attempt and have been clean from selfharm for a month.firstly, i struggle mentally but lately it has been physically affecting me. i feel nauseous and have vomited various times on how anxious i have been. i dry heave when i feel anxious and it has an impact on my appetite. i can never eat when im sad and when i mean sad i mean my emotions run all over me negatively. i have both mommy and daddy issues. i havent told my family this yet, i dont feel like i can open up to them.. some reason talking to strangers who dont know you feels better.i really need help. i have been in counselling before and in my opinion they do not help. they tell me i should do 'this' and 'that' after telling them i cant because i feel like im gonna puke or breakdown.finally, getting out of my bedroom and cleaning is so hard.  i dont remember the last time ive cleaned my bedroom. i struggle getting out of bed and spend around 2 to 4 hours in my bed after waking up, doing nothing. the rest is just me on my computer or phone listening to music, haven't showered or brush my teeth.. cleaning myself feels nice but i struggle doing it so often. i hate it so much, i hate it. i spend so much time in my room i dont eat because i forget to. when im outside, i starve myself anyways.i dont see what people see in me. iam truly ugly and have no reason to be here. struggling 2 much",0
"I have been in the state for quite sometime now.  I keep going back and forth between active and passive ideation. I think about all the pain and sorrow I'd bring to my family and then I shut it off. But then again I feel super miserable. There isn't a single thing I'd point at but all in all my life has been a let down and I am partly to be blamed. Even so I cannot help but notice how if certain things hadn't take place I would just be doing fine. I wish things were a bit compensating in my case. I fell apart so many times at leat my perseverance could be taken into notice just to cut me some slack. But to my utter dismay, things were never not easy. I have researched a lot about ways to kms and have only come to realise that dying is just as, if not more difficult than living. Each morning I wake up with this heaviness in my chest and feel disappointed that here's another day. I don't understand what I should do anymore. I do not wish to continue living but at the same time it is immenswly difficult to get the whole kms thing right. I am in this limbo that I just can't seem to escape.I have been depressed for a better part of my life but sometimes I gaslight myself into thinking maybe it isn't all that bad and I am just making things up. Even now I don't know how to justift why I don't want to continue, I just know that I don't. I have literally no friends I can turn to (mostly because of my inability to keep people around), I have never felt good enough for anything and I am also quite insecure about my looks. I have no social life. I am not at all ambitious. I don't see a future for myself. ",0
"I've got no sense of job security and not enough savings to even weather the gap between losing my job and unemployment benefits kicking in.

It was like I was testing new designs of circuit boards, or pre-shipment testing of current designs, or putting together proof of concept, prototype sort of things. Too bad all three of those things are going the way of repairs.I'm at the point where everything I own may be lost. When I don't have any people to attach to.

Im a new college student studying in another country. I found it hard when i first got here but that has slowly improved and i thought i was settling in just fine. I have had anxiety and depression issues in the past. But then all of a sudden i have started to feel sad all the time. I miss my mother all the time. I cant help but cry all the time. I just dont know how to be happy anymore. And i dont have anyone in my life to share these feelings with. So if anyone has any advice for me i would be very grateful. Something like cheap online therapy oprions. Im a broke college student so conventional therapy isnt a option. Please help. I have anxiety attacks about everything i worry over every little thing. Cant eat cant sleep. Im throwing up what little i can force my self to eat. If anyone has any advice on what to do i will be very very grateful. Ps im studying medicine. ,0
Anything really that helps rewire the sadness that eats me,0
Idk the last time I've felt any kind of hope. I'm such a worthless and hopeless individual. I do nothing all day because I'm too anxious and scared to do anything worthwhile. Therapy's never helped. Neither has outpatient. What else am I supposed to do other than kill myself? I just feel so alone with these thoughts.,0
I’m dealing with so much shame and guilt that I want to kms.I grew up always feeling like I’m The problem. Even being surrounded by family and friends I’ve always felt it would be better if I wasn’t there. After 8th grade I started going through a downward spiral and after 10th grade I started getting into drugs to cope. Right after highschool I unintentionally did something horrible and once the law stepped in my parents finally realized I needed them. I feel like that’s the worse part. I wanted to just kill myself but I couldn’t put the pain on them. Everyone but the law seemed to excuse what I did.Five years later and I still want to kill myself. I’m currently in a rehabilitation program and going through the process of “healing”. They’ve helped me realize what I did and what caused me to do it. How to cope with emotions and how to not do anything like it again. All my friends like me. My friends like me. My coworkers like me. Everything in my life “seems well” “seems normal” but it’s not. Not inside. I don’t like me. I don’t like my self for what I did. I wish I could go back and change things but I can’t. I feel like I’m being eating from the inside out for what I did. No one reminds me but me. There will be times where I don’t think about it. But then all the guilt and shame comes back like cancer. I’ll try to hate the world but deep down I only hate myself. I just want to end it. ,0

"From the highest highs to the lowest lows. All within 3 or 4 days.How the hell do you function.I've been through a breakup. 9 years gone, poof, dissappeared...It's 11 months ago now and I'm still struggling. Want her back, don't want her back, hate her, miss her, know it's better for both of us, think it's her that left, realise it was mutual.....All over the show.And now all I want to do is rebuild my life. Alone. And I have such amazing opportunities in front of me. I'm healthy, I have the best job in the world, I have money in the bank, no kids that live with me, an awesome teenage lad that I want to share life with and show him the world, I'm fit and still young enough and good looking enough I think...And yet I have so much I want to do and achieve and I can't make myself do it all. I do the bare minimum.....train, eat ok most of the time and work as much as possible so I stay ahead financially and have options....I'm in such a good position, and yet yesterday I tied a noose and all I had to do was step off the chair and it would all be over.Now today, I'm happier.Man how the fuck do you cope with these emotions and ups and downs.I rotted in bed till 12 today. Got up and did all my training. Felt really good after spa and sauna and thought fuck it I'ma have a drink and some shit food because I feel good now and start being the machine tomorrow.But it's not part of the plan that is me being a fucking machine all the time and becoming my absolute best self....But it's not so bad....I feel at peace with it right now.Random rambly post I know....",0
"Well here i am a 27 year old guy, i feel like i am unlovable, i just want to matter to someone but 27 years i have not been able to, yes i have had relationships before but non that lasted. So here i am still alone sad depressed wanting to die. It doesn't help that al the girls i always fall for never seem to have any feelings for me, heck they probably wouldn't even care if i died right now. I just feel so sad, im not that good looking, and people would consider me the nice guy, my friends who are already getting married always try to cheer me up and tell me it will be okay but it doesn't help when everyone is getting on with their lives and i just feel like im stuck. I want to move forward with someone and have the hole marriage and children thing, its something i look most forward to in life but now it feels like that's something i will never have. Its not like i can't talk to girls, i actually can have very good conversation with woman its just that they never see me in that way. Maybe something is wrong with my personality or my looks, maybe this is the way it is ment to be because i also feel like im not really a good peson even tho people tell me i am but i have many regrets in life. I am a Christian and i know im a sinner i have done bad deeds and i feel like im a monster and this is my punishment. Please forgive me and i wish that someone would love me. ",0
"this is going to be a long post, and i know nobody is going to see this, much less read it for that matter but idc atpim not even supposed to be living right. im an accident, a mistake. i don't even know my own father. all i know about him is that he is/was an illegal mexican immigrant and that's it. i don't know his name, history, nothing. and to be honest, the world constantly reminds me that i serve no purpose at all, that im just some blight to be eradicated. i grew up in a poverty ridden household with a mother who was incapable of caring for me properly. fuck, i can't even remember much of these years, probably due to me repressing these awful days. i can hardly recall anything these days. anyways, because of this, my mental growth was stunted significantly. i came from a curious child to becoming timid and withdrawn. little did i know that this would become one of my critically problematic traits up until this day, but i had way more problems to worry about than that at the time. my old home was a constant battlezone of physical and mental abuse. i suppose i have gotten so used to it that i hardly even reacted to it. i was about 2-5ish at this time. i recall having a cat for one year, until she died of poisoning. i saw her die in front of my eyes. the sight of her dying is still engraved into my mind years later.moving onto me finally going into school. i started preschool when i was about 3-4. every other student excluded me from their activities. i wanted to be friends, i wanted to forge a connection with them, i was so desperate to gain any sort of human contact outside of my family. but i was constantly excluded. i used to play by myself because the other kids didn't like me. and the one main question that still comes up every now and again came up: what's wrong with me? a concept that young me was too complex to grasp, but finally came into understanding much later. one girl, however, treated me with kindness, but im not sure if we have ever been friends at all. fast forward to kindergarten. this same girl came with me to kindergarten, but she made new friends and i was essential forgotten about. another student, however, did actually treat me with kindness, just like the previous girl did. but after thinking about this for some time, i think she only did this because her older brother was friends with my older brother (note: all of my siblings that i mention are my half siblings, we don't share a father). of course, she had people whom she'd prefer over me. this is an important aspect in this story that will continuously show up.come first grade, and a new student arrives to our class. i try and make conversation with her, which, to my surprise, she actually takes interest in me. this would be the first friend that i have made in the 6 years i had been alive at the time. i used to look forward to seeing her everyday. we used to hang out on the playground all the time. she had even took an interest in making mud pies with me, which was my favorite activity to do at recess even though id create a mess on my uniform. this, eventually, comes to an end. me and my siblings abruptly move to my older brother's grandparents house for about six months, cutting off my one and only friendship. i had to quickly adjust to the new life that i was so suddenly thrown to. i went to a new school. frankly, it was better than my old school, it was bigger, had better teachers, i got to take a school bus to school (i lived close to my previous school, which didn't require a bus), and the playground was a vast wonderland for 7 year old me. but there was one issue: i wasn't able to click with any of the students. at all. after 6 months, i move back to my city into a place, that i will simply put, call an absolute living hell that i will stay in for 7 years. i swear, that place probably took years off of my life. not like i had that many years anyway, but i digress. i go back to the old school and reunite with my old friend. we go back to hanging out. meanwhile back at home, i finally meet my stepfather, who i will be referring to as satan in this story. satan made my life, as well as the rest of my siblings life an absolute shitshow. i had a good impression of him at first, but as time went on, i realized how evil this guy was. the place that i had moved to was essentially a shoebox of an apartment. hardly any space at all. this apartment was a basement that constantly flooded and had roaches, mice, flies, you name it. i have seen maggots under appliances in that place. because of the constant flooding, we had mold and mildew infiltrate the air. becaus there was hardly any space in there, my siblings had to sleep in the living room. and you can forget about air conditioning; there were no openable windows in there. satan never went outside to smoke, i used to inhale smoke all of the time when i was trying to sleep, and id wake up with my throat hurting. there was no washing machine, so we had to wash dishes on hand or walk 20 minutes to the nearest laundromat. and because of the flooding most of the clothes would smell like mildew for weeks on end. the place hardly got cleaned, and when it did it was because my mother went into a fit about how me and my siblings were dirty even though the whole house was dirty. it made no sense. she and satan used to argue almost all the time, which put a toll on my already diminishing mental state. again, more physical and mental abuse, just like the first residence i was in. i could never get the end of it. i had nowhere to go.while all of this occurred at home, my friend invited me and another friend of her's to a sleepover. this would be my first and only sleepover to date. but when i arrived, she seemed disappointed that the other friend didn't arrive but i did. i thought nothing of it at the time but came to realize that she preferred the other friend over me. and yes, i did have a fun time, but i didn't want to go home. i really didn't want to go home. i wish i lived with my friend but, obviously, this wasn't possible. while i was gone, my siblings had messed with my stuff, going thru my things and the like. i was obviously upset but nothing was ever done about it. after the end of 2nd grade, my only friend leaves, never to return. once third grade begins is when the real downfall begins.i don't really remember much from 3rd-5th grade other than the fact that i was bullied by basically my whole class. i was even bullied by the teachers. the main reason was for being ugly. i was practically tormented during these years. i tried talking to my parents, teachers, counselor, anybody really, but nobody came. because of this mental anguish, my grades began to take a nosedive. i became more unfocused in class as time went on. grades were the last thing on my mind due to being bullied. satan, however, didn't see this as a choice. he yelled at me, berated me, etc, all for something that i couldn't control. my mother did nothing about this, she constantly ignored me, which i think is even worse than berating. IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT I WAS GETTING BULLIED. but no matter what, my crystal clear cries for help fell on deaf ears, every single time. my environment just caused me to completely shut down and try and seal myself away from the world.middle school is where i got the brunt of the bullying and abuse at home. but, amid all of this bullying, is where i met my second friend. he, too, was a new student. i approached him and we became friends pretty quickly. my feelings of platonic affection for him rapidly blossomed into feelings of romantic love for him. during this time, i realized i was bisexual. but i felt wrong for liking him. i thought he could never like an ugly creature like me. me and him would always pass notes in class. i always used to draw pictures for him. even though i loved him like i never thought i could, i never confessed my feelings for him. he was my first and only crush to date. i wanted to go on so many adventures with him, i wanted him to see my feelings without me saying a word. but that never came to light, all because i was a pussy and never confessed. i always think about what we could've been if i had confessed.then, suddenly, my life took another u-turn. me and my younger siblings were taken away by child services due to my elder brother reporting the treacherous conditions that we were living in at the shoebox. my siblings and i temporarily moved to our great aunts house. during this time, we transferred to a new school. i never got to say goodbye to my friend. i liked this new school, just like the other school that i went to in second grade, it's just that i wasn't able to connect with anybody. and then, covid hit. me and my siblings eventually went back to the shoebox temporarily until we found a new place. i was overjoyed that i could finally leave that terrible place behind. but, because of covid, i couldn't return back to my old school.in 2021, i graduated middle school amidst the pandemic. i wish me and my friend had graduated together, but unfortunately that wasn't possible. this would eventually kick off the empty and most depressing days to date with me going into high school.the new place was pretty cool, though we hardly cleaned it. old habits do tend to die hard. because we hardly cleaned that shoebox hell, we didn't clean this place either. me living at this residence was short lived, and we moved to another place nearby, which is where i currently reside. this place, too, hardly gets cleaned.back to the school subject. i have not gained one friend since stepping into that dreached place. i hate going there. i hate attending there. at my age of 17 you would expect me to be part of a friend group or have a romantic partner, but i don't have any of those. i am basically a ghost around school. nobody pays attention to me, even though i try to make my presence known. i have cried in class multiple times without anybody batting an eye. during freshman year, i finally realized that i am a trans male, though i have never told anyone. i feel like it's too late now that i am a senior next month and the whole school essentially sees me as a girl. i hate it. it makes me want to kill myself, makes me want to erase myself from existence. which brings me to the main topic: why i want to die.that novella that i just wrote is one of the reasons. i hate my past, i don't think i could ever recover from it. there's a ton more stuff but that is just the tip of the iceberg, as well as stuff that i can't think of at the moment.reason #2: my siblings. specifically, my younger siblings. my siblings have destroyed everything that has and had made me happy. i used to have a fish lamp many years ago, and i recently remembered that one of my younger siblings destroyed it. i had gotten gifted a lego minecraft set for christmas one year only for my siblings to destroy that as well. my siblings have also destroyed prizes of mine. my siblings always try and push me to my limits because its ""funny"". it's actually detrimental to my health. the main culprit, however, is my youngest sister. she always finds a reason to make me yell and make me upset. she always gropes me, saying inappropriate things about me, saying my deadname out loud because ""haha funny lol XD"", moans in my ear, goes through my things, etc. i hate her. hate isn't even a strong enough word. and yes, i have told my parents, i have told my school counselor that always says to go tell my parents. there's nothing i can do about this.reason #3: nobody cares about me. like i said earlier, i am simply a blight upon the world. people go out of their way to stay away from me. nobody really shows an interest in me. i have no special attributes. when i talk to my school counselor, she looks disinterested, like im wasting her time. remember when i said that anyone i become friends with prefers someone else? well, my friend from middle school had just recently ghosted me, which makes me friendless again :Dthere goes 5 years down the drainreason #4: im just disgusting. i didn't ask to be born into a female body, especially an ugly female body. i really wish i wasn't born at all. my conception could have easily been avoided. im sick of living as something im not. i haven't come out to my parents out of fear, but at this point idc, i don't have anything to live for anyways, or any reason to live. and yeah my younger sister doesn't know im not a girl, but it still hurts all the same when she calls me that. serves as a constant remember of someone who isn't really me.there is a lot more that can go in this post, but im not gonna write a book about my whole life. i hope someone hits me with their truck tomorrow. and thank you, for whoever cared enough to read through this whole thing, about my stupid worthless life.",0

"Today I was listening to old indie songs I loved in high school and it brought me back to you. I somehow transcended to fall of 2017 - I drew you killing floor 2 zeds - one of the many games we were obsessed with at that time. Many things are still tainted by you. Orange Halloween lights, pumpkin scented candles, Riftten, Kharjo, the smell of wet grass early in the mornings. When skipping class in college I can’t help but to remember us skipping school to play bloodborne. A game we once easily played over a dozen times is now the most difficult thing in the world. As i enter the hunters dream, suddenly back in time. It’s all so vivid. I’ve always had detailed imagination, but it’s been getting more intense recently. Maybe it’s due to my depression getting worse, maybe it’s because you haven’t spoke to me in two years, or maybe it’s because im finally accepting the fact that you are never coming back and my worst fear came to life - you in love with your new girlfriend, your forever and I was nothing more than an ex you wish never happened. In these rare moments I drift back to you, i drift back to 2017, 2018, and the last few months of 2019. It all feels so real and I wish I could just stay there forever. I know it’s not real but my god it feels like everything never happened.. like reality was all just a nightmare. “stay with me forever” is what you always say to me when this happens.

I know it’s a dumb reason to be truly depressed about or even suicidal but I can’t control it.

"Today was a more taxing day than usual. Disruption at home compounded woth some realizations from self-help audio books. 1) I was listening to ""Avoidant"" while driving around today. The book has me identified to a T, like, scary-ass today's horiscope has your full name and address level accuracy. Listening to what it is to be an avoidant-dismissive person and how one becomes this way had me relive alot of the crap I went through in my life, ticking the boxes as they were described. Then, how I damage those around me. . . Once again ticking all the boxes. All the while, not feeling all that much save for being drained. As if an hour of listening to this was the equivilant to working 4 hours out in the heat. It just struck me as one of the strangest experiences I have had in awhile.2) Increasing fights at home with my wife. She sAyS she wants my oppinions, thoughts, and feelings.... but just like my father and step mother, they are always wrong. I hate the trap. ""What are you feeling?"" Proceed to painfully tear down walls to see what may or may not be emotions... then when I share them, ""WTF, thats stupid. You can't feel like that. Thats wrong. You are wrong."" At this point, I can't tell if I am being kicked because I AM wrong or if the alexthymia has me rattling off something truely stupid. Like someone learing a foreign language for two weeks before thier vacation.... just to sound like a complete fool to the natives. Then the surprised pikachu or feeling offended when I later turn down discussing anything. I know as a human I am 'supposed' to have emotions, they are not supposed to be easy... but I find I just emulate them now and that angers people more than just being a cold machine. I don't know if I want to be 'fixed' or 'accepted' anymore, but either way, it sapps my energy as well.3) My flirty infatuation with The Reaper has been intensifying over the past year. Going from a bad evening here and there of, ""I'm better off gone"" to 7-10 days straight where my idle (and sometimes intrusively) I would rather be making my exit stage left. There is alot of planning and alot of almost finding peace in knowing I have an exit strategy. It doesn't bother me, but I know it is supposed to be wrong. Like the points above, this is also sapping my energy. So now I am this hisl just fumbling through things. Getting berrated around every corner by everyone, while also getting, ""why do you look so spent? Tired? Sick?"" I dunno, you try driving a car woth holes in the gas tank and see how far you get in the day to day. Anyrate, there is today's rambling as I try and defrag my thoughts on all this. Guess it helpped me kinda breakdown and organize my scattered thoughts somewhat.",0
"Currently right now im not happy with life...im 25 years old women and I simply do not like to work. i graduated with a degree in speech therapy but im not interested enough to go through and pursue the masters. i currently work as a teacher assistant and i like/hate it. My dad keep saying I should get a higher paying job as a case manager or work for the city (I live in NYC) but that doesn't sound very interesting to me. I just hate bussing my ass every morning to go to work, that I dont want to go to.I want a more exciting life. Ive always been interested in the arts and creative paths such as content creator, model, artist (painter), actress, beauty (hair/nails), tattoo artist, entrepenuer.Plus I want to be tatted up in life idk how thats going to be perceived by others or employers. I simply just want to be free and do me. No work a basic 9-5 in a facility somewhere....",0
"I have an amazing, attentive spouse, 2 wonderful children, dogs, house, career I love, going back to school, great familial support system… I am so very fortunate and privileged. Yet I don’t want to be here anymore. The guilt of not wanting to live my life is just compounding on the problem feelings I already have. Talk therapy doesn’t work and I hate being a zombie on meds. What am I supposed to do at this point? Nothing works and I’m so tired. ",0
"For context, I am dating a Chinese guy and I absolutely adore him. We have been dating for about a year and I feel that he doesn’t think I’m pretty. He never told me this, but i always feel that as a black girl, it makes me inferior to other asian women’s beauty. Because of this, I can’t see why he likes me. I have been so depressed about this and it affects my confidence greatly. I see asian couples and i always think they’re so gorgeous together and then I think we look wrong or I would think he actually wants a relationship with an asian woman instead. He says be really loves me but I cant let myself believe it. Is there a way I can correct this feeling of worthlessness?",0
"I don't really know what to put for this title.I think I get attached to people very easily. I don't know. I don't know how to word this. I've texted the suicide hotline, and I grew attached to the people that texted me, I had a lot of things to say, but they didn't do much. All they did was repeat what I said back at me. They said they cared, but I know they didn't. But then I cried when our conversation ended. I wanted to talk to them more. I wanted to be someone important in their life. I hate it! I've grown attached to other people I don't know, but I don't want to tell anyone, because everything I've said so far is embarrassing enough. Also I am 14. I want a therapist, but I'm scared I'm going to grow too attached to them. I'm going to leave them eventually, too. They're going to forget me. I also have grown to hate therapists, I don't know why. Maybe it's because they charge a lot, and then complain when clients complain about it. Therapists pretend to care, that's literally one of the biggest parts of their job, but...I don't know. I hate them, but I also admire them. I don't think I want a therapist or someone else who only helps me because it's their job and they get paid, I just want someone. I don't know! I noticed a few things, I only get ""attached,"" to people who I don't know much about, work with emotional stuff, I only get attached to women, maybe it's because I don't think a man can get as emotional? Is that sexist? I feel more ok being vulnerable emotionally with a woman more than a man. I don't know, I think I'm just ungrateful. I think I want a mother figure, but I already have a mother. I don't talk with he much, and she annoys me a lot. I hate myself, I'm just an awkward, ungrateful, wierd little brat. I remember making a post on another subreddit saying that I wanted to die and why. I don't want to die now (at least not nearly as much as when I made that post) and I also have grown stronger in my beliefs. I want to do big things, but how can I do that when I'm like this? How can I do that when I'm like a stupid little child that wants to be hugged and held and do the same to the other? I'm so immature, good lord.I might delete this later, because this is embarrassing. I don't know if this was a rant or something, but this has made me wonder what's wrong with me. If you've read this, I hope you have a lovely year, though it looks like this year is turning to shit. ",0
"Im currently having a mental breakdown after reading a crash report which resulted in a total loss and the opposing part car overturned. I am at fault. In the report it self it is completely false from everything that had happened prior to the accident itself. It stated ""i was in the left lane, didnt want to wait in traffic, switched lanes then rearended my car ending up on a hill"" I NEVER SAID THAT because i have complete memory of the events prior to that. This is a 5 lane highway. I was in the 2nd right lane from the shoulder the entire time in this accident. Prior i wanted to switch back into the middle lane (3rd lane) but I saw that traffic was moving too fast so i stayed put. I saw the right lane was empty and wanted to go there to slow down just in case if anything happened but saw the lane was fully stopped so i stayed put. There was a box truck stopped in the 1st lane with no traffic infront of him. Ok odd i thought to myself. Then a moment later the cars in the right laned swerved to the left while stopped into the 2nd lane (my lane) which resulted in the driver in front of me slamming on there brakes so i do as well. I was already giving distance and space and knew i had enough time and space to stop if needed. In a span of a second or so the car in front of me was fully stopped. AND I KNEW THE LANE TO THE RIGHT OF ME WAS CLEAR SO IN A LAST DITCH MOMENT I TRIED TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT. It wasnt enough next thing you know i hit something and im up on a hill. I was fully aware of my surroundings and Was paying full attention to what was in front of me. My story never changed from the start of to the end. I never lied or fabricated the story. Prior to being in the 2nd lane i was in the 4th lane a whiles back. But i saw they were slowing so i switched into the 3rd lane waiting for a moment then switched into the 2nd lane. I was in the 2nd lane for a good amount of time bc I had my brakes and was slowed down significantly prior to being in the 2nd lane. And saw that i was also slowing down so I gave space and saw the box truck stopped to the right in front of me. While i was in the 2nd lane i wanted to switch to the 3rd lane but couldnt becaude the speeds were too fast and i was already slowed down. The thing is whenever im in the left lane and see traffic slowing down I ALWAYS SWITCH TO THE RIGHT LANES because i dont trust people in general. I always wait before switching multiple lanes staying in the lane before switching again. How am i supposed to live with this and fight the 2 tickets unsafe lane change and carelessly driving. The report said they had statements from an off duty officer as a witness. I WAS NEVER IN THE LEFT LANE PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT... And now people are calling me a liar and that theres footage of what i Said. Ik what i said and it wasnt that i never said i was in the left lane and didnt want to wait for traffic. And i never did any unsafe lane change to begin with. The car in front of me was a white jeep cherokee which was the vehicle that overturned. The damage to my car shows that as well. It says that i rear ended but it was the right end of the car which made it flip. If i rear ended then why is the car flipped. I was driving an escalade. Idfk what to do. I judt want to give ypm i am lost. Idk what to do. I want it to end. And better yet my mental state after the accident has been shit. Even when questioned by the officer i was in distress. But i know i didnt say what the report said. I have my therapist to back me up. I NEVER FUCKING LIED OR SAID THAT EVER. Idk what to do i have a lawyer thats helping me with the ticket but with the crash report idk what to do. I dont fucking know what to do. Ik i have shit memory to begin with but when it comes to traumatizing and stressfull evens like this I have perfect memory of what happened. How are they gonna say that I lied and disnt tell the truth. HOW. My lawyer is my uncle. I dont have money to hire a new lawyer. I dont fucking know what to do. I wanna just end this already. Idkkkkk",0

"I recently had a conversation with my gf when we were both drunk.  She told me that she feels her life would have been so much better had she stayed with an ex that cheated on her with 2 to 4 other people.  She's said similar before, but this was the first time I actually thought about how she clearly doesn't care about me.  The same day, I Googled some symptoms I've been having and could rule out 6 of 8.  One of the possibilities is that I have cancer.  I have pets who probably have about 4-6 years left and I'm thinking I should just let it happen.  I don't know if this is a normal reaction of if I should be seeking further help.  I'm just lost at this point.",0
"It is true that hugging multiple times a day has alleviated my depression. I think I’ve always hated the idea of considering myself as needing physical touch to be safe. I almost wanted physical touch not to be my love language, and even if it’s not yours— I feel like it signicantly affects your mood how much you’re hugged throughout the day. It has helped me a lot.

Next year is my senior year of high school my parents are making me take 4 AP classes. This year I only took one which I could hardly manage so i don’t know what im going to do. On top of that my parents want me to get at least a 1400 on the SAT and i might be able to but it’s just an extra thing that i have to worry about. I’ve never been motivated to study for some reason and depression is going to make it so much worse. Plus I never knew how to make friends and I basically have none so it’s not like I’ll be able to ask my friends for help or something. And I have to apply for college and I have no idea where I want to go or what I want to do anymore. I used to have interests but nothing makes me excited or happy anymore so i just play video games. I literally see no way out except suicide or going to therapy. I already talked about therapy and some of my issues to my mom said she’ll find a therapist but nothing ever happened and I really don’t want to bring it up anymore because I just feel like im burdening them with my “problems” while they’re stressed about their work.I hate posting stuff like this because I know a lot of people on this sub are going through much worse and I don’t even have it that bad and im still young but I need advice or something please,0
"Damn it. I've been on a pretty good streak for a long time, I hate to feel like I'm sliding downhill again. For a bit of context...almost two years ago I was fired from the worst job I've ever had, that dragged on for 11 agonizing years. It was a blessing in disguise and it led to me finding the job I have now, which I love. The hours are great, my co-workers are awesome, and I finally have weekends off to spend with my wife. I've been riding a high from that ever since I was hired. I feel so grateful for finally finding 'my place' that it feels wrong to be depressed, but here I am.The condensed version is: My wife and I are still living in our 'starter' home. We started out in her apartment, then moved into a duplex, and then after a really rough 4 year search, found our first house. It wasn't without it's hiccups: Of course we had a really limited budget, and then the only type of loan we qualified for that didn't require a down payment stipulated that we couldn't live within a pretty huge area. That being the case, a lot of the basic amenities we hoped for were cut off at the knees, and it seemed like we were always $10K short of being able to buy what we really wanted. We ended up in a pretty small 900 sq ft home in my home town (which I had really hoped to leave behind) in 2009.I can't complain, it's been a great little home, and I'm extremely thankful we have it. At the same time, we had hoped to live in it for 5-10 years and then find our 'forever' home. My mother moved us around a lot when I was a kid. I was constantly being ripped free and transplanted somewhere else. As I became an adult I vowed I wouldn't live my life that way. I wanted to move as few times as possible! So when I say forever home, I literally mean the one I want to be living in when I die. Within the last year or so, we've begun talking about moving, and have looked at a few places. As I'm sure most are aware, the housing market is absolutely nuts right now, and has been for a while. We're in the middle of a severe shortage of affordable housing. When we found out how much we were approved for, we were excited, and thought that all the hard work was finally going to pay off. Then we started looking and found out that, just like our first home buying experience, we're just short of being able to buy something decent. The part that really kills me is, we're not looking to live in a mansion. We're extremely moderate, we'd just like something a little bigger, like 1,100-1,300 square feet. Just enough so we aren't tripping over each other. I really hate to sound entitled, but after kicking, punching, and clawing for everything we've ever had, it'd be nice to have ONE thing go our way.Again, I feel terrible for complaining, since there are a lot of folks that don't have homes, or are struggling to buy their first house. I guess I just thought that by mid life, we might be able to see some of the fruits of our labor. Instead I feel like there's no point in continuing to look. I feel like we're going to be stuck in our cramped little house forever. Thanks for listening. ",0
"It's been months of this and while I'm doing much better now than before as now it happens once every other week it still sucks. Around February- mid April it was multiple times throughout a week where I'd feel like this. Just incredible loneliness and feeling betrayed by those I trusted and having to let go of the woman whom I still have feelings for. The love is Definitely going away but I'm afraid the love will be replaced with hatred. So many times I think of her now and I just remember how she used me to buy her a uniform which was almost $1,000. How she'd say some incredibly selfish and hurtful things to me whenever she was mad because she knew I never raised my voice to her or said things to hurt her. How she'd love bomb me in moments where I would potentially not be in her life anymore to entrap me. The nonstop gaslighting she did whenever I'd tell her how she did or said something wrong and not just when it was towards me but others as well. The inconsistency of her feelings towards me of 1 day saying she loves me and then the next saying she didn't. I could go on and on of all the toxicity of that relationship but in the end it was other people that broke the cables back. It was false stories told by others that made me realize I had to cut her off from my life yet even that hurts because I hate the way I did it. I just told her to go back to thinking I'm dead(it's a long story that someone else caused and I had to fix when I found out it happened) and that was the last thing I said to her in December. Once I'd remember the great times we had like when I took her to watch the 2nd miles morales movie and she wouldn't stop gushing over it for a week. All the laughs we shared like when I called someone whom we both knew a ""potato"" because of how incompetent he is and she loved that joke. Or when she'd feel incredibly sad and just needed me to be there for her so she'd cry on my shoulder or chest. How she lost both her jobs and I got her a new one so she wouldn't have such a sheltered life. The times I'd hear her tell me she hadn't eaten all day not because she's not hungry but because she felt so low she couldn't bring herself to move so I dropped what I was doing and drove to her favorite food stop(taco bell or popeyes) got her her favorite order which I memorized and brought it to her while she was at work. All those moments we shared and just like before I can go on and on of how amazing they were. Yet all I feel now is regret and sadness. I miss you B but for the sake of my own mental health I need help that you can't give by being in my life again. I have to keep you blocked on everything and stay no contact. No matter how much it fucking hurts.",0
"Why cant i at least just fake it and make it seem like im happy. I hate talking about my emotions let alone acknowledging them. But its impossible to hide from them. Even if i try to suppress my emotions and ignore the depressing thoughts, it still finds a way to show on the surface. I hate it. I cant even wake up without feeling somewhat like crying because i just wanna go back to sleep and stay asleep. There’s so many things i want to do but it all seems like its not possible for me to even try. Why do i have to be here. Everyone says everything happens for a reason, everyone has a purpose in life. Whats my purpose. Coz it seems to me im only here to suffer alone with things that arent even that bad compared to others. And i know i shouldnt compare but its really hard not to. I feel like i shouldnt be complaining or even depressed at all but I am and now im so used to having depression im too scared to not be depressed and anxious and paranoid about everything.",0
"everything has changed so drastically in my life recently. I lost my job, my house, my long term relationship and my will to live. I’m too much of a coward to do anything painful and anything painless seems too difficult. I miss them so much, we were just about to get engaged and then I lost my job and they left. I’m stuck in this stupid limbo of deep depression every day. Nothing brings me happiness. I don’t speak to many people. I wish I had a Time Machine or a hitman. Things are too hard and I really wish I had an easy way out. help me end this suffering. ",0
"I (F22) graduated a semester early from a university in America. This wasn’t an Ivy League university or the league under it, but it was still a private school with a good reputation. I graduated magna cum laude as a strategic communications major. You can probably guess by the name of the major that it is a liberal arts degree and my brother (M28) has told me this is a stupid and easy degree, and has emphasized it is easy to get a good GPA in this major. I don’t feel I’ve worked hard enough because of that sentiment; I don’t know how to even respond to that because I loved what I learned and I loved going to this school, even if it was expensive. It has always been my dream to go to law school and I applied to schools just as I was graduating. I got a 164 on my LSATs, had my 3.8 gpa, a good personal statement, internships on my resume and other things I felt were note worthy.I got a full ride from 8 schools and got waitlisted from Georgetown law (ranked 14 or at least it was when I applied)    Despite all this, I can’t help but feeling like a failure. My brother who is in finance tells me being a lawyer is stupid but this was my dream for so long. Even though I have a full ride for school, I feel stupid going in to debt to pay for my housing during this schooling. Am I even worth it. Am I smart enough to go to law school. My brother also told me the school I chose was a stupid choice. I chose the school because it was small and I liked the community it seemed to offer. However, the school is ranked around 60 nationally. I got into other higher ranked schools but I couldn’t help but choose this one because it was the best financial offer they gave me. I still feel like a moron, and this barely coherent post isn’t making me feel any better. I feel like I should just quit while I’m ahead and not go to school bc I’m not good enough and cut my losses. I wish I was Ivy League level but I’m not. I wish I was better looking. I wish I was thinner. I just wish I was better in every way. Everyone keeps telling me I should ignore my brother and that I should be proud of myself but I can’t help but feel like a failure. No matter what I do, no matter how far I might go in life, I think I’ll always feel like I’m inferior in one way or another. ",0
"The first thing I will say is that this was never supposed to be a surprise. But it was never “if” this would happen, it was always “when”.I know the pain that I am going to cause, and trust me it’s the last thing I’ll ever think about - the pain I inflicted throughout my life and the pain I will cause by doing this. I can’t even tell you that I tried, because you all know, deep down, that I didn’t. I’ve never tried hard in my entire life. Not even for the people I love the most. Coming to terms with the fact that even though I’m going to cause absolute devastation and hurt to people that I adore, it isn’t enough to stay.Maybe that’s what I’m most sorry for. That despite how much I love you all, it wasn’t enough, to push me to try - to live. You didn’t do anything wrong. You tried so fucking hard and were met with tears and excuses.Molly, you’ve been a second mum since we were kids. You constantly had to remind me to show up and do things that should’ve come naturally to me. I mean, who has to be reminded to buy their own mum a birthday card? I could apologise to you, but you’d never accept it fully, not now I’m doing this. If I told you I was at this point, you’d panic and once again try to fix things, and take responsibility for my actions. This isn’t on you. Nothing should’ve ever relied on you alone. Yet it always was. You were never supposed to bear such a responsibility - to act for both of us. Yet again, it always was. And I was never thankful. But trust me; I am now.Mum, there’s nothing you could’ve said n c or done to prevent this. No matter how intense your love and care is, this was always on the cards. I never hugged you enough, or tell you how much comfort I felt sitting in the kitchen with you and Molly, just us and the dogs laughing. It was almost quiet in my head. But like i said - since I was a kid I knew this was how it’d go. And that’s not down to you or dad or how I was raised. And never think that for a second.Dad, you know me almost too well, and weren’t afraid to tell me how my behaviours affected your life, and that’s the only thing I feel grateful for now. You didn’t push me over the edge, nor did your words change my outcome. The opposite is true - you have been the sole reason I’ve lived each day for 7 months and 6 days. Everyone in our family will find the irony in my death being the only thing I’ve planned in my life. This was always going to be it for me, and I’m truly sorry that I caused so much hardship. You have Covid right now as I’m typing this, and still have to take up the slack with housework and shit. What does that say about me and the person I am? I’m so faulty that killing myself seems like an easier option than change and it’s been like that since I can remember and that’s fucking embarrassing. But I think deep down you knew that. And yet you still tried, which says a lot about the good in you. I’m sorry to those who I didn’t mention - if I felt I had the time, I would write essays to all of you. But in my heart, the timer’s going off. I could write for hours to all of you, to every member of my family and the feelings I have towards you. But there’s no point. I could rattle on about how sorry I am, and how much pain I’m in. I could go on and on about how broken I am and that I’ve tried my hardest to live a good life for you all but that’s a lie. Nothing will ever be enough for me. I guess I’m too lazy to even want to live. And I’m too stubborn to admit, that I wanted to die in these last few months. Maybe that’s why I’ve subtly ruined my relationships with everyone, subconsciously trying to make it easier for everyone to deal with. But it’s not going to help. Nothing I say right now, is going to help. Fuck I don’t even care that if after all of this is over, that I’m “at peace” - I don’t even care about that. You should’ve all been enough for me, for anyone else, the vast amount of love I received from my family could’ve carried someone through a thousand lifetimes, except mine. I am sorry, and I do love you all so much. But I wasn’t supposed to be here for this long, maybe not even at all. You all deserved a better daughter, a better sister, a better granddaughter, and a better niece. I’m sorry that I couldn’t live for you. It’ll be okay somehow, someday, maybe. You were all the last thing on my mind, and your love resonates through me. But this is how it was always meant to go - I finally have the esteem to act. I love you.From Ellie x",0

"Im 34 year old. Depression has always been present in my life. This year however I met someone who made it all go away for the first time in over a decade. As time went on they pulled away more and more. While i still tried to hold on.  They treated me like trash while i tried everything to make them happy. All i ever did was care and want to be around them because life made so much sense again. I havent made a real friend in so long that it was amazing to have again. I brought this person into my circle of friends and now they are around to stay. Always present. I feel like im not allowed to come around anymore because i dont want any drama to unfold. All this to say..its killed me inside. I have no hope or anyone to talk too. I feel like everyday is just one bad moment from being my last day. I have no interest in anything. All i do is sleep. Today I slept 16 hours. Im tired of going to friends and family because i feel as though im crying wolf. They tell me advice i listen but it never gets better. I have done therapy, have medications. Done work shops and see medical professionals.  Nothing makes the pain go away.  Why is it so hard to find a genuine friend. ? Or someone who loves you. What im getting at is..Is there even a point to this daily anguish anymore? What do i have to gain from fighting the thoughts of suicide except one more day of pain.  To repeat the cycle again and again. What's the point in anything if it can't be shared with others.  How do you keep going everyday when you feel so alone.?

"I’m 15 and I can’t even physically explain how much I want something or someone to kill me so I don’t have to do it myself. When I’m around people I’m awkward, weird, ppl think I’m jus a person who floats around in the background and doesn’t care abt anything. I hate it, if I told any of my friends my issues they would probably never speak to me again. Everytime I’m around ppl I jus want to bawl my eyes out. Then why I’m by myself I want to bawl my eyes out. I said this to one of the girls I was closer wit a few months back when I was 14 and she was like “no way u don’t care abt anything” and jus started talking abt herself.Next up what I hate is the fact I even started doing drugs. Nic, then weed, then I wish I never touched bars or pain-ks. I’ve been clean for a week and if I tell anybody they think I’m either a pussy A, or B that I’m seeking for attention. Next is the fact I was sexually assaulted and everyone LOVES the dude who did it. Whenever he comes up ppl say how funny he is. I didn’t find it very funny when he strangled me and forced me to do it when he was 17, his friend was 19 and I was freshly 14.The other thing that was been driving me aboslutely crazy is I had a dream my father died in a car crash, three months later, that’s the dream I have, every.single. Night. It’s driving me insane. Absolutely off the fucking wall. The final and last thing, is finding out why my “mother” always outed me. Because I’m my aunts, who was a drug addict that oded so my dad is my uncle and I don’t know who the fuck the actual father is. Whelp. Why can’t someone jus end me now. Like I’m begging. No way it gets better if it’s this bad at FIFTEEN ",0
"I have always had that same helpless depressed feeling since i was like 9-8 years old. It wasn't as bad back then but now its worse than ever. I wanna commit suicide but it would just make things worse for my family. i wanna talk to my friend about it but she's already depressed and dealing with her own mental health and i don't wanna burden her with my problems. I have no other friends, i don't go out, all i do is stay inside on the internet. I have almost zero motivation to keep going. Suicide is the only thing i can turn to.",0
It’s been years 6 I think I had some online friends but one was manipulative he pretended to commit suicide to get what he wantedI spent my time slowly getting back at him it ended with him having no friends kicked out of school a complete and utter loser most of his family dosent even talk to him anymore I know what I did was awful and I deserve what’s happening to me I probably deserve much worse but I thought it would fade over time I’d forget it’s been 2 years since we last spoke and there is not a second in the day I don’t wanna hurt myself to make up for the things I’ve done I can’t hold any kind of relationship with friends or lovers because I’m in fear that I’m gonna ruin them I’m going to break them and there better off without me I think I’m strong willed but I just can’t do this anymore I’ve been considering seriously hurting myself more and more over the past night please anyone I need something to just make me forget ,0
"Depression has a funny way of messing with your mind. I can’t really tell if it creates easy lies or hard truths. The moment you start behaving differently, it’s like everyone ceases to be around you. I know “negative energy” can be a pain I the ass but it makes me think. If I was gone, would I even be missed? Put a dent in someone’s heart or am I just that expendable? I understand life goes on but a little bit of a pause would be nice. Memorable. People move on to different pathways and that’s amazing. But when everything is ripped apart outside of your control, you’re left with just… pain. It fucking hurts and you’ll have it for life. Having depression feels like a bone that never heals properly and what really fucking sucks is depressive episodes can occur out of nowhere! It sinks you right back and then you wonder how freaking long will it take to get out of it this time or am I even going to make it out at all? My depression is always there I know but sometimes I can mask it well and other times I can’t.  I don’t know if anyone else here gets it but… it’s a constant battle of paranoia that everyone that has come in and back out of your life always hated you or are you consistently   being tricked by your own mind and it’s just you  that’s the problem? I don’t think I’m different. I know I am.  It’s like you can just sense the person across from you would have absolutely no IDEA what goes on in your head. I see who’s around me and know what I look like, what I sound like, how I interpret the world. No matter how much I’ve tried to change myself, I’ll always stuck out like a sore thumb and I fucking hate it!!!  It’s not fair! People I am spiraling here and I need a saving fucking grace right now. ",0

"Ever since I was young, most people at some point tend to hate me. It wasn't as bad when I was a kid, definitely not. Probably started noticing it around middle school. Now I'm 21 and it seems like quite literally a good majority of people I meet end up hating, bullying, or being annoyed by me at some point to the point where it affects my daily life and sometimes my health. Especially now, its so bad...  People on the internet especially but also co workers, I have had four co workers in counting now at my job hate my guts to the point they try to get me fired, boss me around, one even got up in my face and started a screaming match in the yard.. one kept telling me lies about the boss, now one is bossing me around and acting like I don't work when I do everything she asks of me (despite her not being my superior..) most people I've made friends with I fell off with terribly, I have a small group of close friends (4 to be exact) but otherwise most people I've been friendly with I fell off with terribly.  The internet is definitely the worst though..it's seriously like I am being targeted, for example I will leave a comment adding onto another post I agree with, and people who don't agree will immediately start arguing with me instead of the OP. People attack, berade, and threaten me very often. Even when I say nothing offensive, just sharing my opinion and people will make personal threats, bully me for my looks or just straight up telling me to STFU... I try to be nice, I am autistic so I have very poor social skills but I do everything I can to be nice and cooperative (sometimes too much so to where I am used by people) I don't judge people, definitely a people pleaser and I'd do just about anything someone I respect asked of me directly. I do like to give advice when I think it could be helpful which a lot of people seem to take offense to and I have noticed a lot of folks get especially Ped off about.. I hate saying no, I am pretty flaky and terrible at communication but it's due to extreme anxiety I can't really control 😕 I tend to mirror people as I have a very poor sense of self, so I always treat others the exact same way they treat me. I just don't understand what's so unlikeable? Like people love to hate me almost.. I know I'm a little weird and emotional, but I know people who are the same exact way and still treat me like trash.

"I was an addict and got clean and have been on methadone and anxiety meds for 8 years. I put on 150lbs because I just ate all day. Around Covid I decided to really change my life so I lost over a hundred pounds and started tapering all my meds. I got off the depression meds and tapered slowly halfway off of the methadone and clonazepam. No withdrawal or anything because i was doing it really slow microtaper. Also I workout everyday and felt really good and started planning for a normal life when I finish I woke up one day 7months ago and started having weird anxiety out of nowhere and all kinds of body pain, I went to the hospital dozens of times and got brushed off most the time but kept asking for tests. They found h pylori and I thought that was the problem and another specialist also did tests and said I have rheumatoid arthritis. I guess he is right and it explain why I haven’t felt normal with all kinds of symptoms mental and physical. I can’t even continue my taper and had to raise my meds up because I because suicidal and couldn’t function. I don’t see any of this getting better and tried therapists psychiatrists and specialists and whatever else. I can’t even do my job because I get pain and anxiety. I have symptoms I’ve never felt before and it’s become impossible to have a normal day let alone taper my meds. Even if I taper them my body is broken because of the autoimmune disease now. I don’t see a normal life ahead of me. I thought I was healthy or at least could be but I’m not anymore and won’t ever be. I really don’t want to live anymore but too scared to kilo myself ",0

"When I was younger I was bullied for basically           my entire school life. It was so bad it traumatized me. When I got into college I thought it will be better for me and I wanted to make some more friends because in school I didn't have many friends. I was quiet and composed, introverted whereas everyone else was loud and very outspoken, I was also quite skinny so I was targeted. I often get flashbacks of all the times people bullied me and made fun of me. I tried to make friends with some people the best I could but I wasn't really able to connect with most of them because of my social anxiety and people here are also very extroverted. I was able to make friends with some people but overtime they distanced themselves from me, cut themselves off from me once they realised that I am a shy, socially awkward person. Now those very people whom I used to consider my friends at one point laugh at me and make fun of me when they feel I won't notice. People think of me as a joke hardly anyone understands me. I am so tired of being made fun of, I am so tired of people disrespecting me, I am so tired of being treated like I don't matter I can't take it anymore. I only really have a handful of friends left but none of them are that close. As a result I suffer from loneliness and the anxiety that I will end up alone in the future. My self esteem has been absolutely destroyed because of this I don't really feel happy at all, how do I fix this? Most days I hate myself how do I make myself feel better? ",0
I’m going through a depressive episode and I feel guilty that I have minimal feelings towards anyone or anything right now. My fiancé is very loving and supportive but it feels like I can’t connect. I feel (or don’t feel) the same way towards our puppy right now. Logically I know I care for them but can’t feel love towards either of them. Is this “normal” for depression or am I just falling out of love with my fiancé and caring less about those around me? I don’t want to feel this way I want to return to feeling love towards them. ,0
"I’ve had depression most of my life (I’m now 26) but since being pregnant (23w) it’s intensified. I’m crying almost daily. My partner is sick of it because I’m irritable (We have recently moved in our new home out of his mums place) but it’s only over small things (e.g not letting his dog out to do his business, or being happy around others but hardly wanting to talk to me) I feel like there must be something wrong with me as he’s avoiding me even on weekends spending long hours golfing, when we spend time with people he’s happy go lucky then soon as he’s alone with me he goes quiet I get upset as I think I’ve done something wrong. His mum barely makes conversation with me and it’s always been that way even when I was living with her for 2 years!! My fiancés brothers girlfriend also lived with us and his mum and her could chat for hours!  Everyone loves her too and yet no one makes that effort with me? (She is a lovely girl, I just can’t help but feel jealous. They all say “love you!” &amp; “miss you!” If she’s off out somewhere, but never to me. I just get a blunt “bye” I’ve been nothing but polite and when living there I used to do a lot of the housework, the other gf didn’t do anything. Just makes me wonder what she has that I don’t…)I barely have any friends to talk to so the only person I speak to is my mum, and she lately has had to listen to me cry on the phone asking “what is wrong with me for everyone to want next to nothing to do with me?” I’m getting married in April so my mind is also guilting me about baby weight, it’s telling me no one likes me and now not even my husband to be likes meI feel my unborn baby girl will just grow up to hate me too. I just don’t understand what it is about me that makes people repel from me? Am I that miserable to be around even when I’m trying to hide it? I have social anxiety as well so small things like going to the shops can be quite daunting but I did manage to do that today, but I can’t even be proud of myself. I feel like I’ve lost who I was. I’m no longer laughing or cracking jokes like I was pre pregnancy. I don’t feel beautiful in this pregnant body. ",0

"One of the memories that have stuck with me all my life was my dad cornering himself after criticizing an event for kids with cerebral palsy and saying ""That's what you get when you have kids later in life"", which prompted me to tell him that at least those parents could not only afford healthcare and wellbeing for their kids (disabled or not) but they also took the time to know themselves and prepare as much as possible to be parents and then after realizing his mistake decided to end the conversation with ""I just wanted to have kids""That was around 20 years ago. I was a teenager with a set mind of a childfree life (given the amount of poverty that surrounded me) and with a lot of signs pointing at my latent homosexuality. Now during all this time, lots have happened. Still running the longest depressive state of my life, realizing I'm autistic, contemplating that sexuality is a spectrum and one can like more than one expression at a time. AND STILL I'm stuck in that fucking moment... Imagine knowing that your child is autistic and doing nothing to prepare him for the world he's about to face. Failing your child because your ignorance and homophobia go better with the society you live in. And finally, having kids just ""because you want to""And I'm here, defeated, desperate, wanting to leave but unable to (won't hurt myself unless I know it's for real).  I've been learning a lot about myself but seriously asking myself if it's worth trying anything here? I'm gonna die one way or another. I've become a social pariah no one wants to talk to or help or (my favorite) unwilling to sell anything to. So why improve or care? why even try? Why won't they just let me go in peace? Fuck, I wanna go out of here so badly",0

"Hi guys,Since I‘ve been very young (roughly 10 years old) I have struggled with the thought that there is no meaning in life, classical nihilism. The realisation of this „fact“ led to a what I think is a suicidal episode which did not lead to a suicide, luckily. Since then this thought never left me, but it didn’t led to suicidal thoughts too often. I’ve read a few philosophical ideas about the meaning of life and nihilism, for example Nietzsches life-affirming nihilism. Sadly I am not able to adopt this way of thinking, the „fact“ that there is no (general) meaning irritates me most of the time.  Now here is my question: Why am I even bothered by this thought? I don’t think it is rational, neither itself - if we think about the human as a mammal who instinctively wants to survive - but not in the consequences too. Even if the premise is right I think it shouldn’t result in a wish to die, because when life has no meaning death doesn’t have it too, am I right? Which leads to the question, is this just a philosophical nihilism that I can’t refute or could it be that it is more like a rationalization of the nonexistence of a will to live? I would appreciate if any of you cold give me an answer to that.Annotation 1: I don’t know if this is in the right subreddit, if it’s not please tell me and I will delete this post.Annotation 2: I am not diagnosed with depression, I am currently in the process of getting into therapy to get a diagnosis and hopefully an improvement.Annotation 3: If this post should be written in bad or weird language I want to apologise preventive. English is not my first language / I am not a native speaker. Thank you in advance. ",0
"Idk why I’m posting this here. Probably because I don’t want to worry my family but I need this out somewhere. I’m so fucking depressed, I got off my meds a few months ago because they were giving me really horrible heart burn. I thought I would be okay to just experience life. I’m not. I spend my whole awake time actively convincing my brain that life isn’t so bad. I don’t feel like meds are the answer because they never do anything more than numb me completely. I work a job I hate, pay is shit, cost of living is increasing. I can’t afford to do anything besides work and go home. I’m a mother, I love my children, and they are the sole reason I’m still alive. Idk I’m just tired and scared of myself. An inpatient stay is not an option for me so I have to just keep pushing. But after almost 20 years of constant mental battle I’m exhausted. I don’t even have the energy to try and get better anymore. ",0
"To keep things brief, it’s been a hell of a year, after several difficult years. 2021 - was unemployed, got long covid, getting into debt. Diagnosed with depression and meds. 2022 - started a new job and working with therapy on the long covid and anxiety. 2023 - Start of year started feeling well enough to try coming off meds, stopped Fluoxetine in April. Then the job started going wrong, my boss went AWOL, I took over. Debt reached bad levels. 2024 - moved in with my partner, house needs so much work. (On the upside, the house sale eradicated the debt). Sold house. Big birthday. Then work has went absolutely insane, 12 hour days, and it just feels like one massive thing after another now both in work and at home. I’m really struggling with anything that isn’t sitting down watching trash and falling asleep. I’m getting so angry so quickly over little things, like I’ve stopped being able to cope with any little thing. This triggers the anxiety that although things are good on paper, I’m not enjoying life. I achieved a lot, but feel nothing. For the life of me I can’t think - is this a relapse of depression (or maybe I never was really over it when I came off the meds 18 months ago?) Or is it burnout - instead of considering meds, try to get some time off work to rest and start trying to deal with things closer to home? I know there’s not lots of detail, but what do you guys think? All perspectives welcome. ",0
"I am new to Reddit, didn't really know who, where or what to get this feeling out to. But I've struggled with depression from a early age, I'm not saying this for pitty or sympathy but a little context about me, I grew up really rough mother was struggling with drug addiction father wasn't around in and out of foster homes the whole 9. So I've always had a shattered psyche. And I've never let my mental health get the better of me ask any family member or friend, I've always had a care free happy go lucky attitude about life it was my way to cope with my depression my logic being if I don't care or think about it it will pass and 8 out of 10 times it's always worked for me. Until lately, I'm 28 now have a wife and 2 beautiful kids, with the added weight of being a father and husband I just find myself disassociating away from my family. I find myself not being able to provide for them properly, I don't know if you have kids or whatever but as a man it takes that much more out of me. I do work a full time job, it doesn't pay much at all. I've tried seeking other better paying employment opportunities to no avail with work places still recovering from COVID and the job market crash, I am in poverty. In constant fear of utilities being cut off or even a eviction. Let me tell you as a father its absolutely devastating. And honestly it is doing so much damage on my mental health and my essence as a man. I am living my biggest fear, putting my kids not exactly how I grew up but damn near close to it situation, I feel defeated exhausted and empty. I haven't had any thoughts of suicide but lately I've been thinking about it, maybe my wife will find a better man to care for her and our children, give them opportunities I can only dream of. I have the weight of the world on my shoulders and my legs can no longer carry me out of this hole. Please God save my soul I'm sorry. I can't be a better man father or husband. I've already called my mother in law and apologized that I can't care for her daughter the way she deserves I am trying my best but I feel it's not good enough.",0

"Hi all,Tough times, guys. I'm 47, two kids (one with autism), beautiful and caring wife. Since the end of December, I'm unemployed. I've been battling clinical depression for more than a decade and, now I have no more fuel to keep on going. I have tried different therapies, a shitload of drugs just to keep my head above the water.For the last 18 years I've been working in game industry and it killed all my love for people and will to live. It ended me.I need to provide for my family, pay for my kid medicine, pay the bills... But I can't. Two months ago I was finally diagnosed with severe case of ADHD and ODD. It was too much for me I guess. Knowing that all my life I was battling the wrong enemy, that I could have have totally different life if I only knew... It broke me - a big, athletic guy, crying like a baby.The worst part of it is to keep the everyday mask on - laughing with my son, playing with my daughter on PC, doing dishes,  trying not to scare everyone with my 'running on fumes' attitude.If I had no family, it would be easier to meet the Great End, but I need to crawl through life for them. Friends don't get it (go for a run or smth, I dunno I hear, or 'see the doctor'). Doctors can't help me, they just cycle the drugs; my therapist said that I'm too stubborn to change. I won't go for another therapy, I have no money since I need to support my younger one with his treatment, and the therapists that my insurance covers are just shitty. Well, I guess that's all I wanted to say to you. ",0

"I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I keep a journal and whenever I find myself reminiscing on that past and how much happier I used to be, I read entries from that period and realize I wasn't as happy as I remember.Lately I've enjoyed taking long drives in rural areas. Sometimes I even turn off the music. If I see something interesting or stumble on a park, I'll get out and walk around. On the way back, I'll often start spiraling because I'm returning to real life. I've gone through therapists and tried all sorts of things. The only thing that's worked is just being outside, away from everything. I don't know if I'm just too soft or what, but whenever I start thinking about all the normal life challenges I'll have and that you never really get to relax, I start asking myself what the point even is. It baffles me how all adults constantly have challenges in life and yet they still go on. ",0

Tried to go for it again only to be told that, someone else came in the meantime.

"It was one hell of a journey. I wish you all the best.Hi everyone. I'm just your average guy. This will probably be nothing but mish-mash. I'll get sidetracked writing this down but you should get the general gist of why I'll be heading out first.Missed a few opportunities before I became an adult; and now the path to something I actually wanted to do is now closed. My ideal career did not match my creators'. I did not fight back, I did not resist. I just tried to trick myself into thinking it was what was ultimately good for me. I accepted it.I honestly am not sure. Sure, doing what you want to do as a job may cause you to lose passion. But looking at those who became very successful in the same path, who started much younger than I did, because when I was their age, I was telling myself my creators were right and I should not pursue what I want... I don't know. Maybe they're right. I could have failed, maybe definitely failed. But now I live with regret. Now that path is shut, steel doors permanently locking away that road for good.I've done nothing but rant over and over again to people I was close with. Ranting and being a negative asshole all the time, and we know that's a no-no. I've lost everyone in my life because of this. Remember, ""I'll always be here for you, in case you want to talk"" is not true. They just want to be polite. I should have respected their boundaries. I should have been less annoying. My friends began to see me as a nuisance, and now nobody talks to me anymore. My outer appearance is absolutely hideous. I can't look in the mirror anymore. I can't look people in the eye. I go outside with a face mask and a hat. I'm objectively disgusting. I hate every single part of me, and no, working out is not going to fix shit. You can't slap a fucking bow tie on a steaming hot pile of boar shit and say it doesn't smell bad anymore. I hate people. I hate everyone so much. Stop looking at me. Stop judging me. Stop telling me what I'm doing wrong. Stop feeling inferior to me, stop feeling anything about me when I didn't do anything to any of you fucking bastard cunts. I wish everyone somehow died simultaneously, maybe by a gigantic meteor striking the Earth, killing everyone. That would be great. I'd down a bottle of Jack Daniel's and watch as the rock gets closer and closer. Suppose my life is not a train wreck. Suppose everything flowed exactly how I wanted it to and now I'm living my dream. Would I be happy? Are you sure? I'm not sure. Maybe it could've gone better. But maybe. Maybe nothing changes. Maybe I still feel like shit. Fuck you all. You all try to validate yourselves; think you're better than one another, think you're cool, think you're going to be on top of everyone you know. Get the fuck out of here. Fuck you and fuck your stupid insecurities. You are the worst of the worst. Jesus Christ. Shut the fuck up.I'm so tired",0

"I’m 25M and currently living with parents in the UK - we have a good relationship and I don’t have issues in that regard. Although, I feel like I want more out of life and want to experience living on my own. I’ve been working as a freelance writer for the past 2 years, and I’m starting to find my footing on how to run my business + developed enough experience to charge higher rates.I feel like there’s a lot of distractions at home and my parent’s aren’t really too aligned with what I’m doing, so I’m considering moving to Japan for a year to completely focus on developing my freelance business further since I visited a few months ago and loved it there.Living at home obviously has its perks like being able to save money that I can invest into my business to grow + save a lot of time, but my mental health is getting worse here and I feel like I’m getting less done because moving out is constantly on my mind and my creativity feels limited living here. I’ve worked in other cities and it felt a lot easier for me to get things done and enjoy my work a little more.I suffered from severe depression and anxiety attacks a few weeks ago because being in my home for so long felt like it got to me, I recovered a bit but I feel like I'm becoming unhappy again and it will start affecting me again very soonRoughly, I could survive on £1000 -£1500 if I lived relatively frugal in Japan, and I spend around £300-£500 per month on living expenses living at home with parents. Do you think I should make the move ASAP if I’m able to make £5k a month consistently from my business? Or should I stay a little longer and save up more?",0
"Hi everyone,I am an MSc psychology student at Goldsmiths, University of London \* , and I’m conducting a study on the relationship between depressive symptoms, self-blaming emotions (shame and guilt) and belief in free will/scientific determinism. The study consists of 3 questionnaires and will take (in total) about **15 to 20 minutes** to complete. Participants will be able to enter a prize draw to win a £100 Eurostar gift voucher \*\*  or a £100 Charity Voucher \*\*\* . You must be above the age of 18 to participate.The study includes 8 questions regarding symptoms of depression (e.g. changes in appetite), where you have to select how frequently you’ve felt the symptom in the last 2 weeks (not at all, several days, more than half the days, nearly everyday). The other two questionnaires in the study concern belief in free will and self-blaming emotions.The study does not ask for any personal information, and your responses will be anonymous. You can withdraw your data at any time based on an identifier you provide at the beginning of the study. Entering the prize draw is optional, and the information required for the prize draw will be processed separately.I believe this study will have implications for the development of treatment of depression and other related mood disorders, as our worldview and emotions are deeply tied to our mental well being.The following is the link to the study, if you wish to participate: [~https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_0vOiKs1Rpp46HNI~](https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0vOiKs1Rpp46HNI)Thank you for your time!\* Identity verified by moderators\*\* to use a Eurostar voucher, you must be in Belgium, France, Netherlands, UK or US.\*\*\* Donation to registered charity in England and Wales or Scotland and Northern Ireland.",0

"A lot of things just bodied me at once and it’s been absolute agony since. It’s been month of just straight existence and It’s just torture sitting here. The only joy I have is going to sleep.

I keep hearing it’s going to get better, and this isn’t permanent etc, but it’s been 8 months of just pain and I don’t even see it getting better. I’m trying to meet new people and make new friends but I’m just so miserable and don’t have any type of joy in life that it shows and it’s killing me.

"Hello everyone. I'm newly an adult and the last few months I've felt myself losing the motivation to do practically anything. I used to be able to write and draw and I used to have a spark for improving myself and what I enjoy but now I just feel ... nothing? That sounds so edgy but it's true. I feel apathetic towards my own life and the relationships I've built. I have to actively stop myself from self-sabotaging my relationship with my partner out of a lack of motivation to continue. I still love them, I just don't feel like I have the drive to continue everything. The only things I can make myself do are the things others hold me to. This is gross, and I know it, but I need to be prompted to shower by family just to get the motivation to take care of myself. It's like I've lost all drive to be a human being and it's tearing me up inside. It feels like every emotion I have just gets dulled a little while after feeling it - like if something devastating happens, I'm upset for a while but then I'm numb again. I think I'm repressing things to the point of having no motivation to change my life at all. I don't work. My college offers will be coming out next month but I barely even want to go to college, I'm only going because my parents want me to. I feel like a leech, and I want to stop leeching off my parents but I just don't have the motivation to do ANYTHING to change my situation. Work would make me so miserable, I desperately don't want to work, but that makes me feel like even more of a leech. I haven't told anyone in my life I've been feeling like this. I'm scared if I tell my partner they won't see me the same, and they're who I go to with everything. The worst part is I'm mostly worried about a breakup because it could cause issues in our friend circle that would make things like DND inconvenient, not because I actually want to uphold the relationship. I feel like such a bad person for it. I love them, but I don't think I can process my own emotions enough to actually feel the love anymore. I want to love them like they deserve to be loved, but I can't even love myself. I worry if I left the relationship, they'd hurt themself. I'm worried I would too. God everything is just so complicated, I'm so scared. Fear and apathy is all I feel when I think about my future. I'm tired of feeling so numb and apathetic. I want to *want* to be alive. I want to have the drive to change myself for the better. Why do I feel so useless? Is there anything I can do to help myself? I want to be a better person. I don't want to feel so numb anymore. Please help me. This is the first time I've ever written this dow. I've never said it out loud. This is terrifying. Please be kind. (I've been to school counsellors, who didn't help, and an out of school counsellor who I just couldn't connect with in any way. I can't afford private therapy. The mental health services in my country are bad if not private, so I don't believe it's an option for me. Any other help would be appreciated. Idk if it helps but I'm autistic, possibly have ADHD and I think I'm depressed. Maybe there's something else going on with me .. idk) ",0

"I am a 23-MSo..4 years ago, suddenly, one day I felt a constipated stomach.. and probably mild gas. I was not so worried, and took some herbal ayurvedic medicines.. saw no result further. I thought I might had eat something wrong, so without thinking twice, I did started doing yoga, exercise... saw no results either. Infact, I realised there's a new symptom affecting me that is ""shortness of breathe"", and ""immediate fatigue"", it wasn't very strong earlier but later on I can feel it's severe, very severe.. I can't do mild exercise, I start breathing like a dog.. I feel so weak that even I don't feel comfortable sitting and standing, terrible body aches, headaches on regular basis, very bad thought processing, overthinking, loss of emotions, permanent numbness.. I was never like this before the symptoms started occuring one by one. After trying own medicines (3 months), I visited a doctor, preferable a gastroenterologist because it started with stomach constipation, I told him my symptoms, and also I realised I am panicking, being very nervous, almost losing breathe while talking, voice cracks, the doctor pointed me out ""Why you are looked scared?"" I felt terrible embarassment, and also a bad outcome, I noticed there's something wrong, I can't talk like I could do before.. I couldn't express myself as I used to do, I was very happy person with expressive emotions before this.. Later on later on, I kept visiting the same doctor, but he gave suggestions like ""it's s normal IBS, and you can do dieting, walking, etc."" and proceeded with giving me some medicines, it was maybe to reduce gas and increase digestion, lol. It didn't work, kept trying to visit, same result.. changed doctor, told them problems, no result, kept visiting more doctrs, no good result... At this point, I was very fed up.. I thought I will be cured forever, I will regain my mental and physical ability, I could be ok again, have a good guts.. but no, it increased more and more, I realised my mind is no more under control, it got very bad... Terrible thoughts, bad sleep, insomnia, overthinking, over sleeping, weak, fear of conversation, fear of college, very strange body jerks, sudden cramps etc. I felt more depressed, my mind couldnt let me make decisions, I couldn't think, it was like just blank thoughts.. I couldn't focus on studies, I couldn't think for my future... I couldnt talk to my mom and dad normally, they point out that my voice is becoming depressing, and I also look very sad, shocked, terribly depressed. I want help! If you guys what I've been suffering from, I want to live a good life.. it's terrible to be here, I swear.. I can't even go for a job interview, i get terrible shaking and voice crack even thinking of it.. i tried once and twice and I felt embarassed, I was shaking... Some of the tests I got done by doctors:•Urine test (very normal)•Stool test (very normal, but used to see small eggs in stool at the starting age of these symptoms.. i never got to know what was that)•Ultrasound (little 0.4mm stone in kidney + hydro nephrosis + few gas shadows) •Colonscopy (mild hemmaroids, proctitis)•Blood test (very very very low vitamin B12, D, some liver infection too, doctor said.. and took so much medicines, injections for it, it might have been normal now, I think.. or maybe not, I didn't visit doctor anymore , believing I wouldn't get cured) Symptoms I currently have, and it's severe:•Restless body, restless legs, feel like I want to continuously stretch every body part, but still it doesn't make change)•mild, but continuous pain at any of the joints in body, might be wrist, thigh, chest, neck, ankle, knees.. it keeps.coming, and going like heartbeating •Very tired, depressed, lazy, unable to think much, unable to focus, very unconfident, nervous, panicking, bad mental state, poor conversation, can't maintain eye contact, I don't go to market due to this fear, I think so much to go.. it's been 4 years. •Insomnia, on very periodic phases, as soon as I try to sleep the thoughts always are like ""man, it's been 4 years.. you aren't feeling well, you feeling suíci*I, and you are 24 years old now, you have to grab a job, I can't do anything, I dont want to go anywhere... will I have to live forever like this, I can't even talk to my parents normally, they are sad for me, but I myself can't be happy for any reason, just depressed house, very bad vibes giving environment...) •Very bad restless legs, i have to keep moving shaking my legs while laying or sitting, I felt numbness, weak thigh muscles and leg muscles, making me keep shaking it to feel good, but that doesn't make change either.•Not severe constipation, but unclear stomach, feeling to poop again, gassy stomach, bad taste of foods, not feeling urge to eat much, stomach mostly upsets and causes pain in stomach, occurs immediately next day I eat some street food..•Fatigue, constant fatigue and nauseous while doing and activity, I left gym because of this.. and I never wanted to quit, and it even makes me more angry and agitated irritated that I can no more do things I liked.. •Always irritated mood, angry, sad, no interest in any hobby or activities, unable to make eye contact, depressed mood.. •Life not looking comfortable to live.. I always wake up with the first thought ""one more day, same feeling, uncomfortable, unhappy) I realise I become very normal, happy while I'm in dreams, I felt normal I used to be.. but when I wake up, suddenly body starts feeling shrink, and thought of depressed entered in mind just 3 seconds after waking up. •Body regular feels like fever, little temperature increase, even my body hairs pain sometimes like u feel in fever.. •Feel too much cold, can't even bathe without shivering, even though it's summer time here.. -------------------Some medicines I remember different doctors prescribed me •gabatin, gabapentin (to increase gaba receptors)•rifaximin rifatin (for liver maybe)•escitalopram (for depression)•ciplar la 20mgMaybe some milk of magnesia, some medicines, some pills for stomach gas, bloating..

hi all i dont want to make this a sob story but heres background i guess. i recently moved to a different state because of arguments in my old house. i decided it would be a good idea to move away from the situation because it was getting scary being there. my plan was to move and do college somewhere else but ever since ive moved ive been struggling horribly. ive never been in this type of predicament ever in my life until now. im struggling daily to get a proper meal my fridge is empty and im also struggling to even buy gas. i have asked people on the help subs for help and they all kind of shun me because im requesting help i just dont understand what to do i cant keep living like this my body hurts from the malnourishment sometimes and it affects my thinking really bad. at this point if this continue for longer i dont see my self making it through this and this is not to scare anyone or even my family but i cant do this anymore i cant keep crying and keep begging for money on here i cant keep going in the same loops daily im tired of it all i feel like ive failed everything idec anymore sorry for ranting ,0

"I am currently living with my parents and I have applied to more jobs than I can count (at least 30+) and I havent been getting even rejection letters. Miraculously i stumbled myself into two interviews which should have made me feel a little better about my situation. then my mom comes into my room and screams about how lazy i am and how i hate being told to do chores, and how much i just LOVE to lay around in my messy room and do NOTHING for her. Its like this every day. verbal abuse because she thinks im lazy and just dont want to be in a clean room. every day i try to not off myself and she has the audacity to come and tell me how im lazy and do nothing for her. as a fellow woman, i understand her frustration. as her daughter, i feel nothing but contempt. there are thousands of other ways she could go about asking me to do something as simple as put some dishes away. i have very bad adhd so when i walk past something, my brain doesnt go ""Oh! Dishes in the sink, and theyre mine! Better clean them up right now!"" it just doesnt work that way but her and my father both scream to their hearts content on ""WHEN YOU SEE THINGS LIKE THIS, PICK THEM UP AND PUT THEM AWAY!!!"" and when i try to tell them ""My brain doesnt do that like yours does"" they dont belive me, just like when i tell them ""I sit around all day because im depressed and cant bring myself to do anything more than rot"" they go ""Well you sure get up when your friends want to hang out!"" and refuse to believe that im more than just lazy. i wish i could tell them that those friends are the reason im still living. my dad even told me that i needed to ""change (my) attitude"", ""(I) cant think like that, (I) have to stop thinking like that"", ""(I) have to stop worrying about things all the time"" when i described how depressed i was. he doesnt understand that depression isnt a state people choose to be in, like being in a bad mood. if i dont get out of this house and into my own place i will not make it out of here alive. every day cant be ""you didnt do enough for the house today, stop being so lazy!"" its like a pit of quicksand. im really begging for these interviews to go well so i can move out in the fall. i have money from my grandpa to cover housing but i need income to buy food, pay bills, ect.

"Long story kinda short: was on a low dose benzodiazepine and LOW dose Zoloft for 22 years. Did fairly well. Was motivated, enjoyed many activities but not all. Had some partial erectile dysfunction a couple of years ago and went off the Zoloft (it was only 20mg/day, over that and my nervousness got out of hand and was 24/7). Felt fine for about 8 months off it (still was on the benzo), then I started to notice a blah feeling, flat, things were not as enjoyable. That slowly worsened in the winter until I had a real depressive episode. Tried tryptophan, it was a mixed bag and gave me some autonomic issues and some insomnia. Then tried to get on the zoloft again, and even a low dose was horrible the 2nd time around. Heart issues, postural tachycardia that was bad in the mornings, insomnia worsened, blood pressure went up significantly. So I quit the zoloft again. I tried some different supplements (a slow tapering off on the benzo to this day), and felt fairly good for a couple of months. Now it seems like every time I try a supplement that ""works"" it helps for a month or two and then I'm back to my same flat, unenjoyable state. I sometimes even get brief thoughts of why is life worth living if I can't enjoy it. It seems like I simply cannot appreciate what I have for some reason. It's all there in front of me but I can't enjoy it or be content with it. The supplements that originally helped were 1000mg/day Niacinamide, then 650mg/day Betaine/Trimetylglycine. Now I'm popping 25mg straight Niacin sometimes, and that boosts mood quickly but it's temporary. I don't want to get a tolerance for it and start taking it like 6 times a day, but maybe I'll have to in order to keep my mood at a certain level. On the flip side, I'm 1/2 done tapering off the benzodiazepine and am doing fairly well with that, better than I thought. So basically I have a low mood without prominent anxiety now (used to be the opposite 25 years ago). Any suggestions for someone who doesn't do well at all with SSRI's. ",0

"I’ve suffered from depression since I was 12 years old, now I’m 30. I have the apartment I’ve always wanted, my career is going well, I have an incredible group of friends, the most perfect partner who I’m so in love with and he treats me so well. My parents are both still alive, still together and are there for me, I have the best relationship with my partners parents and sister, we’re middle class and doing ok financially. I’ve finally got a hold of my disordered eating, I’m medicated for my anxiety and depression, I’m in therapy and very self aware. I have many hobbies, I’m active and attractive and well liked, I spend my weekends with friends or travelling. This is the best life can get. And it’s still just a little bit fucking shit. I’m still constantly battling overthinking, I’m bored and I keep thinking “is this really it? This is the best it gets?”. I find myself more and more these days hoping for my death or the end of the world. I wish I’d never been born, I have to suffer daily knowing all my loved ones or going to die, I’m going to die, I cannot control anything around me and even living a life of privilege is still fucking shit. How can I do this for another 60 years? This is torture. Knowing that you just have to be grateful and accept the flow of the river and be present, don’t give any weight to my thoughts is fine but it’s not really fucking good enough. After all that, when I go through my best moments - it’s still just not quite good enough to be worth the pain of existence. I would never ever doing anything to myself that would leave my loved ones traumatised, that’s not what this post is.

"hey all so i’m (20f) and about two weeks ago my mom (55f) made a trip about halfway across the country to “scout out” a small town where she wants to move to in the coming years for her retirementat the moment i live with her in a 800ish square foot apartment nearly a 14 hour drive away from where she visited, and when she came back after 5 days she sat me down and asked how i would feel about moving with my boyfriend (20m) into the apartment we share (we have lived here almost 6 years, my name has not been on the lease due to my own struggles during high school, i graduated 3 years late and i have never had a job so have not been able to be put on the lease to pay rent)so since she has been back ive been putting in job applications like crazy (20-30 a day) and am working towards getting my drivers license so that i will be “all set” in her words for when she leaves. at first, she wanted to start the process in the next 1-2 years, which turned into about a year, which is now probably going to be not even a year. i have never been away from my mom like this in my life, i know it probably sounds incredibly childish and stupid but the thought of her moving away permanently and possibly for the rest of her life makes me incredibly sad and overwhelmed. i know i probably just need to suck it up and do my best to get a job but at the same time i feel so sad and overwhelmed and like i have no idea what to do",0

"I am a fifteen year old girl and this is my first post after lurking for some time now; I really need help with my binge eating.I've been doing this since November 2023, starting off as wanting to lose a few pounds for a nice event, and fast, so I resorted to completely water fasting for days at a time; and stuck to ED twitter to motivate myself (I suspect that's what caused me to be so intense in the first place.. It romanticized starving heavily.)Long story short, I lost the ten pounds in 3 weeks (mostly water weight), then quickly gained back around fifteen in the weeks after the event. I felt so guilty, and fast forward another few months, I kept going in the binge-restrict cycle, but gaining more than I lost.      I either was fainting from now five-day water fasts, or passing out from week-long bingeing until I nearly threw up. Then eating again when I felt the tiniest pang of 'hunger'.Around Febuary, I reach my highest weight I've been in a while, 141 lbs. (I'm 5'4) I feel miserable, and starting the new semester of 9th, I decide to starve again; and it finally works, bringing me down to 135, then quickly to 129.   By 129, my friend tells me the guy (my age) I had a crush on last semester actually likes me, and him and I start talking, quickly going for a date (walk + music) together.     It was so sweet, and innocent, and I felt happier than I did in a long time; plus this was the first time I had ever had someone interested in me, so I was elated; I really, \*really\* liked him.     We even had opened up about our weight issues, he told me about how he had to deal with intensely counting calories and training for his wrestling, and with how he spoke about it (and how he looked; muscular for a boy our age), I could tell he was very disciplined. I (and I regret this, it was too insecure, even for me) told him about my issues and how I thought I looked really fat/chubby, and he looked at me in shock and said something against it (I don't remember), and said he thought I was very pretty. I still have a hard time believing this, I'm relatively 'thick', I guess it's called, but I am very, very ugly when I'm not wearing makeup. I can't even bear to look at myself in the mirror without it. But thankfully, I look around a five or six with it on.     Meanwhile this boy is a solid ten, and has dated other 'ten' girls in our grade, all of whom were skinnier than me (and extremely skinny, actually) and looked perfect with minimal makeup.A few days later, he dumps me. And on Valentines day. He didn't tell me why, said it was 'for the better', and I suspect it may have been that one insecure comment I made (though I was confident for the rest of our conversations), along with how strict his parents were.     Anyways, without this closure, I got into a depressed state again (it never feels bad enough to be called a 'depression'), and ruined all my progress from 127 lbs, by then, to 141. My new highest weight. It was higher than the one I had even started at back in November, 135, and even in Febuary.     The day I saw that weight, something changed, on March 11. I decided, I would start again. To be healthy. Except I was still practically starving myself, just \*willingly\* eating a four-digit amount of calories, then (1100-1150), instead of doing it on a binge. On top of that, I worked out for two hours a day, every day (even on weekends), and did 10k steps at least, and drank 6L of water a day, at least. And I finally made it! I had gotten to 123 lbs. I hadn't been that light since November, when I had starved myself, and gotten to 120.6 lbs. Everything felt good, surprisingly. I was happy, I had been eating good, healthy foods, I had been doing better in school, I had mended my relationships with my friends, and could even look at myself, all of me, in the mirror (even bare faced, I had lost enough face fat to like how I looked there, too!), and appreciate my body.      Until I got the strongest binge urge, on April 27, and caved in.     Tons of chocolate, fruits, bread, spreads, treats, ice cream; I even mixed a cup of flour with sugar and butter, to make my own 'cookie dough', and had it \*again\*, when it wasn't enough. I was so bloated and pained that I think I had gotten sick, just from that, and stayed home for the next few days. Those days, I kept on bingeing. All day, even while I did my school work. I would have the highest calorie things like pecans with honey, cheese; but the worst was the time I even polished off a Kirkland 1kg (I think) tub of peanut butter. Start to finish. Mixed with jams and honey. I was so miserable, but held up, for the last few months. I tried to convince myself that I \*could\* do it, 'bounce back' as they say, but I only kept growing bigger; getting depressed again from the unhealthy food, and even more depressed and stressed about how the guy I had liked now percieved me. I had bet he thought I was the biggest pig ever, especially after I had told him I was going on a cut, all the way back in Febuary, but now was eating so much and always bloated and puffy.     Fast forward again. It's the end of exams, the last day of school. I see my weight is 145 lbs. An all-time high; even worse than in grade 8, when I was a pretty big girl. Now, I completely lost it, went on a 700 calorie 'diet', re-installed Twitter for the EDtwt content to 'trigger' (motivate me). But, I failed pretty soon, and kept trying again until I got sick of it, though I went down to around 135 lbs. Now, I'm balancing 135-140, depending on the day. I still feel so ugly and horrendous. I look in the mirror and all I see is my fat and acne-covered, scar-covered (I relapsed, after two years, in my SH in May, after my first few binges since 123 lbs.) I hate myself, I hate my life, I can't see any good in my life, and I feel like I will never be loved, because of how thick I am, unless it's for something sexual; as all the other girls my age with my body type are getting attention for. I can't watch the animes I love, because I feel like the characters would judge me, in real life. Same goes with my favorite songs, and movies. I can't even read my favorite books as I used to, because I very often enjoy self-inserting, but I know that the characters I admire would all think I am too chubby. All I can do to cope is go on forums like these and eat, eat, eat until I pass out and can dream about a better life, where I'm skinny and someone loves me how I wanted that guy to love me. Thankfully, I did quit twitter, and still haven't re-joined.     I guess this is all just a rambling vent-ish thing. But I desperately need help. I feel like my one chance to get skinny and better was in March, but I messed it up forever by bingeing in April, and ever since. I need better advice than ""drink water, eat veggies, brush teeth"", IT HAS NEVER WORKED. I have tried it, countless times. We can't afford therapy, and my nutritionist doesn't help at all. Whenever I try to explain to her or my family that this binging makes me miserable, they all are just like ""well, it's good you're eating.""     Nobody cares. They keep buying junk. I'm too young to leave, too busy with school-related stuff to get a job to fund an exit, even. I have no one close enough to talk to about this. I have journalled for hours at a time and it's never helped. I feel hopeless.    I just need help. I am at the end of my wits, or however it's said. I am writing this as I just finished a family-sized box of nuts and raisins, the first time in a bit; just another binge in this stupid fucking summer. I was supposed to be 85 lbs by now. Instead, I'm 137 (I can only guess, I'm on vacation).     I feel like my life is over, these eating habits have been ingrained in me for so long.",0

"I'm a 17 years old boy, born in Japan and raised in Brazil. My family including me are awkwardly super inept, misunderstood or missing timing of things to say, pretty much in the Asian family portraits/stereotype. It has been really tough to deal with myself unawareness and unconsciousness facing convos being socially anxious, totally blanking out, shaking my hands or moving too much my body not being able to fully look at the others eyes. I have been founding myself in deplorable situations through my life. Such as in primary school, other kids really enjoyed tricking me or doing wrong things and blaming me for what they had done, making me the one in the Manager's room. Even if I were not involved in that. Or elementary school, in which I had a lot of ""friends"", thus making me feel more comfortable and free, landing me to take bad decisions. Such as when I was playing with a ball alone, a guy just came and kicked the ball far away to make me run for the ball and I simply decided to kick his ass. Ending up with me receiving his knees in my inner pants parts and being blamed by everyone. The guy that harmed me in the down parts wasn't blamed for anything. And In high school where I'm currently in, I was claimed as racist for saying that prejudicing yellow people is also considered racist, everyone including the teacher called me racist for that reason. Because racism is only applied to black people and xenophobia for yellow people. And I didn't know that, but I also wanted to try convincing or explaining why it's also considered racism. By using historical facts that MIGHT reasonate in some way. Continuing in high school, this time I decided to not make friends and isolating myself. I was in a moment of completely change and decided then so. But changing myself by myself was a completely mistake. Not being auto sufficient to self development and getting fulfill overwhelmed by pressure and stress due the course I'm doing, automation. Started to feel insomnia not getting to fall as sleep properly, sleeping only 1 to 4 hours a day, pretty much making me lose control of myself and awareness. Since I am too tired to think or even read properly, I can be totally compared to a drunk if analyzing my capability to think due the preveusly told things.  I have been always trying to explain everythings, always feeling the necessity to write essays explaining and apologising. Or talking non stop about something bad I have said or done and trying to recovering the lost. Perhaps in hope to be understood by the other. And having my apologies overall accepted by the others that I have a affection to. Because I want to be their friends, but they no longer wants to be friends with me.  I always try to point my own mistakes to other people, and it probably give them the impression I'm victumising myself. My mom victumises herself a lot and I don't want to blame her for something I could just not be, I'm still thinking she perhaps influenced me. Being barely my only reference (my dad left me to my mom and I've never met him). People hates when someone starts to point there own mistakes, overthinking and I feel that so have I. Sometimes depending on my ""mood"" I act completely the opposite of everything said before and just so sudden people starts to like me. But who already know me by the main side, regardless refuses to give me a chance or anything. I don't know if it's a diseases, but probably it isn't (I was thinking it could be bipolarity, since my nickname at elementary school was bipolar). I have been trying to improve a way to approach people being completely honest about barely 50% in 10 about anything (around the 4 in 10 cases being truly honest about something) which haven't been working well... Being honest most of the time isn't very attractive for the people. Or being truly honest only in appropriated moments have been working well, but not essentially. I'm probably not skilled enough to do any good improvement. Although, I can develop convos about barely anything, which is sorta contradictory. If I can talk about barely anything how can I not develop it.  It has been roughly 3 years of pain and falling apart. Not being able to make a self statement or being comprehended by anyone. I think my life had not being so hard since I got into primary school. Being sexually harassed by the school's manager at 10 in front of everyone at school, some teachers got mad at the manager. But nothing happened to him. I don't know if everything what I said can form a understandable statement or a completely falacia.  During the pandemic and high school period certainly was the periods which I started feeling more depressed and emotional (I was 13 at the beginning of the pandemic), due to again my family pressure and general changes that the body naturally develops during that period (adolescence). Sometimes I feel like I wanted to hit my head against something or break everything. I'm losing the interests all my interests I had before and not getting new ones. Everyday that passes through it feels worse. I used to go to therapy but I decided to quit due to not making me feel better and it wasn't the truly me there. I just mess up with barely anything I touch I appreciate so much for reading till the very end. I will be probably claimed as a awkward person to be around, as many people say ""red flag"". ",0
"I'm 25 y/o and a couple of weeks ago I failed my nursing licensure test on my first attempt. Now, I know this happens to many people but this made my depression worse than it already was. When I found out, I cried, isolated myself, didn't do any form of hygiene, and just never left my house. I had dark thoughts as well (I did not act on them). Most or all of my classmates passed on the first attempt and I feel alone in not passing on the first time like them. Recently, I went on vacation and came back last week and it was a nice break from my normal routine. But then I looked at the date and noticed today was the day I was supposed to start my job. I just got sad all over again. My roommate be starting today but I won't. I just feel alone in this. I feel worthless and inadequate. Today just serves as a reminder of that because I couldn't pass the test. I know comparison is the thief of joy but I can't help but compare myself to my roommate, my peers, and my friends who are becoming registered nurses, and I am still stuck at the testing stage. I feel like a failure because my family was rooting for me to pass and I gave them confidence I could pass and then I failed.

"hi everyone. i’ve been feeling really weird lately. i’m beginning to wonder what the point of life actually is. it seems so pointless to me, because the only biological reason we’re here is to reproduce. additionally, my boyfriend of 6 months whom i love dearly is moving soon which will start a minimum of 4-5 years of long distance. he’s amazing and i don’t have a reason to not trust him but the thought of not seeing him like once a week triggers some of these depressive episodes. some other triggers are waking up in the morning or being scolded. i also have adhd. should i talk to a counselor/what are your thoughts?",0
"I'm in my 30's and since I was 26-27 I started to feel empty. I have always been accomplished in most things I have done, so a lot of people will say ""oh but there's not reason for you to feel like that"", etc. I had a fairly good childhood, supporting family, never been through any out of the ordinary trauma. Studied an engineering degree, I have been sucessful in my jobs, I have been lucky enough to travel the world as one of my passions, learned languages, created meaningful connections with people, you name it. Last year this emptiness started to become even worse and I think I tried to compensate by having excesses: traveling way too much, going out with friends almost everyday, endulging in wine 3-4 times a week, taking for granted my 7yr relationship with my partner (who I love with all my heart). Although I did put plenty of effort into the relationship as well, all of this took a toll in the relationship itself and ended up in a breakup. And since then all that emptiness I was already feeling became a lot lot worse, combined with the sense of loss and grieving. I was already going to therapy and since the breakup I decided to take the process more seriously, started on meds provided by a psychiatrist, group therapy, talking to people around me I considered might be of help. I have tried to take on old hobbies, find new ones and all the typical advise in this situation. But still, that emptiness still there and now I miss my ex like crazy.  And months into therapy, meds and trying everything I can think of, I'm now feeling tired and some days even passively suicidal. I don't have any desire to leave my room or interact with people, just wishing one of these mornings I don't wake up. I feel utterly miserable. I try to keep telling myself that this is temporary and to hold on to the thought of happy moments that will probably never come back. On the few occasions when those passive-suicidal thoughts turn into more active thoughts, the only thing that keeps me from moving forward with those is avoiding my mom such terrible pain.I don't know how to make this emptiness stop and the emotional pain that comes with it.",0

"I am male, 26 yrs old, and I struggled with depression since I started university and during the first one and a half years, I could still differentiate my episodes (without knowing that it was depression). Since early 2020, I could not differentiate the episodes anymore. I guess, it became chronic. I had some not so nice ""frienships"" during my first terms and most of them just used the relationship to get all of the university material from me and...well, I guess I was just ""the student, who can give you this and that when you need it"". During the first three terms, I had clear episodes with  the typical ""healthy periods"" in between, but I was dropped out of those ""friendships"". I am a very emotional person and I guess, it is not easy as a young man. I thought, I found someone, I could relate to. She also made me come to her so that she could cry her eyes out on my shoulder, she walked beside me with her arm in my arm, but when I tried to explain to her, that she always ""spit at me"" with anger, when something upset her, she could not handle that, she told me, that I am ""too emotional for her"" and that was more or less the last thing, that more or less made the depression chronic. I was excluded from our ""trio"" (two girls and me) more or less immidiatly and it came out  I fell....deep into the dark.  I did not know it was depression, but when I finally visited a doctor, in late 2022, because my weight was dangerously low due to my decreased appetite, I was put on Citalopram. That med worked for two to three weeks on the highest dose, but it stopped working since then and I've tried multiple other options since then (Sertraline Venlafaxine, Bupropion, a combination of Venlafaxine and Bupropion, Citalopram once again and I am about to start Duloxetine now).Therapy did not really help me. I could attend a few lectures during the last two terms, but all while going through that with anxiety. I literally want to get out of the lectures all the time. I had many, many conversations with my mother. She tries to understand and so on, but my father and my sister are not understanding. I try all I can, I really am, but they don't get that I am afraid to form new bonds, because of all those ""fake friends"" I found during my first terms. My father and my sister don't get that it is hard for me to form bonds. I don't want to meet my sister's friends, I just don't. I feel like, I can not connect to anybody. ",0

"Been depressed since I started high school at about 11. A few suiceide attempts here and there,(one this year), a looot of unhealthy decisions and mistakes made along the way and a particualrly long black spell that lasted months(beginning late last year) and I finally caved and saw a psychiatrist, at my mother's behest. For context, I'm an international student studying quite far from from home and I'm in my 3rd year now. If it were me, I'd just grit my teeth and bear with it but I guess I didn't want a repeat of my first breakdown which ended in me dropping out and heading home(this was right before Covid).So yeah, partially the only reason I'm doing this is because my school has free counselling/therapy and I know how expensive that stuff can get from what my graduated friends have told me. I'm also sure that this is the first time I've just openly talked with a stranger face-to-face(sober) and just, i don't know, talked about me? Without any masks or pretenses, it's a bit strange but maybe it's like that at first all the time.Mainly w riting this because it's hard to express how negatively I virw it. I feel exposed, I can't sleep, it feels like I'm in crosshairs.

When I have to go to school I feel really shitty, I'm not bullied, grades are average, not bad but not amazing, all my teachers are nice and yet I dread going so much I've considered suicide, it just feels like it's wasting my life. My home life is ok, nothing to complain about. But I rarely feel happy anymore, sometimes I'll watch some shows or play a video game or read a book, but the instant I remember none of it is real the empty hollowness that just makes me feel like I want to die.I have no clue why I feel like this. My will to live is basically non-existent and I'm pretty damn tired of my pathetically short and bland life",0

"I was bullied for being Asian five years ago, and I still struggle with the trauma. I remember being called names like chxngchxng and told to go back to your country. I did have some friends who liked kpop but they sometimes looked down on me and my country. When I confided in them about the struggles, they said I was being too sensitive. It was kind of obvious since I was the only asian but still.. I became paranoid thinking everyone's a racist and cut ties with everyone i knew, even those from my own country. I cut myself and tried to commit suicide so my parents decided to move to canada. Even in canada I was too scared to make new friends, even asian ones. I've been on medication since i came here but it hasn't helped. My concentration has suffered due to depression, affecting my studies. I was supposed to graduate this year but need an extra year. My parents want me to go to university, but I'm not sure if I can handle it. I'm also afraid of being surrounded by foreigners. Returning to my country isn't an option because I don't speak the language fluently.I hate how I keep complain without making any effort. I know I need to try but I lack in motivation to improve my life. I just want it all to end. Is there any way I can find motivation?",0
"I take an SSRI for anxiety and it works great, unfortunately the side effect is that I am heavily sleepy and motivation is low. Caffeine partially reduces drowsiness, but weakly and short-lived. This is more due to the effect on paroxetine dopamine after prolonged use.    150mg of pregabalin makes me ultra-productive, active, full of energy for 24 hours. Can someone explain to me why? According to the internet, its effect on dopamine is not very great.    I rather not want to take pregabalin long-term, too much risk of addiction, I just wanted to know why it affects me so much. Several people here also wrote that it has a stimulating effect on them. I'm interested what exactly is the process here.    I don't take anything else, just a vitamin complex.",0

"I'd like to apologize in advance as this post is just me wallowing in self-pity.I don't know how to start this. I can't focus, I mess things up, talking to me probably feels like talking to a wall. I hate myself for even thinking at one point that the whole world against me, when I don't. I hate myself even more that some people don't seem to think that way. I'm too quiet, too passive, can't stand up for myself. I hate myself for keeping bottling my feelings and keeping things to myself. I don't know how to act when being comforted and I don't know what to do when comforting someone. I'm a bad daughter for not providing comfort to my mother who obviously just cried. It hurts me that my brother knows that she had always cried ever since dad died and this is the first time I see it.I'm a bad sister for being sa choosy, lazy and spoiled.I'm a bad friend for thinking the worst about my only friends. For crying and going to them during a emotional breakdown when they probably have it worse and not expecting that out of me. And I'm scared that they don't want to go to me when their the ones having a bad day. I hate the feeling of a day where everything is just normal, then somehow my heart start to feel heavy, or when I overthink and think of the worst case scenario only for it to be completely go alright. Last crying/breakdown session I had was a month ago, and it was all because I couldn't find an object that was going to be important for school later on. I feel bad for bringing jt up to my mother. Proving time and time again that I'm so out of my head and not aware of my sorroundings. I'm careless. I had sh myself over losing a thing, and now I have done it again simply because I can't stand to go back to school tomorrow. I suffer under so much pressure and deprecation that I have put on myself. How do I even explain that to people. Oh yes I hate myself so much because of what my brain thinks about myself and I have a completely normal life whatsoever. Never been abused or bullied, can you believe that?I just can't. Some days I feel like I'm just whining. Sure I might be crying now, but tomorrow I know I'll be alright and I might fool myself that I am actually fine, what if what I'm worrying about right now was never a problem in the first place. despite all that self-awareness, I would still repeat the cycle of feeling absolutely the worst to ""oh wait things are actuallt quite nice"" I don't know what to do with myself.",0
"Ever since I moved in to my current residence 7 years ago my roommate has began to display strange behaviors. The displays seemed at first to be a product of mental disability, depression coupled with a form of autism but I've come to the conclusion that there's an aspect of silent envy to this problem. My roommate has told me he has ptsd and for the first two years I lived here he seems to for the most part mind his own space and business and would watch TV in his living room. But slowly over time has developed this strange behavior where he now stays and lurks in his room all day with his door open in silence right across from my room so he can hear everything I'm doing. At first I thought he was just getting some peace and quiet. But then I realized as it became more apparent when he would literally do it consistently for the entire day and night and react to anything I did, if i left the house, had someone over etc. Then he started doing this weird shit where would somehow know whent I go to bed and he would go to bed at the same exact time as me every single night and wake up the same time in the morning. This made me uncomfortable because its suggesting he literally is such a weirdo that he lurks in his room and just listens to what im doing all day. He'll time things perfectly to act like he's doing something like walk into the kitchen at 2 am right I've turned my light off and got on my bed and lurk and stand next to my door in the dark to the point where I've thrown shit at the door and alled him names like wtf are you doing I can hear you fat moron! I've also caught him several times standing in the dark behind his door late at night waiting for me to come out of my room to go to the bathroom. I've called him out on his retarded behaviour and told him he better learn to stop it or I'm going to wind up in prison in day for taking a router router drill to his eardrums. Which isn't me I don't want to and have never hurt anyone but this person has made my life miserable to the point I'm borderline psychotic.its like their entire existence is out of silently lurking envy of my existence. And they are so depressed and retarded they can't understand themselves to help it so there's nothing I can say or do to change it and I think that fat sloth demon knows that shit! So he continues doing what he does lurking and eavesdropping on my business and life making me feel uncomfortable everyday because that's all he can do. Which is pretty sad and pathetic if you ask me. Makes me wonder what kind of retard does it take to sit there all day and listen to what your goddamn roommate is doing. Fucking retarded. ",0

"I just turned 26, and I am not where I had hoped to be. In short, I was in college for tv/film and working at a coffee shop in 2022. I left the coffee shop after a semester for what I didn’t know at the time was a big MLM scheme, supposedly fundraising for scuicide prevention. So at the end of the year, when I was done with MLM nonsense, come to find out I am barred from coming back to the school because my grades were so low and I was out for over two semesters. So back to sales jobs. The following year I sold phones, got fired, worked at a theater summer camp I used to be a student at, they didn’t keep me on board after the summer. So this September will be 1 year into delivering for Amazon. I did just buy a car with a year’s worth of savings too,but now the transmission is fucked. Really tight on money now. I feel like I’m there because I fucked up. Which sucks to realize as your delivering hella boxes. I love music and visual art and nature. I just feel like it’s too late to get a realistic salary doing what I love. I feel like I’m stuck in this Amazon warehouse with all these people who do not care about my life (rightfully so). Just starting to not want to live, I feel like I’m just bound to the outcomes of my consequences. I’m don’t want to be an Amazon deliver guy all my life, sure feels like what’s happening though… And I know if I died, at least I would be free from it all indefinitely…",0
"I feel like I'm living in someone else's life where nothing actually affects me but everything that I see makes me want to curl up in a corner. I hate myself there's no way around it. I'm a coward who cannot finish myself off but the will to live or survive is gone. Having graduated a while back I see others' ambitions and plans for future and I can't do the same because thinking about having to live longer and more makes me want to barf. But when I say I'm in hell I donot mean how I feel but rather where I am. Having lived in a toxic environment throughout childhood, and now realising I have to take care of the people who hurt me still with every sentence they utter because its a brown household, having nowhere and nobody to escape to, getting myself out of the bed every morning only to find myself alone, aimless and drowning, going to work to realise things that were easy to me a year back feels gruelling, as if my brain is getting dumber, fuzzier as everything becomes harder to concentrate on. In my mom's words, for a girl without any talent the only good thing I had was my brain, which I donot believe works anymore. I don't want to do this anymore but i don't know how it will end either because, as i said, I'm a coward.  ",0

The trans boy who sounds like a girl. The moron who doesn't know how to talk to people. The fucking piece of shit god put on this earth just to make everyone's life harder. I don't want to kill myself. But i've told myself for years that it's going to get better and it hasn't yet. How much longer do i have to wait?

"I'm so brutally scared of interacting with people. There's been so many times in my life that people have randomly switched up on me I'm genuinely scared of people. There's been so many people in my life that has randomly switched up on me. I don't want to die but I don't want to live here anymore. I have such a warped view of life I don't even know what to think anymore. I seriously think I'm living in hell all I remember is terrible memories. I've been harassed so many times in my life and every single time I've had to just suck it up. I don't care what anyone says anymore this world is evil. We all live in hell we just pass the suffering around too eachother. I'm a devout Christian but I'm having doubts about god. I don't know if he's genuinely as powerful as he's claimed to be. I don't understand how god could ever allow evil to ever exist in the first place, he's god the creator of literally everything how could he ever give us a conscious and soul to live. Did god allow evil to exist because he's insecure and needs us to suffer just to make sure were being genuine with our love? How could I ever reciprocate love back to god when love has never genuinely been reciprocated to me? I genuinely despise my father for the things he's done to me and my mother did indeed raise me but it was never out of love, I was always just a burden to her. she did it out of not wanting to be called a bad mom infront of her friends and family. All she ever did to me was complain that I wasn't like other kids and then when I tried being like ""other kids"" (aka hanging out the very few friends I had by none other than the short side of a miracle) she would always threaten me and tell me that if I didn't behave she would kick me out and make me live with my drug addicted dad disown me etc. I don't know how to show love to anyone I don't know how to even act like a proper human being I've been so isolated my whole life.

"hello haha i never imagined myself downloading reddit and even posting something here but here I am. Idk how this works. I don't even know if people would notice my post but here's my story (bare with me bcs hindi ako marunong magkwento)Incoming fourth year college na sana ako, but there's this one prof from last sem which really frustrated the whole class and the other section. He's known sa paghihingi ng money in disguise as a donation daw kapalit ng grades.I was on his good side, ako yung minemessage sa mga classes namin last sem and kung may mga tanong siya. One night, during summer break na 'to around 9pm, he asked for my whereabouts and even called na hindi ko sinagot due to uncomfort kasi nga late na. I politely replied parin and then he told me about a class meeting daw sa isang park malayo sa school. The place and time of the meeting is inconvenient sa commuters kasi wala ng mga dorm dahil nga summer break. I forwarded the message on our class gc and I jokingly labeled him ""gagi, pisti, and kalamri"".Someone snitched me and sent my message to him and he threatened to press charges. I kept on asking apology to him but he insists na magkakaso siya and ipapa-expel ako and there's a possibility daw na makareceive ako ng warrant. I was so anxious that I couldn't eat and sleep. I've been harming myself na rin which was my usual coping mechanism  I met him ulit and handed him my personal apology letter kasama ang ilang classmates but then, sa korte na daw ako magpaliwanag. Before ending that meeting, he told me to meet him alone and I did out of so much fear. On that meeting, he asked me to give him 10,000 which he claimed to be the lawyers fee daw na ibinayad niya, if maibalik ko daw yun, he will ask his lawyer to file a motion to wash the case. He doesn't want me to let my parents know about it and not even my closest friends.I am not really good at handing situations and feeling ko, walang solution sa problem ko. I've been wanting to kill myself dahil hindi ko na rin kinakaya yung thoughts ko and the heavy feeling in my chest. Breathing for me is extremely uncomfortable. Sana hindi nalang ako magising. ",0
Sigh. Another day waking up just to make the conscious decision to fall back asleep. I don’t want to be awake.The only sense of normalcy I feel is when I’m cuddling with my cats. I’m so glad I have them. The love I feel for them overpowers any will to die.

"So Friday my ex (whom I've lived with for 1.7 months past pur breakup ( because we have a 1 year old) Anyway he woke up at like 12:30 pm and I had been up with our soon since 6:30. So I was like ""I'm gonna go drink my coffee if you could get him (my son) a few drink . He He got mad and said he never just gets a minute to do anything ( he plays a cellphone game that has some event at that time of day. I got pretty upset, I have BPD and I won't lie... It set me off. I just couldn't understand how he thought he deserved more time before helping with his son when I had don it all morning. Well things escalated and at one point he starts screaming about how he just wants to take a shot and I won't let him ahit. He keeps yelling and so do I, he grabs a knife from his dresser and threatens to s/it his wrist if I don't shut up. Honestly I at first said I didn't care of but then I remembered my therapist said if he ever tried that again to just call th cops. So I did. He lost his mind. He scream ok neverind I'll stop, stabbed his metal dresser a few times and hit it with his head.  I stayed on the phone  and spoke to the operator , but Aaron kept yelling at me and saying how I just wouldn't let him shit and the operator tried to tell me to ignore him... But it was hard and I kept replying, because it wasn't as simple as he was trying to make it sound.  The operator ask if there are weapons in the house and I said knives and I guess they decided that meant my ex was armed because when they showed up they got pretty rough with him. They took him to the hospital and I wouldn't let him come back that night. The last thing he said to me was he was going to pass out so he was going to walk downtown. The next day I wanted talk some things through, wouldn't even answer the phone all day... The next day I called the local shelter and found out he was safe and there.  He now seems to be blame me for everything bad that every happen and I lie to my therapist and am manipulating everyone... Or at least that's what his homeless buddies thought he so kindly told me. Theythink I'm insane. May e I am... I just gave up and said he can come back... We have stipulations...  But I just don't care... I'm just a bad person and I don't even wanna be anymore... I wrote a letter to my son just to see how it would feel. I love him so much, but all I do is cause people burden and pain ...bno matter how many pills I take or therapy sessions I attended...

"When I was 14 years old, I attempted to take my own life. I was very young and foolish at the time, and I made a careless mistake that I deeply regret to this day. I was going through a rough time in my life. My mother left me, and my father was never really there for me emotionally. But one day, I confided in my school about this because I had no one else to talk to or help me. I thought they would keep this information private, but they didn't. So they sent me to the hospital where I was admitted for a few days. It wasn't the embarrassment of everyone seeing the ambulance arrive at my school, or the feeling of betrayal by my teachers that bothered me. What drives me crazy to this day is my father's reaction. Instead of comforting me when I was at my worst, he screamed at me, called me every name in the book in front of my teachers, and hit me multiple times. Since that moment, I've struggled with trust issues, social anxiety, depression, and a distant relationship with my father. It's hard for me to communicate with people and make friends. I am 24 years old now, and I still think about that moment. It affects me to this day.",0
"I’ve always had nihilistic and rational beliefs and views on life or world in general. It just seemed more logical to me to believe that nothing has to make sense. It just exists, life is not fair or unfair, it’s just the mind perceiving it. The good and bad do not exist unless one’s mind perceives it and judges.However since I’ve swallowed the blackpill it has opened a big hole in my soul that it’s getting progressively worse. Everything is greyish. I cannot see the beauty in life anymore. I’ve lost all the appetite. Been starving for 3 days now. Sleep is the one time I feel good because my mind is too tired to process anything so it’s like I stop existing for a short amount of time until I wake up with an extreme feeling of sadness and numbness, wishing it was just a dream. But it’s reality. I realised that I’m very emotional even though I try to hide and convince myself that I use logic, what I said above on the nihilistic views aren’t helping anymore. They’re making me worse. And I believe that hope is the one thing that keeps one alive.A man with no hope is a man dead. It all makes sense. Hope is the only thing that keeps man content. Hope to start a business one day so you can have financial freedom, hope to pursue a college degree to have a career. Hope to improve yourself to feel fulfilled and more attractive. Hope to find someone and have a family, not die alone.It’s hope, the only thing that keeps humans not go insane like me or other people going through similar experiences. Unless you are a monk of course or a very small percentage of people. I understand and believe that happiness is a state of mind but unfortunately I am just someone with traumas, anxieties and depression, I cannot become a monk or just press a button and become happy. I will always compare myself to other people and feel inferior. This feeling of inferiority and the massive fear of rejection has caused me to isolate myself and feel miserable.My mother tells me to be grateful because you are physically healthy and there’s people whose days are counting. Sure this is a solid and wise point to view. I never said I am not grateful for my health, but is it really living if now I see everything black and white?  I’ve always had social anxiety and terrible low self esteem ever since puberty hit me, which I haven’t done anything to help me but ignore, since my mother isn’t someone who considers mental health important. The terrible social anxiety I’ve had has caused me to be so lonely and introverted that I never approached anyone or talk to someone, which led me to absolute loneliness. I am someone very humble but very anxious to the point I’ve questioned if I’m autistic or is it really just social anxiety. We’re human beings. It’s in our DNA to want to socialize and have people around.Now that I’ve discovered the so called blackpill theory I’ve gotten devastated and absolutely crushed to the point I see no reason in wanting to improve myself and try to approach people. I’ve never been called as unattractive or ugly, instead I may have gotten compliments here and there. I am someone who is very analytical and introspective. I may be awkward sometimes due to my anxiety but once someone gives me a chance to talk and get comfortable I can talk about anything.TL;DR: I am a male in his early twenties who has always been insecure and socially anxious to talk to anyone or approach people with massive fear of rejection, which has now led to total isolation. Recently I have discovered the blackpill theory which states that looks is the most important factor in how people view you and your confidence. So not only was I insecure and shy before, but now I am absolutely crushed since I have to worry about not being a tall handsome model-looking male to go outside and meet people. I want to be social. I want a group of friends, a relationship too. If I was socially anxious to go out and talk to people or find people before,  now I’m absolutely hopeless and see no point in anything.Any answer and opinion on how can I improve and change my view on the world is appreciated.",0
I wake up every day wanting to end it. I don’t eat much and I don’t sleep very well. I just want to die in my sleep at this point.

"My mother keeps having these massive fights with my sister to the point of her threatening to leave the house and never come back or my sister ends up locking herself in her room and I'm always worried she will k!Il herself.

This time I'm particular my mother and sister had a massive fight which ended with my mother throwing my sisters food away. What sucks is that l'm not close to my sister at all, even plan to go non-contact with her once she leaves home.

My sister is dangerous and even though she's been offered therapy she won't take it or anything similar on that matter.

"I don't get why stories like Stranger Things or IT are so popular because I really can't relate to those characters.

I'm autistic and grew up socially isolated, and never even had the bare minimum of what normal kids have growing up. I don't recall ever going to the mall or movies with friends, never had the summer camp experience that you see in so many movies, and never had a birthday party with a bunch of friends to celebrate with. When I graduated high school it didn't seem to mean much and I just went home afterward. It really makes me hate the kids you see in those stories because they seem too idealized and I never met any real kids who were that nice or accepting. I don't find normal kids that relatable because I didn't have much positive interaction with them, and I don't know what it's like to have a group like that who look out for you, so I don't really get the appeal. I'd probably feel differently if I was still a kid or a teenager and still had hope but I think it's too late now. ",0
"I just want it all to stop. I just want one day where I don’t have any negative thoughts in my head. I just want to have a normal day. But there is no normal for me. There really hasn’t been since that day I was born. A spiral of misfortunes. The thoughts of stabbing myself keep playing in me head. The thoughts of walking into traffic has come back full force. I don’t know what to do. Nothing is going to help because I’m stuck in this stupid body of mine. No matter how much I wish this life wasn’t real, I’m stuck here. I’m just tired of the constant pain that I’m in. I keep looking up easiest ways to kill myself. I already know where I could get pills to swallow. And I already know where bridges are that I could jump off of. I’m easily replaceable, so it really doesn’t matter if I vanish. I don’t have my dog anymore because he passed away. So what’s the point for me to really live for? I have nothing. Never really had anything and never will gain anything. ",0
"Despite my achievements, from the outside it looks great, but I have growing concerns and problems every day. I struggle waking up, feeling like I just don't want to live on. My brain wants to kill me. It wants to hurt me. It wants to just stop. Why? Is it the pain, the trauma, all the sadness and heartbreaks from family, relationships, friends, work, and strangers? It's magnified, intensified. I'm depressed, sick. This is a disease. It's in my head. I want to get out of it. My body is in hell.

I just stay at home in the same room ive lived in all my life, with online friends, video games, and other shit I like keeping me from going down a spiral, and getting scarily close to suicidal tendencies. I live with my parents and they never seem to understand depression, and they let me live here for the foreseeable future, but it's still fucking awful and , was I raised wrong? am I just a lazy ass (wo)manchild? I want to eventually get a job, support myself, maybe go back to college this fall. but I never have the fucking energy and im just so fucking tired all the time, and I dont have friends to help me get out of here, my choices for living is basically here, or the streets, the housing market in my state is so bad everyone just lives in the surrounding states, so good fucking luck for me if I can ever move out, also theres 0 public transportation, so I need a car, which I dont have and probally can never afford at this rate.

"I had a really shitty day today. Which isn't all that strange. I've been depressed for four years now, been actively suicidal for that horrifying first year and passively for the other three.My parents don't really understand how mental health works and they dot believe in it either. They've been treating me like shit for a few years now and I thought I got used to it. Until today.Twently minutes ago, I nicked one of my dad's razors and made a few tiny cuts on my arm. I was only going to do one and that was only out of morbid curiosity but one I started I physically couldn't stop. I've made four now and freaked myself out enough to stop but l'm pretty sure l'm going to start again once the fear wears off.Due to my upbringing, I didn't actually think this would happen to me but yikes.How do I nip this in the bud before it snowballs out of my control?",0

"I have always been a sad child. My father hit me as a child brutally- Wooden rulers, metal rods, belts.. you name it. I was also sexually abused as a child by multiple people. I was fat-shamed and went to a catholic school where teachers constantly slut-shamed me.Then my parents sent me off to a boarding school and apart from harbouring feelings for a super straight girl, time there was nice. So, about this girl, she would constantly pull me close and push me away. Times when she would be with me the entire day and then disappear without explanation. I would cry and cry and cry and feel helpless.Then I went to university, and started feeling deeply inadequate about everything- my looks, my skills, my personality- everything. The first semester went by like this. Then, the pandemic happened and something In me clicked. I bought a foodscale, a weighing machine and started working out like 5 hours a day. Eating like 500 calories a day. Obviously, I lost weight, but I'd developed an eating disorder by then. All I thought about was my body and I couldn't stand to look in the mirror. Whatever I saw was so distorted, I had zero sense of my own flesh. Now the pandemic was over and I was back to university. Then started a long pattern of people- romantic interests, mostly- abandoning me. They would have sex with me and just.. leave. All of them. My bestfriend was the best human being in my life. He died by suicide. I was the one who found him. I screamed, shouted but no one came to help. Months later, a friend of mine and I just started having feelings for each other. We got into a relationship. I thought finally.. some happiness. But slowly, in the trenches of the relationship, I started feeling very anxious in the relationship. Feelings of deep abandonement. Fear of abandonement. The relationship started to suffer because my ex was also mentally ill, and I guess I was a lot to take in general. After a year of dating, they broke up with me. Thrice. And since then, things just unraveled. I became absolutely dysfunctional. I would drink the whole day and when I couldn't afford, I would have cough syrup. Or anything to keep me drunk/high. I was so anxious going outside my apartment. I saw ex everyday in college. I just couldn't stop going to college because I wouldn't pass without a 75% attendance. But that happened anyway. I left my exams. My degree (2-year Masters degree in clinical psychology) ended in April. I still have to give two exams I skipped, to complete my degree.In between this, I was on heavy Psychiatric drugs. As much as 15 in a day. Pretty sure I was abusing them as well. I am back home now, and no matter how hard I try I am persistently sad. I have been persistently sad all my life. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. I have tried all the meds there are, I've tried to kill myself multiple times. I am neither dead nor better. I try to visualise a future, but the past doesn't seem to leave. I can't study furthur because I still have to complete my degree. I don't know what to do. Dying isn't that easy, I've tried countless times. I don't know what do.",0
"i dont understand why i cant just be normal?? how does everyone else function without having to drag themselves to literally do anything i dont get it. i live somewhere where no one will ever accept me the way that i am, everyone is so conservative and stuck in old ways and so insanely religious that if i would ever come out as lesbian everyone would try and convert me. it got out at my old school that i wasnt straight and honestly i never would have taken bullying seriously if that hadnt happened. like i seriously cant understand why people cant let me just exist in peace, did i ever do anything to anyone to deserve this kind of pain? id rather be in hell knowing that my existence is wrong than live in this fucked up place i need to get out of here. i just wish i liked boys like any other girl. but is it really that wrong to love someone so much just because theyre not a boy? it cant be, right? idk maybe im js being dramatic",0

"first off, i know im a bad person. i just need to tell the truth for once, so i can feel like a man.okay so, me and my ex had been dating for 2 years. we both had our flaws, we were young, and eachothers first love. she did things, i did things, but what i did was way worse. in september of 2023 i commited my greatest mistake and sin.she was a special girl, at first she stayed with me and i swore to her i wouldn't do it again. but since then, she got further and further away from me. and i don't blame her for it. we were off and on but on the night of july 25th, she told me she was with someone else. i took it very badly because i still loved her (ironic, i know.) trust me, i know that i deserved for her to do that.i do regret it very much. i apologized to her a million different times, and i would do anything to make it up to her. i would do anything to warn myself, to change the past. i was a really bad boyfriend, but it only took something as tragic to realize that i was a bad boyfriend. i wish i could tell myself to be a better man so i wouldn't lose her.  i feel extremely guilty and depressed. i cry almost every day all day, even though i should not be the one crying. and i cannot take care of myself. when i look in the mirror, i see a boy who could not control himself. i lost the love of my life because i was so fucking stupid. since that night, i have been hung up on alcohol and weed. i also struggle to keep meals down and usually throw up alot. i also cut myself alot, because i feel as though someone as bad as me deserves to feel that pain.on top of it, im very jealous. i wish she was with me, and not him. but i know i shouldn't think that. i wish i didn't feel like this because i know im a bad person for doing this.what im basically asking is, how do i make it up to her? should i wait for her? she said she forgived me, and that she knows that i really would do anything to make up for her, but i feel like shes only saying that so i dont hate myself. the truth is that i do hate myself, and i can hardly look in the mirror.im not sure on how to be a better man. i know that i need to change, for her or for everybody. but im not sure how. i feel as though i will never be better than that boy in september who could not control his own body.i guess this post is open ended. if you want to comment bad things about me, that is fine. if you want to give me advice, that is fine. i need to know how to forgive myself, because i can hardly look in the mirror. i carry a great shame, and i just wish i had a time machine so i can tell myself to be better sooner. how do i make sure she knows that i would do anything to fix us? do i even have a chance of being with her again after what i did?she was my first love, and i still have very strong feelings to her. i know this is all ironic but i really just want to make it up to her one day. im struggling to move on because of my mistake. it feels like i will feel like this forever. im not sure if i could trust myself to date anyone else.thank you for reading this post if you did read all of it. i know im a bad person, but in making this, i hope i can become a better man for her.",0
"(please forgive any mess. I'm doing this on my phone and it's hard to type and fix anything)I'm over 50. Been suicidal since I was 14. Maybe even younger. I have dealt with severe migraines since I can remember. They made me quite crazy. Anyways. I'm currently stuck in a not great situation. But also. Even when I'm not, I can't seem to stay afloat. I have never had it somewhat easy. Life's always been extremely difficult. I just started having lots of health issues that are preventing me from trying to enjoy any semblance of normalcy.  Walks and doing anything that involve being on my feet are a thing of the past. Not that I have the energy to do anything. I haven't slept a decent night in years. I can't work. I can't do anything, and all I want to do is die. The wishing for death so badly has crippled me from getting anything done I feel like I can't move. I have zero will to live. I hate this life and everything in it. I've been in therapy since age 14. I'm currently on my 3rd round of dialectical behavioral therapy courses that are a year each. They have tought me skills to manage the depression supposedly. I can barely tell. I know the skills but I have no will to use them. I get pissed off when I see someone that has no hope and people just say. "" Get help"" What about the people that have had help their whole life. Help doesnt help. It almost makes it worse for a lot of people. I get it tho. Seems the go-to statement for anyone struggling is. ""get therapy"" I wouldn't know what else to say either. As I don't know what helps me feel better when I'm venting.no one can say the right thing so I basically hold it all in so I don't blow a gasket on someone. I've been more suicidal since ive been in 2 sessions of therapy a week. I feel like it takes all my time and energy. The days I have therapy are usually fucked afterwards. The emotional lifting I do in therapy is ridiculous. Anyways. I just don't know where else to turn for help. As nothing seems to. I wish I had the guts and the know how to just fucking end it. But I don't. ",0
"I feel so hopeless all the time and I don’t know what to do. I constantly feel homesick and a deep painful longing for something or someplace that I can’t define. I feel like everyone is constantly thinking about how much of a stupid, ugly, antisocial, ungrateful, overdramatic loser I am and I have no idea how to change myself so that I no longer feel that way and even if I did know I wouldn’t have the mental or emotional capacity to actually do it. I want to better myself so bad but I need to be better first in order to bring myself to actually take steps to do that. I feel like the world is simply horrible and there is some sort of psychological evolutionarily conditioning that has happened to our species over time that makes a majority of us able to not only cope with that, but actually go through life believing the opposite is true, that overall the world is a good place to be. I feel like no one can claim that and be right. Any being with logic would look at our world and wonder why people aren’t begging to be taken out of their misery. It doesn’t make any sense. It’s a horrific hellscape. I genuinely believe that they created the idea of hell so that people could go through life focusing on some terrible hypothetical fate instead of being able to register that there is no need for hypothetical threats like that. Hell is where we are now. The best part about all this is that is I actually have a great life. Compared to all others, my job is simple, my parents still help me financially. And, I don’t take care of myself or maintain a social life or do anything at all with myself that would register as a blip of activity/effort in life. I literally just sit on my ass. I am still depressed despite having nothing to complain about and the fact that the world is literally on fire and people are suffering some of the most terrible things a person can suffer through and I am still here feeling bad for myself makes me sick and drives me insane and the only logical solution to all of this that I can think of is to just remove myself from the situation. No one needs me sitting around moping and I don’t need to lead a life that consists of sitting around moping and dwelling on all the reasons why being alive is so depressing. I am quite literally a waste of space but I would be more than happy to give that space up. Everything is so dark and my heart physically hurts all the time like I’m in mourning or going through some sort of visceral reaction all the time. I’m trapped",0

However, when I'm feeling normal, I don't feel any romantic attraction towards anyone. That's weird, right? Shouldn't it be the other way around, where you feel too numb to experience romantic attraction at all during an episode? How the hell does depression even work?!",0
"I’m not really sure why I think it matters, or what normal is…but I guess I want a sounding board as to how common it is to feel like I do after loss or whether I truly have depression.In March, my grandmother died. She was 103, all I could really do was salute such an achievement because my mother had gone from sharp as tack to severe dementia within 3 months. Three incredibly painful months for her and for our family. My mother died in march, i sat and held her hand while her breaths became less frequent until one was finally her last.I have a six month old baby, and had to do most of the funeral planning as my Dad has just fallen apart (they were together for 56 years) so i coasted through all that in a haze of activity and responsibility.But now, a few months later I feel like I’ve heard people describe depression, and recognise it from my youth when I had no idea what it was.I cannot really sleep, but I cannot get up. I have no interest in anything other than seeing that my Son’s needs are met. There are tears in my eyes or just behind them at all times. I cannot think straight.I think its a dumb question, but I don’t know if this is just how grief is? There is a person who was infinitely kind and always believed in me and she’s gone.

I feel as if nobody really even cares for me and with each passing day I become more and more lonely and insecure with myself. I used to be a very happy person, finding joy in a lot of things. Soon after I had graduated from high school, everything just seemed to fall apart. Little to no interest in things I used to be interested in. I don’t even have much motivation to play games I like or watch shows I enjoy. I’ve tried explaining to my parents about how I’ve been feeling lately and they just laugh and mock me and it genuinely hurts and pisses me off. Whenever I’m surrounded by people, I fake my emotions and pretend to be happy but nobody truly knows how I feel. I do nothing exciting in my life.

I want to cry myself to sleep but I can’t even form tears in my eyes and instead just stare at the wall while I lay in bed and feel completely numb.

The last time I can remember feeling truly happy was probably a freshman in high school. Ever since then, I always have a blank expression, no emotion, no motivation whatsoever. I’ve lost all of my friends due to this. I do, however, have a wonderful fiancé that I just got engaged to. I also have parents, I work out when I can, I eat relatively healthy, and overall a well adjusted life. But despite all of that, I just can’t feel happy. I’m very anti social and have a hard time holding a conversation, I just can’t find myself interested enough to be immersed in a conversation. It just feels like a chore to me.

I see photos of myself when I was little and I don't recognize myself, I see photos of myself from a while ago and I hate myself. In every photo I'm smiling when in truth I just wanted to cry.

"Since last time that I posted here, I've had some good months. It's been almost a year of therapy now. Sometimes it really puts my life into perspective but other times I feel like I fail to describe just how miserable I feel from time to time. I want to explain to my bf and other close people exactly how I feel when I start feeling hopeless. My depressive episodes have certainly reduced. Yet somedays even the tiniest incident would send me back to my spiral of negative and hopeless thoughts. I feel exhausted, I feel like skipping work. I skip any activity I can. During these times I fear if there will ever come a time when I have the strength to actually stop doing everything and lie in bed all day. It's not ideal but I feel that way a lot. I want to stop feeling stressed about dealing with my loneliness and melancholia. Because it's more difficult to live a normal life, to go to work to earn a living, to get up so that my loved ones aren't as worried. I don't want to be a burden and that makes me suffer even more. Sometimes I feel like my body likes to give up on me and all of this comes from a person with sufficient privilege. ",0

I hate feeling like a burden to my parents, I know they would hate me saying this, but I can't help but feel this way. I do help out a lot watching my sister when they are both at work.

Just some reassurance that this depressive episode will pass.Just for context, I was doing really well this last couple of weeks and making some improvements at work that my depression had prevented me from making. My bosses have been understanding. A colleague who means well has a very very harsh style of feedback that triggers what I feel is rejection sensitive disorder in me. Whilst she says she’s doing what’s best for me by being blunt with all this might not be, it just makes me feel like shit when she tries to help. I think the reason why others give me feedback in a different way is because that’s how you should give it instead of being so negative.I am doing therapy and I was trying a new antidepressant which I felt was working until that moment.All that was just for context, but I hope you can see me now why my depressive mood popped up again and triggered feelings of uselessness, worthlessness, and anxiety. It feels like this will never pass, as it always does with depression. My depression has ruined my weekend with my girlfriend and baby girl. Can I just ask for nothing more than some assurance that things will get better struggling with this, it’s hard to feel positive sometimes.",0

I'm mentally and physically tired (fibromyalgia) and I just want to go back to staying inside 24/7. Up until last year, I only left the house to go to the doctors or to the store. I started two retail jobs and I hate them, everyday I'm tired, anxious and in pain, the small amount of disability I get only covers my rent. I want to quit so badly, but I have so many other bills plus a horrible shopping addiction. I have no hobbies, friends and can't drive. If money was not an issue, I'd never leave my house. I'm so mentally tired of living. I don't want to go to work today, but I need the $60 on my check (pathetic).",0

I’ve been in bed all day staring at the ceiling or my screen. Sometimes I journal or write notes but that’s it. I can’t open my window blinds because I can’t stand sunlight. I have trouble getting outside the house. I’ve written tons of stuff in my to-do list, including building a sleep schedule, cleaning my house, getting a pet, having creative hobbies, volunteering, doing part-time gig, etc. but I have no energy to do any of them. I’ve been pushing myself to do all sorts of things all my life, and I drained all my energy in the process. Now I can’t push myself to do anything.  Even things I enjoy.I don’t want to do anything. For the first time in my life, I’m letting myself do what I want, which is nothing. For the first time in my life, I stop ignoring my emotions.But this can’t go on forever? When I do nothing, I can’t help but ruminate on my trauma and feel anxious. Right now the only things I can do are taking notes while watching Dr. K, which turns out to be super therapeutic to write stuff in paper. I started auditing a course about medical neuroscience on Coursera, because I’m interested in neuroscience and want to know what’s going on in my own brain. I just enrolled myself in another free Coursera course about developmental psychology—I loved this topic while in college, and I think taking this course would help me better help my cousin raise my nephew, so that he wouldn’t be as messed up as me when reaching his teens.I feel guilty not being a productive member in society.

"So I have hung in there for years now, working on myself and trying to building a life for my future partner. Well I'm exhausted, and it's never going to happen. No loving wife, no kids, just an empty life caring for others and working until I drop dead, to be forgotten. I didn't think I what I wanted was unreasonable, SO many of my ancestors had it. But I am invisible to women, and just getting older every year. I never cared about the money, I just wanted to love, and be loved in return. But every single partner I had threw my love in the dirt and walked away. I wanted to build a life, and it turns out, they just wanted to have fun, and keep having fun. I am so very tired. Tired of this nightmare, of all of societies lies, just everything. I yearn for the grave.I spend more and more time now either sleeping in my free time or in a fantasy world with my dream girl, where I am at least loved and cared for. I think this life was just a mis-step, perhaps the person I was supposed to be with died young, or was never born? I can't imagine a world without here, yet I've never met her, and still, feel I have, and feel her absence every single waking second. My mind reels against this reality.",0
"Did I screw myself by refusing to take an antidepressant that actually worked? It really did work, but unfortunately I allowed myself to listen to paranoid people who hate antidepressants and quit taking it because of that. I was on Cymbalta and I quit because of ""scary"" potential side effects. I mean it did work but I had one complaint, I had to take it at night because it totally knocked me out (good) but it also made me wake up every single hour throughout the night (bad) but for the first time in my life it was actually easy to wake up early and get out of bed with zero struggle (good) before that I didn't even know that it was possible to have an easy time getting out of bed. Cymbalta worked for me because it gave me a more positive attitude, but I didn't like waking up every single hour at night.The reason why I told my doctor that I didn't want to take it anymore was because I said that it stopped working, and it did, but at this point I can no longer remember what exactly I meant by that. Did the positive attitude go away? Was it hard to get out of bed again? I really don't remember. At one point I tried taking Pristiq but I didn't take it long enough to give it a chance to work. Sometimes I think I want to try Pristiq again, or maybe I should take Cymbalta again, I don't know what I should do.",0

"So, a few months ago i was in a residential living space to help with my sobriety from drinking, and ended up meeting a girl there during my last few weeks. Pretty much everything i look for in a girl. Yet, sadly i ended up getting rejected twice from her. Second time was hard since we had plans to go on a date together, just for her to call it off two days prior..We pretty much have similar interests. And even now i feel chemistry between us that I can only hope will lead to something more someday. Despite her having her heart set on an ex-boyfriend of hers currently. Its just a depressing time for me. Since we hang out a lot. It also didnt help when she got drunk one night and became flirty and playful towards me I dont know..my biggest fear is her getting back together with her ex.

"first off, i know im a bad person. i just need to tell the truth for once, so i can feel like a man.okay so, me and my ex had been dating for 2 years. we both had our flaws, we were young, and eachothers first love. she did things, i did things, but what i did was way worse. in september of 2023 i commited my greatest mistake and sin.she was a special girl, at first she stayed with me and i swore to her i wouldn't do it again. but since then, she got further and further away from me. and i don't blame her for it. we were off and on but on the night of july 25th, she told me she was with someone else. i took it very badly because i still loved her (ironic, i know.) trust me, i know that i deserved for her to do that.i do regret it very much. i apologized to her a million different times, and i would do anything to make it up to her. i would do anything to warn myself, to change the past. i was a really bad boyfriend, but it only took something as tragic to realize that i was a bad boyfriend. i wish i could tell myself to be a better man so i wouldn't lose her.i feel extremely guilty and depressed. i cry almost every day all day, even though i should not be the one crying. and i cannot take care of myself. when i look in the mirror, i see a boy who could not control himself. i lost the love of my life because i was so fucking stupid. since that night, i have been hung up on alcohol and weed. i also struggle to keep meals down and usually throw up alot. i also cut myself alot, because i feel as though someone as bad as me deserves to feel that pain.on top of it, im very jealous. i wish she was with me, and not him. but i know i shouldn't think that. i wish i didn't feel like this because i know im a bad person for doing this.what im basically asking is, how do i make it up to her? should i wait for her? she said she forgived me, and that she knows that i really would do anything to make up for her, but i feel like shes only saying that so i dont hate myself. the truth is that i do hate myself, and i can hardly look in the mirror.im not sure on how to be a better man. i know that i need to change, for her or for everybody. but im not sure how. i feel as though i will never be better than that boy in september who could not control his own body.i guess this post is open ended. if you want to comment bad things about me, that is fine. if you want to give me advice, that is fine. i need to know how to forgive myself, because i can hardly look in the mirror. i carry a great shame, and i just wish i had a time machine so i can tell myself to be better sooner. how do i make sure she knows that i would do anything to fix us? do i even have a chance of being with her again after what i did?she was my first love, and i still have very strong feelings to her. i know this is all ironic but i really just want to make it up to her one day. im struggling to move on because of my mistake. it feels like i will feel like this forever. im not sure if i could trust myself to date anyone else.thank you for reading this post if you did read all of it. i know im a bad person, but in making this, i hope i can become a better man for her.edit: i know that people like me who have done terrible things are reasons why you wonderful people are on this sub reddit. i am sorry. i just dont know what to do. i am really lost",0

"31M uni student (B.sc biology major) currently work nights 32hrs/week at a supermarket. Living with my ex and our 2 year old son. We split up after 13 years because we were/are both unhappy, neither can afford to rent on a single income, because it would be over half either of our wages just to live in a small unit.Even if we could find separate places, she wont agree to a week on week off arrangement with our son. And then even if she agreed to that, she's anti-vax and where we live vaccinations required for daycare.     I work nights and she works days, which means I am the daycare during the day until I go to work at night. This leaves very little room to study.I've nearly finished my degree, but we still live in our home town, and it has very few career paths to pursue in my field of study. The plan was to move to a bigger city and get a job, but then everything fell apart.I feel extremely trapped.    I can't date, because I'm a 31 year old single dad living with his ex.

"Do you guys wonder how different your lives would be if you were born neurotypical? I wonder all the time. It's always been a struggle, depression at 13 and a ""better late than never"" autism diagnosis at 30. 17 years of this, at least i know why i was always misunderstood. I hate the feeling of being misunderstood, I hate unfairness in general. Don't get me wrong, even as I lament the life I could've lived and mourn for the person I could be but am not, I still realize I'm only 30 and having doctors and diagnoses and meds is better than not. I just want the green light to rest.Not ""eternal slumber"" rest, just the green light to let off my shoulders the years of being misunderstood, the weight that injustices of decades past that still (see prior neurovirgency details for explanation) haunts and clings to me.I know that pain is a teacher. The child touches the hot stove once, if he's smart. I have a problem where I often cannot tell when the pain has stopped being useful to me, so I hang on to it far too long as if there's a final lesson to be learned still. Maybe the last lesson is to take that leap of faith and say ""I've ruminated over this for 3 months, screw it"" and try to convince myself that doing so will not cause the world to implode and my family (who are all extremely loving and supportive) to shun me like some ancient tribe.It's the time that I worry about with mental illness. It takes time out of every day to be mentally ill. I need a longer notice than 1 day usually for a social meeting just to psych myself up. If I have something bad happen that really hurts me emotionally, it could set me back for months. Months that the people who hurt me are out living and moving forward, while I have to remember how to trust people again.I'd like to hear your perspectives, and words of encouragement would be nice if you have them.

I ended it recently. I was honest. I don't feel like I will ever financially even be able to visit short term to meet this person. I need something physical. Also for the last few weeks I reconnected with someone I always truly loved. Its been an extreme conflict in my mind. I thought if I ended the long distance relationship I could rekindle this one.

But it's always right after I become sleep deprived or depressed or anxious these big things I need to address and deal with occur.

It never seems to happen when I'm in a good condition overall and in a position to handle such challenges.It's just really frustrating and then adds on top of the already difficult condition I'm dealing with. So it's like why? Why the fuck can't these things happen when I'm equipped to handle them, to address them, to approach them in a good and positive way.

"I've been struggling with depression for quite some time now. I'm a man, aged 32. It was especially bad in coronavirus times, when I lost my job and girlfriend. But I somehow got through it, because I had a lot of other things on my mind. But right now, I have a cushy office job. From the outside you'd think everything was ok in my life. I got an ok job, an ok apartment, 2 cars... But it's just the face I put on. I leave the house and I'm in ""automatic"" mode. I do what's required of me and when I'm back home - I unwind. Usually with a glass of whiskey in my hand.Anyway... Today I felt particularly full of negativity. I didn't want to talk to anybody today. I didn't want to see anything outside my house. Even when I talked to my parents... in the back of my mind was a feeling of ""When is this talk going to be over"", but I continued talking with them as if nothing was wrong. Now, I love my parents and I like talking to them.  After we finished talking, I felt intense hatred and anger in me. Really intense, almost like never before. I smashed my fists together as hard as I could, got up and punched the wall until I noticed blood on my right hand. I washed my hands and cleaned the wall and then I cried for about 2 minutes. Not from the pain of hitting the wall, but a sense of being overwhelmed by it all. I don't know.Anyway... this happened about half an hour ago and the feeling of intense anger is gone. I don't feel as sad. I feel neutral and a lot more social. I also served in the military if that matters... Guess I was taught to get a grip and carry on and maybe that helps.  The problem is still there. But it's not as severe at the moment. It's like my little episode was like a relief valve on a high pressure system.I tried getting help twice. First time the lady doctor didn't even hear me out and went on about the typical bullshit, how I wasn't hugged enough as a kid and that's why I was having issues. No! I had a good childhood and my parents were and continue to be supportive and love me.   So I tried a second time. Got an appointment for a psychiatrist. Guy listened to me go on for 20 minutes about my problems and then said I was fine and that's it. I wasn't prescribed any meds, I didn't get any more appointments for therapy. It's like the doctor didn't want to deal with me.  I never tried reaching out for help again. Still soldiering on. Still functioning as an adult. Still trying to fix my mental health.

He also doesn’t really know what exactly being depressed entails and how serious of a disease it really is.

I didn't have money to get food today so I just walked out of the store after putting the food, it was humiliating. I just want pass out and never wake up again, my dreams are better than this and they just remind of all the fucked up shit in my life. No fucking wonder my mother left when I turned 18. I'm a piece of shit.",0
"i was with a girl we were dating from 1.5 years. i used to love her so much she was literally everything to me everything was fine we took a year extra for our competitive exam and both were studying (we always had a plan after our exams we will be together again just like we were earlier) and we didn't have texted from past 20-25 days yesterday i texted her and she just said leave me I don't want you ever again, please leave me she was my motivation to everything and now what she said has completely destroyed me mentally I don't know what to do now ",0
"I started vaping since I was 14, im addicted now I tried to quit like a million times once I stopped vaping for 3 months but I still crave it when im sad or depressed so I started to vape again I hate it so much and I  also have asthma which make it worse I can’t breathe well or work out and I hate my life for it I want to quit now but I know I’ll end up baying a new one, and always when I ask people that used to vape how did they quit they say they just stopped it doesn’t make sense to me, why can they stop and i cant",0
"Is this a depression? My husband has a depression entirely all his life. Sometimes worse sometimes better.We have been married 18 years plus.I think myself as a happy go person basically.But, recently, I sometimes want to shut down myself from him  which I never thought before.I don’t want to share with him what I think or what I did that day. Seems like I don’t want to make an effort to do that… He did that to me many times and now it hurts me. But, why now?? Am I just following him?? ",0
"Hey,Sorry,dass ich euch hier zutexte,aber ich muss mir das mal von der Seele schreiben,um einigermaßen (hoffentlich) mal wieder ein Auge zuzubekommen.Manchmal frage ich mich,sitzen da oben irgendwelche geisteskranken zusammen und denken sich sowas aus? Mein Leben ist wie ein Horrorfilm. Mit 11 Jahren hatte ich eine beste Freundin, Sabrina. Wir waren immer irgendwie zusammen,selbst nach ihrer OP war ich bei ihr. Ja,dann war sie tot. Mit 9!! Das begleitet mich bis heute. Meine Mum ist ein Mensch,der mich noch nie in den Arm genommen hat,geschweige denn gesagt hat,dass sie mich liebt. Wenn ich mal als Kind krank war,war sie mir böse. Und das zeigte sie immer,indem sie mich ignorierte.Einmal 7 Monate am Stück kein Wort mit mir geredet. Nicht beachtet. Eiskalt. Und auf Nachfrage nur gesagt: Ist Nix. Dann wieder Schweigen. Meine Mum hatte eine beste Freundin, die an Krebs verstarb. Sie hinterließ eine Tochter, die 7 Jahre jünger als ich ist und bat meine Mutter,sich um die Tochter zu kümmern. Dieses Mädchen wurde praktisch von meiner Mum adoptiert und siehe da,meine Mutter kann lieben! Nur halt nicht mich. Immerhin bin ich mit 21 Jahren mit meinem ersten Freund zusammengekommen. Die Liebe meines Lebens. Ich zog mit ihm zusammen und wurde Grundschullehrerin,ein langes Studium und hartes Ref. Mit Mobbing. Aber egal,es war geschafft. Wir hatten Höhen und Tiefen aber er war mein bester Freund, meine Familie. Ich war mit ihm zusammen aufgewachsen,kannte ihn praktisch mein Leben lang. Wollten heiraten. Dann starb ganz plötzlich mein Dad. Allein. In seiner Wohnung,in die er gezogen war,nachdem sich meine Eltern getrennt hatten. Anstatt dass die Familie zusammenrückt, machte mich meine Tante (Dads Schwester) für seinen Tod verantwortlich und prügelte mich. Sie nahm Oma zu sich und verweigerte mir den Kontakt zu ihr, aus Rache oder so.Ich wollte nichts Böses,nur meine Oma sehen, die auch schon nach mir fragte und mich vermisste. Eines Tages,als ich Blumen zu Dads Grab brachte,entdeckte ich das Grab meiner Oma. Richtig krank. Meine Tante hatte es niemandem gesagt,dass sie gestorben ist. Ich konnte nicht mal zur Beerdigung.Es geht weiter.Gerade in dem Moment,als ich dachte,ich will jetzt meine eigene Familie gründen, kam es. Ich dachte,ich brech weg. Mein Verlobter machte Schluss. Nach 12 Jahren.Wegen einer anderen Frau.Ich dachte,ich überlebe das hier nicht,wog 42 Kilo. Totaler Tiefpunkt meines Lebens. Alles,aber wirklich alles weg.Bis auf eines: Die Tanzschule.Ging dort dann wieder regelmäßiger hin, musste ja irgendwie wieder bei Null anfangen und war dort eigentlich schon seit 2017 Mitglied. Ich lernte dort jemanden kennen und verliebte mich. Hätte nie gedacht,dass ich das nochmal könnte.  Ein Jahr lang hielt er mich hin. Spielte heiß/kalt. Sagte, er brauche noch Zeit aber will unbedingt eine Beziehung mit mir.Ich erwischte ihn beim Sex mit einer anderen. Ich brach den Kontakt ab und was ist passiert? Genau, er ist jetzt mit einer anderen aus der Tanzschule zusammen. Plötzlich ist seine Bindungsangst weg! Ich kann euch nicht sagen,wie sehr mir das wehtut, so dermaßen fertig bin ich.Ich werde also gehen müssen,denn angucken kann und will ich mir das nicht.Meine beste Freundin hat mich heute für ihn und seine Neue versetzt,spielt also jetzt in seinem Team. Ichbin seit 7 verfickten Jahren Mitglied in dieser Tanzschule und werde mich abmelden müssen und wieder da anfangen,wo ich mich bestens auskenne: bei Null und im tiefsten Loch.Achso und zum Thema neuen Mann kennenlernen und Familie gründen. Ich bin 35 und ein Test beim Gyn hat gezeigt (welch Wunder) dass ich nicht schwanger werden kann.Mein gesamtes Leben ist geprägt von unerwiderter Liebe, plötzlichem Verlassenwerden und Verlusten.Ich war immer das Aschenputtel, mehr nicht. Ich hasse mein Leben,trotz Therapie und Antidepressiva komme ich mit dem Verarbeiten nicht nach.Ich hasse mein Leben.Danke fürs Zuhören",0

(29M) after almost 20 years of therapy ive finally come to the conclusion that I'm just not built for this world. Theres no place that wants me or that I feel welcome in. All I do work and sleep for 6 days a week. I've lost all my friends and family due to my work schedule. I thought that after enough time something would change in my life to give me a reason to keep living. Sadly thats just not the case. The day I turn 30 will be my last day alive and honestly its been a very long time coming.,0
"To be honest im not sure why im even curious, but whatever.Last summer in 2023, i had a really bad slump where i wouldnt get out of bed, not eat for days, cry myself to sleep every night, constantly have a sinking feeling in my chest, never have energy for anything, etcAnd the thing im curious about is, that at that time, i didnt wanna live, or like... exist, i guess, im not sure how to describe it. I didnt wanna kill myself, but i completely lost my energy to live and i just wanted to not exist, never having to worry about anything anymoreDoes that count as ""suicidal""?

This hasn't changed my desire though, at least to the extent where I want to change my mind.I've decided, that I'm going to persevere through August, and September, then afterwards decide if I'm going to go through with it or not.I'm choosing this as my time limit because I've got a lot of things to look forward to. I'm staying at a close relatives place for August, my birthdays in September, I'm going to go to a concert with my friends, something I've been looking forward to for a while is releasing, and school will start again.

"(16F) This year I am attending the afternoon shift at school, and my classmates chose to switch to the midday shift. The people who made me laugh are no longer there, and school has become boring. I no longer have any motivation to continue wanting to be competitive with my classmates; now I've lost the only thing I had, being the girl with good grades. I know that if I put effort into taking the exams, I will pass them as easily as I always did, but I simply don't put any effort into solving them or participating in class.Also, the dysphoria regarding my voice is worse.I am going through another depressive episode, but I cannot drop my commitments due to being depressed. Even so, my biggest commitment—appearing to be a happy girl—I am unable to fulfill. I am doing everything to be the girl my boyfriend and friends want me to be and to fight the depression by staying active, but I am exhausted. I want to rest from eating every day.

Yep. So fucking tired of going through life.,0
"I, 29F, dont feel like i exist on this dimension anymore. My body is on autopilot, going through the motions and i am just here. I wouldnt say i see myself in third person but i feel the separation between my body and conciousness. I have surpassed the point of sadness that I am just here. Of course i get the occassional ""i dont want to be here anymore""  but i am just so numb. And it kills me because I have a toddler. Her whole life has been tainted by my depression and i cannot remember all of the moments i will never be able to recreate. I dont want to feel this way anymore.

"I've been best friends with a girl for a while now. We met as my last relationship came to an end, and while she was dealing with an on and off toxic relationship. We got close very quickly, spending much of our time together, and becoming the person each other could depend on and go to for anything. But I caught feelings because to me she was just everything that I wanted in a partner. She didn't like me in that way, and on top of that she's still dealing with the ex and other guys. I know she loves me, she's shown she does many times, just not romantically. And it didn't help that I had all these people surrounding us telling me 'oh she'll like you eventually, she's just traumatized from all her past relationships and still in love with her ex.' But now, she basically told me she has no interest in me like that whatsoever and that my feelings are making it hard to be friends with me because it makes her feel guilty every time she's with me that she's hurting someone she cares deeply for. I don't want to give up our friendship, I absolutely adore the girl and want her in my life no matter what, but I can't lie and act like I'm not spiraling downward over the idea that I feel like I wasn't good enough.

"TLDR: I need advice on how to tell someone that I want to die, that I feel empty and life is a haze with each day slipping into the next ad nauseum ad mortem. You don't need to read the rest, it's just why I struggle with figuring it out on my ownI have been sitting here, looking at the post screen, my half removed tooth still keeps agonisingly thumping on and on and on, and you know what? I think I like that, I think I feel alive because of that, my head hurts and I feel disorientated from it, but I feel alive. One could argue that this is some weird representation of myself, I am suffering in my head and I won't tell anyone I know, because I fear help. As I write this it is no surprise to me, I have basically convinced myself that suffering is making me alive, I want to die so dearly, to just stop being, the lack of any embrace, if I drank I'd say it was intoxicating like beer or whatever. I just want to spend my life in bed without anyone knowing I was there, I can't sleep because I never felt awake in the first place, I'm going through life like a haze, yer again reminding me of how hard it is to think straight with the rotting nerve endings of my tooth screaming at my like my own thoughts do. Much like the tooth I don't know how much longer I may endure it, I fear I may yank it out instead of talking it out. I have tried to endure for years, I don't know when it began because it felt like it was always there; I never knew a day without it. I am terrified of getting help, I tried therapy before, I basically lied through my unbrushed teeth because I was younger then, my mother was in the room with the therapist so I did not dare say what I truly thought. I remember distinctly when she saw my self harm scars, she threatened to show my younger siblings and my father, shaming me for it. I have contacted suicide and crisis hotlines before, each time they explained how to help, each time I didn't do what they said because it always would end up with someone else finding out, which scared me to no end. Well now I wish to change that, I want to find a way to get help. ",0
I just want to die and want this to be over like who the fuck is this guy setting next to me who are these people I feel like they are just strangers next to me I wish if I can just disappear I wish If I just stop existing this guy so called my boyfriend I was crying right next to him and he didn’t pay any fucking attention like his friend asked me if I was fine and he didn’t even notice and he didn’t check on me .. last day I almost killed myself and he knows that he knows how shitty my situation is right now but he is oblivious ffs .. I am seriously thinking about doing it rn Its not because of him it is because of my whole life that it never seems to get better no matter what I do .. at this point I gave up I am done,0
So idk why i am at this place but fate put me in a position where i am left feeling bad because my friend's girlfriend did all the bullshit and im the one paying for it by losing my relationship. My girlfriend did nothing wrobg because my friend's gf was the one who started a rukus and screamed at somebody my girlfriend considers as family. What do people expect in return? A soft reply? No.There are more details to that but i feel like i lost my relationship for nothing. I am suffering for somebody else's drama. I feel like killing myself but i also know that its a cowardly act. I just dont know what to do! My brain is articulating so many things and making me think of extremely negative thoughts. Please help.,0

Okay so long story short my husband has been depressed. He has dealt with depression his whole life but it’s gotten really bad recently. For context we recently moved to Alabama from Utah. His family lives in California. We are currently staying with my parents while our house is being built. We have one more month until it is done. He gets along super well with my family. He works as an accountant and does super well at his job and is up for promotion next year when someone is retiring. We play video games together and it’s our number one hobby. He said nothing outside of personal relationships are making him happy. He comes home from work and nothing he does makes him happy. I try to get him to play games or watch movies and try to help anyway I can to suggest things we can do outside the house too but he is a natural homebody anyways so doesn’t want to go out. He said he feels like he’s not doing enough not making enough money not taking care of himself ect… he just makes these lists of things that he feels he needs to do better. I try to listen and tell him that no one else thinks this and he is putting this pressure on himself. He really is amazing and I’m trying to help him see that. He keeps insisting that he isn’t putting pressure on himself and he is just depressed. Normally when he gets in a funk the next day after some food and sleep he feels better. But this has been going on for weeks. I try to keep reassuring him he is doing enough and I truly love him and think he is the best man. I’m just not sure what to do or what can help. Any advice is welcomed and appreciated ,0

"I have been feeling very depressed. I feel a lot of guilt, fatigue and overall very blank. I don't feel like I want to do anything.For context, I stay in a hostel, thousands of kilometres from home. I was diagnosed with severe depression 2.5 yrs back. Since then it has been a downhill. I get physical symptoms too, GERD and random fevers and body aches. I have tried medications for very close to 2 yrs. I was into therapy for close to 1.5 yrs. The thing which bothers me is the guilt. I get guilty in telling my parents that I'm not well. I get guilty in talking to professionals despite knowing this is literally their job. This is the reason why I left therapy too. I feel guilty in telling anybody here in hostel that I won't be able to help them in doing a particular task or going to college on certain days. I feel guilty just for existing. I even feel like I would be better off dead because everything I do brings with it a daunting amount of guilt. I hate it but it has been stuck to me with a permanent glue I guess. Whom do I talk to?

"I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for most of my life (25 m) and I don’t know how being happy or satisfied for any real length of time feels. Atp depression and anxiety is just the norm. I feel so behind because of this I can barely keep a good job for any decent period of time because these feelings just slow me down so much. Most days I don’t feel like living I just want to end this nightmare. It doesn’t help that the world just fucking sucks and I always feel inadequate in every area of my life. My friends and family out pace me in everything, everyone else is making something of their lives and I’m just… nowhere. My girlfriend is getting promoted to manager of the same job I got fired from due to my inadequacies, meanwhile I’m working @ Dollar General making a measly $11 an hour. I can’t fucking keep up because I just fucking hate myself so much. I have these fears that some day soon she’s gonna realize I’m a useless fucking idiot who’s never gonna get off of his knees and stand up to make something of himself. She’s so motivated and positive and I’m just a sad sack of shit. I’m kind of just a golden retriever boyfriend at this point and that’s fine but it’s not how I want to be seen. I’ve been making efforts with therapy and I’m now on the path to trying to get medicated but I’m afraid that my depression is so deeply a part of my being that I can never turn my life around or know what to do w/o it. I wish I was someone else so bad, at one point in time I thought I might be okay with who I am but I had the inevitable realization that I just dont fucking like myself. I hope I can hold on for a bit longer to see the fruits of my efforts in the fight against my mental illness, but I just don’t know how much longer I can hold out. ",0

" I think I have never been truly happy because of my parents, they have never treated me well (the only memories I have with them is when mom called me an animal because my brother got hurt &amp; dad tells me every time how dumb I am and that “I should respect my brother” but respect what exactly? That child has everything he wants. Everything. Even things he doesn’t use, he just buys stuff cuz he wants to. He’s a spoiled brat who can’t take the word “no”. I just can’t understand why they don’t love me the same way, I know the reason but I think it’s stupid &amp; I still can’t believe it. My first memory with my dad is when I was around 8, he was showing me some photos with my mum being pregnant with me and then he said “we wanted a boy, but here we are now” my world crushed in that moment and it crushed even more when my brother was born. I tried everything I could, being a top student, being respectful, pleasing them but nothing. That little pice of shit is still their favourite. I had lots of mental breakdowns and they know it but they just brush it of by saying that I’m just a spoiled brat who wants attention, it breaks my heart cuz they never view my point and they never listen…  I want to talk with my mum about therapy again (when I was in the hospital some doctors recomanded it cuz they noticed depression signs) but I know she won’t listen, she never does, she didn’t listen when I told her that my cousin SA d me, I feel like she doesn’t care. Everytime when I try to talk with her she starts acting like the victim saying that “she can’t stand being in the house with me and my drama and that she will most likely get into a mental hospital because of me”. I think if I kms she will finally see that I didn’t want attention, I wanted help.",0

"Hi, I'm a female(18) who lives with her parent in India. For context :[https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/8NndBDukXw](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/8NndBDukXw)[https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/vLYpfuAy5I](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/s/vLYpfuAy5I)I'm sorry, but you won't be able to understand much of this post without the context. So this happened two days ago/a day after my last post.I woke up at 11 am and my parents were talking about how my aunt had called my mom in the morning asking about my bank account details( implying that she'd help finance my career).  I thought it was weird how last night my aunt/uncles/cousins had seriously stated how much this offer should not be known by my parents so that they don't influence my decision and today my aunt just offered it to my mom. My parents were initially against the Idea and didn't wanna accept help but then I tried to convince them how it would actually be beneficial for me for now and they could just pay my relatives back when they received their money. They agreed after a long conversation. My mom then called my aunt to accept the offer but only for one semester so that they could pay my relatives as soon as they could and my aunt was okay with that. I got a group call from my cousins at night and they asked why I couldn't do the only thing that they had asked of me which was to not tell my parents about the offer. I told them that I only discussed this topic with my parents because my aunt had already told my mom about it. My cousins then asked my aunt while still on call and she fully denied ever mentioning financial support to my mom. My cousins then just lectured me the entire call about how I lied to the people who were willing to help my career. I kept denying it but I don't think they believed me. I cried and then pretended like nothing happened to my parents as I don't think they would've appreciated me telling my parents about anything related to the offer.Apparently, after the call about my mom accepting the offer by my relatives with my aunt, my aunt told my cousins and uncles that I had told them everything about the conversation that they had with me, which is why my cousins had called me at night.  I then woke up the next morning to my mom showing me a message that my aunt sent to her just now. It said that I should pursue a completely different career path as it could pay more( implying that they revoked the financial support offer). I opened my phone and she wrote the same thing to me. I just went to the bathroom and had a breakdown like always and came back.  I texted my cousin about it in the calmest way and he just said that my aunt/uncles/cousins just aren't sure they can help anymore as there is a risk that something like this could happen in the future as well and my relatives also have limited finances with their own families. I said that I could never give them the guarantee that something like this won't happen in the future as I don't control the finances, my parents do, and can only make sure to remind them. I also asked if they still thought that I had lied and he said that He didn't. I said it was okay and I'm tired of talking about my career for today at the end.  I just have one question, shouldn't my cousins/aunts/relatives at least be sure that they can or cannot finance me before offering me this serious opportunity? I was ready to lie to my parents for the sake of my career for these two days but still got accused of lying and had that opportunity revoked.  I feel like it was a prank at the most wrong time lol. I haven't picked up any of the calls from my friends in that college because I don't have a good update nor am i gonna be able to talk to normal when my life is declining. They must think that I've become an asshole now.   I had such a big headache that day from all the crying that I had to take a paracetamol and I just didn't wanna talk about my future for the day. At night, my mom started to talk to my aunt initially for work-related purposes which shifted to them talking about how it's annoying that I won't tell them about my conversations with my aunt/cousins/uncles. I couldn't keep it in anymore so I walked out crying to the bathroom. My mom kept talking to my aunt even after I ran. I came back after an hour and they kept pressing me about the conversations that I had to confess and my parents felt sorry for me.It's already SO hard receiving messages from all the club/college messages where My friends discuss what they're gonna do tomorrow. Posts of everyone enjoying college on social media. I wanna break my phone. It feels like everyone is moving forward and everything in my life is moving back except my age. I'll turn 19 this year.  Rewatching old shows is the only way of detaching myself from reality so I won't cry every second. It gets even worse lol because my mom keeps talking about my relatives in a bad way but I just don't wanna hear their names anymore, sorry. So now my mom thinks I'm rude, my friends think I'm an asshole and my relatives think I'm a liar.  Life feels like a tragic tale that no one will remember. That's why I'm writing this. Maybe one day someone will discover my phone and look at this (delulu). I think it deserves a cry :)Is there Anything I can do?",0
It’s just a cycle round and round. I have failed again ,0
"My life fucking sucks, and it has for the past two years now. During the final week of 2021, I left an emotionally abusive relationship and ended up with Covid. During that time, I developed painful open diabetic ulcers atop both of my feet, which took 10 months to clear. November 2022, I moved out of a volatile household situation (alcoholic roommate), and moved in with a nearby co-worker/friend. Two weeks later, I was rushed to the ER and had to have emergency surgery due to a kidney &amp; bladder infection. Between 12/2022 and 7/2023, this resulted in 10 additional hospitalizations - during which, I had 5 additional surgeries. I lost my job July 2023, after 16+ years of loyal service. The kidney/bladder infections cleared, though I am left with a catheter sticking through my gut.I had to fight for Unemployment, which went to a hearing that I ultimately won. My landlord decided not to renew my lease so they could sell the house. In October 2023, I was forced to move in with my emotionally abusive mother, which is where I have been stuck since. I've put countless time &amp; energy into searching for work, but can't seem to land a single interview despite being told I have an incredible resume. I am stuck, and nothing I do brings me any closer toward improving my life. I've had to go on Medicaid, EBT and general assistance (through my township) - and I HATE it! I'm used to being there for others, helping them and making their lives easier - now I'm in a position where I can't do a damn thing, and I'm just being shit on by everyone around me.I'm not suicidal, and I cannot deny the presence of the loved ones who are in my life. All I need is a job and my life can start improving again, but the rejection of people thinking I'm not good enough is disturbing.",0
"As the title says, I feel like I’m just whining anytime it comes to the topic of depression. Like, I feel shitty, all the time, and I feel like my mood is constantly jumping from one to the next. I have no goals, I hate work, I hate school, I have no close friends, and I just feel completely isolated all the time and feel like there’s no reason, or motivation, to ever do anything. I’m terrified of reaching out for help— I feel like I’m just not bad enough to warrant it, esp when I look at these threads and see all the extremes. It feels like I’m faking for attention, when I genuinely just hate myself and everything I do, and I feel shitty about it all day almost every day. I don’t know what else to say, or do, I just can’t stand myself and I need to vent.",0
"I’m almost 30 years old and have been severely depressed my entire 20s, and regular depressed all my life before thatI’m starting to become suicidal as I can’t take this anymoreI’m not sure what to do.

"I don’t even know why i‘m writing this because there will probably just be mean people in the comments, but I really don’t wanna continue my life. I wanna end it. The only reason why i‘m still here is because I don’t wanna hurt people (family, friends). They are not many but i still don’t wanna hurt them. But isn’t that unfair? I don’t wanna keep living for them, I wanna die for myself. It’s my own life, I don’t wanna keep going. So why should I stay? They will get over it but I won’t, my life just started, there are so many more years to come. And I don’t want it to get better, I want it to end. I finally want peace. I deserve it so much… just peace, no pain anymore. No stress. No lies. No more trying. Just the end. Yeah, idk. I’ll probably regret posting that. Can y’all just shut up if you don’t have anything nice to say? Probably not lmao but worth a try. ",0
"My partner has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and she is suicidal. I tried to get her to do therapy and medication, but after a few months she stopped the medication because she thinks they are not good for her body. She’s still doing therapy though but she has been telling me they don’t really work for her. I’m feeling hopeless and helpless because she’s not doing well every day and I don’t think think I can handle her problems any longer (both because I have no idea how to help her or talk to her and because I’m getting real tired and exhausted). If she still refuses medication and therapy, what else could I realistically do to help her? Please, any advice would be greatly appreciated.",0
Currently been jobless for about 4-5 months I’m a 24+ year old with anxiety haven’t been looking for a job recently went through a traumatic event not sure what to do I lost all my motivation to work I just do door dash (sometimes) sleep and eat all day.

"So on January I have opened a business, and I have decided to partner with my best friend as we complete each other in terms of business. We were driving a motorcycle, and we crashed. This night, I was traumatized as he almost lost his life,his  teeth has fell off, nose is severed, lips is splitted, and skull fractures. I have resumed the business on my own, and I fixed the bike as we shared it. Few months later he is better, and he started going to the gym and hangong out with his friends, and I am handling the business trying to make it reach the takeoff stage. But I failed doing it on my own. So I told him, now you’re better, you should be in charge because there is so much that I don’t understand, he said I willing to close it. So we agreed to close it. I am now working on a 9-5 job that I don’t really like, just so I can cover my expenses, and I remember all of those months I have spent on my own waking up everyday to be there for the business. Sacrificing my social life so I can take it somewhere else. All the money I have lost, and All what I saw in terms of stress and anxiety. It turned into depression. I don’t know from where to start and where to end it. But I lost money, business, friends, and a relationship as I broke up with my GF when the accident happened as my life turned chaotic in one night. I am still collecting the pieces, and I hope for an upcoming trend. But I feel nothing but confusion and a void. I don’t know why I am ranting here, but maybe someone has an intresting pov and perspective, that might aid. ",0
"I'm gonna be brutally honest here, so please don't be mean. Everyday is the same for me, I wake up and I listen to music while having my morning smoke session of meth (which doesn't even help anymore but I'm afraid of the withdrawal because it has fentanyl in it) and then I proceed to listen to music all day long as some kind of form of escapism. I've been doing this whole music escapism thing for a very long time, it feels like I'll never do anything else. And I'm extremely socially isolated, I've pretty much given up on finding friends as an adult and those I did know either never lasted very long or they left me in the end and never came back. And my mind feels SO empty, well except for the ruminating thoughts that my life is over for some reason which enables me to write this. But any other thoughts? It doesn't even happen because I feel so hopeless. My mind actually becomes so blank that I have trouble with conversations for the most part. And I don't feel like I feel anything either. I do have schizophrenia along with depression, and I wonder how much that plays a part. My therapist isn't even helpful, so I'm not sure how far I'll get figuring any of this out. And neither have the therapists before him been helpful. I feel so stuck, I hate this. And apparently I'm not allowed to take SSRIs because of my schizophrenia! So, I guess I'm screwed in a sense. I don't know. ",0

"it’s not that no one loves me or wants me but everyone around me doesn’t take me seriously.  i’m a 17 year old who has autism and i am actually just comedic relief for everyone, my entire life. i feel like i’m a failing actor and every time i mess up my lines and don’t behave ""normally"" everyone just looks at me in disgust. i feel like i’m wearing a skin suit of a human]. if i express any sort of sad emotion no one takes me seriously. i feel like a self aware dog in my house. i’m constantly babied and not taken seriously and my symptoms are getting so much worse that even the one time in my life i mentioned of s*icide to my mom she told me to stop being dramatic. maybe when my frontal lobe is done i’ll be able to handle it but no one in my house or in my life really knows how i truly have felt about living. i stopped expressing it because it was met with laughter even as a child. hey yk they always say it gets better, i do believe that but no one ever tells me how to be patient until then. please help i want to have a future but my present is already so painful",0
i tried to be okay &amp; actually was for the past day &amp; earlier today.i  hosted a stream with a few online friends mostly because i didn’t want to be alone and someone there i know is in a similar situation as me (the hard road pursuing the one that you love) &amp; i wanted to try lighten the sadness and possibly distract but now its over i’m back feeling hopeless and extremely sad🥺like i was the day before yesterday. The thing i did the past day is not helping its actually kinda of making it worst (watching reels) some of the reels had love related things and yea..trigging and making me think things i don’t but also things i wish 🫠i might force myself on a game or to sleep a little later i don’t know i’m trying to keep a positive mindset but my wants is overpowering..i really hope it stops or things turn out my way…thats it for my venting + rant thanks for reading,0
Back then I wanted to ask for help when my mental health goes downhill bcs they support mental health matters but now? I just don't want to tell anyone or even show that I'm not ok because someone told me in the past that they've got so drained with someone who have depression and anxiety around them.Like I get it they have problems of their own so why would I even bother the people I love if they'll feel like I'm just another burden for them.The sad part is if they need someone to talk I'm always on ears and I do my best to make time for them bcs I don't want anyone to feel the same way I feel when I need someone and I can't even ask them for company.I don't want to bother anyone anymore and the last thing I ever want is for them to be exhausted thinking of me because I'm struggling to keep myself away from dying.,0
My parents still believe in me but I don’t think they know how bad it is for me. They still invite me to things and try to motivate and encourage me to go outside but I can see the toll it’s taken especially on my mom. When I’m away at college she has to deal with me complaining about my roommates and being miserable 24/7 and then when I come back to live with her she has to deal with my irritable lazy ass nonstop. We just talked and I literally started crying when she brought up the topic of me getting a job. It also doesn’t help that I’m 23 and this is the age when I should be looking to live on my own and becoming more independent from my parents. Instead they’re my only friends and they have to deal with a daughter who has no motivation or aspiration to even get out of bed in the morning ,0
"I feel like I'm slowly start to be tired of myself again, and with school coming soon it's probably going to be worse. I hate living not just because I get to be alone but I just feel like burden. I'm 16 and never found love yet, feel disconnected from my friends and parents, and just sits on my ass all day. I do take walks, workout,do chores for a dopamine boost but I'm afraid it ain't gonna cut it like it usually does. I had gone through depression before. Feel worthless and a disgusting corpse that is a waste of everyone's time to talk to. I've gone to. Mental hospital beforehand but I don't wanna go again because of the bill alone. And I don't wanna burden someone with my emotions. It feels selfish overall, I don't want to commit but everyday feels like drag. And I have to put on a mask every time. Any advice?",0
"I'm just tired. I can make giant strides in improving, I can go almost a week without making my thighs look like an aspen tree, and then shit (usually relating to extremely close friends nearly killing themselves) fucks me up and throws me back down at rock bottom. The more this happens, the more I just want to give up, because it always ends the same way, and destroys me over and over and over and over and over and fucking over again. Just numb at this point, and genuinely scared as to who'll get fucked up next. I'd be dead if not for my friends, but two of my closest are also two of the most suicidal friends I have. One of them nearly killed themselves just yesterday, which is the most recent back-to-the-bottom part of the cycle.I can't fucking do this shit, man. Just can't. Nothing in my life is in my control anymore and I just give up trying to reign it in--every time I do, life always reminds me that I can't get out of this fucking hell-hole, no matter how hard I try.Not helped that I'm a trans, neurodivergent, and depressed lad in Utah. I think I'm overdue for my death via suicide by a long-shot. Hell, I nearly convinced myself to kick the bucket last night, and I've been generally numb since then (not helped by the fact I doubtless scarred myself last night too, lost at least 3x more blood from s/h that day than I had in a literal month or two. I don't cut deep enough to make those leaf-shaped scars--I wish I did, though, honestly--so don't worry about me in that regard. Preferrably don't worry about me whatsoever).I ain't worried I'll kill myself soon, I want to see autumn, but I also don't want to put more weight on my friends' already crushed shoulders, so I don't *think* I'll die soon (unless one of them dies). Don't worry about me in that regard, either.Apologies to the mods if this is a Certified Bad Post, I can edit a few things if ye need me to.",0
"thought I was over the phase… just like counting the years of sobriety, had this mechanism where I count the years of timeline that I was away from seeing a therapist, dropping deep into the rabbit hole of depression or even cutting. this week haven’t been my best. some comments at work made me wonder the workability or how long I’ll have the job, not that it actually matters but yeah. Then comes family issues, which has driven me to the edge. With that took the decision to spend time at a family friend’s place, which is like my safe space. Had good time until I messed up somehow. Tbh I don’t know where I messed up, and it had driven my thoughts to think to the worst case scenario. I’m afraid of burning bridges… these fam they are the main reason that kept me grounded and away from any collapse. And now I fucked up… Open up to a close friend, I feel like my existence is just burdening everyone. I would rather be there and support them than me burdening them. Took some slices of salami to distract myself… I just wish I could end this all. ",0
"So im 25, live with my mother currently, have basically no friends that i talk with daily, the friends i do have i have not talked to in years. I have no job, even though i finished university 6 months ago and got a degree in marketing. I cant find a job for whatever reason no matter how hard i try. I got no girlfriend either, and i have the biggest anxiety for everything, but i have not been to a doctor to get anxiety meds prescribed. I go to the gym 3-4 times a week and have been for alot of years, which has been the only thing keeping my mental health together for so long. Im getting preasured by my family to find a job, but i just simply cant get one no matter how many applications i fill out. Everything together is really tearing on my mental health right now, and being halfways to 50 with basically no accomplishments is really scaring me.

So this girl commented to my post where I was asking for advice about self harm and she told me she wont help anyone to hurt themselves and that felt really nice. So I teksted her... later i found out she was over ten years older than me and it crushed me... cus I thought i finally found the one I could be with. She was perfect but she is to old. So I just said sorry and tried to leave cus i dint want to make her to look like a pedo ( im underage ) even though she didn't do anything wrong she might have felt so. when I was saying sorry she was asking why I'm saying that and I just kept saying sorry and eventually she let me leave the conversation. i feel bad and I feel like I have done wrong.i won't tell her name/account cus I respect her privacy ,0

"I recently got broken up with, proving a belief that people can only stand so much of me before they grow tired and disillusioned. A “friend” who we mutually live with decided the other day to post on social media about her annoyance that she cannot play an instrument at the house (because I’m using the room they usually are in). It sent me spiraling as I already feel so much grief and stress over the situation, and I was sobbing in the driveway for over an hour because I feel so alone and unwanted.I’ve been mostly asleep since then and not in the mood to see anybody in this house when I’m awake, but I just saw she blocked me on social media.I just feel like I’ll never be able to retain friends or partners…and the idea makes me want to commit.

I am so tired. My body feels heavy and I have no motivation to go out. I just want to stay in bed all day even when it’s nice and sunny outside. I am not suicidal or feel hopeless.

I am an introvert though but I can’t even muster the energy to go to the gym and exercise like I used to.  Is there something wrong with me?,0

"I'm going to be 25 tomorrow, and right now I can't find any meaning in my life. Nor do I see any future ahead of me.I'm gay, but I've never been in a relationship. Nobody knows “officially”, except my parents, who pressure and manipulate me to hide the situation.I went bald when I was 21/22 and it completely destroyed my self-esteem. I'm afraid to expose myself socially. It makes me nervous to go out in the street. When I look in the mirror, I explode with anger and sadness and start crying.In general, I'm small, short, pale and unattractive. I had a failed hair transplant, which makes me look rather odd. When I see boys my age, on the street, social networks, etc., so much more attractive than me, with such “normal” looks and hair, it makes me so sad that I'm not like that... I feel like I'll never find anyone. And even if I do, I live in a very homophobic environment, and all my (very few) friends are also homophobic.I feel so sad and alone. And I don't see how my life can change in the future. I'll never have a family or children. I deeply hate my job,  which takes up all my time and all my life. I hate all the moments that have passed from my life. I feel like I've completely wasted it, to little fault of mine.Nothing gives me pleasure. No hobbies, nothing. I know I've been depressed for years. But I don't see any reason to see a professional. They're not going to change my appearance or change anything that ails me. I don't want to learn to live with my “abnormality” (not talking about being guy, but rather my looks and strange way of being), I just want to be normal. Or not to be at all. Why go on living?

"There’s no way clear and I literally have no body in this world no family no one, it’s tough enough and on top of that I’m not very liked around so 🤷🏾‍♀️. it’s hate and set ups plus how hard it would be alone as a young woman , and because of hate it’s hard to be in society basically kicked out even if you want to do the smallest things, it’s gonna come with hassle because your are hated, I need to go in my sleep or someone who hates me the most can pop me with a pew pew. It’s hard to work myself up to do it, but I really wish I was dead nothing makes sense and when it comes to the hate. It’s ok to be alone in life but this was basically a campaign to ruin me and discard me, ppl get madder when I get angry at what has happened to me because some of the reasons still isn’t very clear , that’s ok if I can’t find victory in life , then it’s not for me , I feel I would feel all I need from God and away from fighting everything basically everyday, I really want to die , like it really became something I’ve wanted for so long almost everyday, because I can’t handle this stress anymore the hate wins! and I’ve made peace with that if I actually come in contact with dying I won’t stop it if I had a power to stop, it’s just hard to work yourself up to do, I just want it to be painless and not torture me so it’s quick is done, I’ve bought coolant but I’ve learnt that it can cause brain damage if not done right but if it was that you wouldn’t feel anything your done in some minutes, but if I mess that up I really mess up my life not only I would be alive I would be probably assisted living which I would just want to be dead, I feel like a noose takes too long and you feel it and I don’t really have access to other resources where I feel if I did it , it would be quick , so wish and hope all the time I just don’t wake up or , like a bullet just is a straight headshot so there’s no suffering from it , it just goes straight to the head and that’s it I don’t even feel it I’m gone in seconds, I wasn’t meant to be here, I’m all wrongThe worst part of this is the hate, I can stand alone otherwise, but it’s to much else to go through im done,",0
"TW: Self-h*rm, su*cidal thoughts, su*cide attempt‼️Long read but please bare with me, the storytelling is messy sorry I'm writing this while trying to hold my tears‼️I don't think I can handle this anymore. In my 18 years of living, I can handle any more torture and pain. I am f*cking done living. I f*cking hate my family, especially my dad. I hate my mom for tolerating what my dad does because ""discipline"" and because of ""religion."" I hate my younger brother for being a toxic male like my dad. And I especially hate my dad because of all the physical, mental, emotional, religious trauma, and baggage that he gave me. I don't think I'll last until my next birthday. I've been having su*cide thoughts again and recently I've been drinking 2-3 pills of whatever medication I can find. I f*cking hate living.It all started before I was born, my father is the carrier of the poison that is now flowing in my veins. He was almost 30, my mom is 21 and just graduated college. She got pregnant when she was 21 so based on that info, I think my dad was pursuing my mom since she was 19 or 20. When my mom got pregnant, her whole world broke and she isolated herself until her birth. She had abortion thoughts and I wish she did abort me, maybe then she would be happy and living her dream. I broke her dreams, I am the cause of it all. Thankfully her family accepted her and my dad showed up at my mom's house when I was around 2. I wish he didn't, maybe my life would've been completely different. Him and my mom got married and the rest was history. History of abuse that is. My earliest memory of being physically abused was when I was around 3 or 4. Haha ain't it funny, the very first memory I am conscious about is abuse. I vividly remember me crying near the doorway outside and my mom packing our things. Idk what happened then because I wasn't conscious enough. Then from then I'd get beat up whenever I make a mistake. Whether small or big, I was smacked with what my father can grab and he would hit me where the weapon would land. I can't even remember the rest of my childhood haha. Idk man. The physical abuse got worse as I grow up. I get compared to kids that are smarter than me, he's the one to do so yet he graduated with low grades. The peak of physical abuse was around 10-14. I can't remember much haha, sorry. He only stopped when I was 16 but he moved to mental and emotional abuse, no wait he didn't move he just amplified it a ton. Honestly I think this is the age I started to be reserved and more quiet, I also space out a lot and my memory went sh*t. I oversex*alize myself and I hate it. He didn't s*xually abuse me tho, I think it's because I think I deserve to be punished, to be beaten, even to be f*ckin killed. I had my very first s*icide attempt when I was around 14. I tried hanging myself, the rope snapped. I tried it 2 more times and the last time, I think it almost worked but one of our neighbor who is around my age saw me and got me down. From then on I think I got addicted of taking meds. I would take any meds I find and pop a pill or two(sometimes 3) haha. And now I'm 18, I'm starting to feel the effect. I swear something is wrong with me idk what tho haha but it's fine there are way bigger problems in the world than what am feeling. I guess this is also one of the reason why I am a big empath despite not feeling emotion other than constantly hating myself and my dad. I am feeling even more pressure now that I am gonna go in a university that the tuition is super not cheap and I need to maintain my scholarship to study there. I am not smart, never have been. It doesn't help too that my univ is just across where my whole family is living so I'll be living with them and attending the ""religion"" that also destroyed my mental health. Idk what to do man. I just wanna live my life. I'm thinking of ending it all before school starts. Idk anymore. It's either i die or my dad dies. Idk If I can plan a m*rder on him so I'll probably just kms. Hahaha sorry for being pathetic and acting like a pick me. Idk wjat to do. Everyday I hate myself and I drown myself with games, videos, p*rn, or anything just anything to feel something. I don't c*t myself because I feel like it's super messy and it'll be obvious I'm harming myself. I wanna f*cking die man, idk what to do anymore. I'm drowning and I'm too afraid to ask my friends for help because like an anchor, I might bring them down too and be a burden to them. Haha idk anymore If you're still reading, thank you. I'll delete this post in a few days or so. And I'll deact my reddit. Idk what to do anymore, probably overd*se myself hahaha ",0

"I always tried and I always kept failing. I had dreams, and i tried to make them come true but no matter what i did it didn't had any affect or it only made things worse. I've come to the realisation that i'll never be completely normal. I first thought about killing myself and went to a mental hospital when i was 10. My mom abuses me mentally, i'm not saying she is a bad person, i trully love her, but she've got her problems. My older sister is autistic and she scratches me whenever i upset her (she scratched me because i fell asleep while listening to music on my laptop, and she told me that the light from my laptop anoyed her. She was getting mad when i was clicking my laptop mouse while playing games or smth so i'm not doing that anymore) so now i have scars on my face. My parents are divorced, and she unfortunetly lives with my dad so i have to live with her, since i'd rather live with her than with my mom. I also have issues with food, and its the same thing. I've tried everything and i just can't anymore. Maybe i didn't tried hard enough. Maybe i should've pushed myself harder. Idk. I'm really tired. If anyone's interested i wrote more about this in my recent posts, especially my first. I really need some help. i've got a therapist and she's great, but every time i have an appointment with her (which is once in two weeks) i just can't speak. I'ts like i'm scared of trying to get better. I'm scared of trying to get better because i know that if i fail (and i most likely will) it wil hurt really bad. But i'm willing to give my life one last chance. I really need help. I don't want to kill myself, I'm 14, i know i'm young and i still can get better. Maybe i didn't tried hard enough last time or i gave up too soon. Probably both of those things. I don't know how i will conquer binge eating but i will try. I heard that as long as you're breathing  there is a way or smth like that. If that's true i'm willing to try, but please help me. I really don't want to lose another time, but i know that if I try i might succeed. I just need some support and advice. How do i find strenght and willpower to do this all? I'm super weak, and I honestly just can't believe that it will work. I try to believe in that but i never suceed so why should i succeed now? I'm really scared. Some part of me is saying that i should give up. I should give up and just kill myself, that would be easier. I just hope i'm not making a mistake by trying.",0
"I live with my parents currently and my main issue is no motivation to do anything, apathy (mild?), fatigue etc. Don’t know if that’s depression, don’t really care, you lot are probably quite numb/sad if you’re here and that’s how I feel so hopefully this fits the subreddit. Haven’t read the rules, if I’ve not followed them remove the post so on and so forth.I’m only 18, just finished school, life isn’t going great. My motivation is always at or next to 0 and I don’t think living with people that can support me is helping. I’m planning to move out (or at least half move out, my stuff will probably stay in parents’ house. I’ve thought about it a lot and I think finally getting a job and making myself face the possibility of homelessness is the only thing that will motivate me to not be a zombie. I want to experience physical rock bottom so I have a reason to do anything. It might not be a good idea, it might be a form of self sabotage or isolation, I don’t much care at this point; I struggle to comprehend a more depressing/hopeless mindset than I have right now, at least if I live physically like I do in my mind I’ll have a reason to be miserable. I have no reason to be miserable/numb right now, I just am. Maybe it’s normal. Don’t know, don’t care. Nothing I do makes me feel proud or happy for more than a few hours so I fail to see why I need a rent free house or no responsibilities. They don’t make me remotely happy so why bother with them really. Talking to people is tiring now and I really honestly don’t do much. I at least want to be independent and not live under my parents, afraid to spend money because it won’t come back. I can’t even trust my own words or actions anymore, it’s like I’m hollow and I don’t have full control. At least if I manage to live independently I’ll have something. It’s so small but it’s something I can hold onto to prove to myself that I’m not totally helpless.I want to be a writer. That’s the big dream, so I’ll focus on that. I’ll go to work, read when I can, I’ll come back and write. Maybe on the weekends I’ll go out with friends. I don’t seem to enjoy life much regardless of what’s happening to me right now but I want to feel something strong that isn’t hopelessness. If that’s sadness then so be it. It’ll probably get better soon, nothing lasts forever as they say.That might’ve turned into a rant. Not sure what it was supposed to be. Maybe asking for advice on how to go about it, if it’s a half decent idea (probably not). I don’t know, it’s more of a rant, feel free to ignore. Unless you’ve felt the same way with this weird self destruct thing, don’t ignore then.",0

"I'm 36. I have never been in a LTR and haven't been on a date in almost seven years. I have no friends and never have. I was alone in high school. I was alone in college. I was alone in grad school. I've been alone since then too. Basically no one other than my parents ever talks to me or asks about me.I have no professional successes to speak of. I work a shitty job that I'll be out of in a few months as the place I work is closing. I've never made more than $50K/yr in my life. I don't own a house. I haven't saved a lot for retirement because I've never been able to afford to. I'm currently living with my parents and going to sleep at night in the same room I did when I was a toddler. I wake up every morning hating myself and go to bed every night hating myself.I have no hobbies that I'm good at or passionate about. I've felt self-conscious about my appearance all my life and while when you're in middle school or high school, you can hold out hope that you'll come out the other side of puberty looking better or that you can go to the gym and get a great body, I'm now at that point in my life where I'm getting gray hairs and lines on my forehead. Not only do I have no hope of my appearance improving, it is just going to get worse from here.My parents are getting old. Everyone else my age is married and has kids and good jobs and houses and has moved on. I missed out on all the fun parts of life and have nothing left but taking care of my parents in their old age, burying them when they die, and then growing old alone and having nobody to do those things for me. Is anyone reading this who *wouldn't* be depressed in my situation? It would be irrational *not* to be depressed. My life has been an empty, miserable hell. So what is the point of trying? Why am I taking so many medications and spending so much time and money on therapists? Just so I can numb myself to how awful my life is? So I can try to keep that numbness up until I die of natural causes?",0
"There’s literally nothing stopping me from killing myself, except for my fear of the pain. I could never do it, no matter in what state I am in that moment. If suicide weren’t painful (because I assume it is), bruh, I would’ve been gone 10 years ago already. If there was like a button to turn just everything off, I would slap that button immediately and I know I won’t be the only one. I’m not religious, I’m an atheist, I don’t believe in an afterlife. If there were an afterlife, I wouldn’t even fucking want that and would try to end myself again in the afterlife LMAO. So that part isn’t stopping me either from doing it, I’m just scared that it won’t be successful or my last minutes are just gonna be suffering. I know plenty of you guys feel the same… bit of a pointless post, but there isn’t a day that goes by without me thinking about death and longing for it.",0
I just want to sleep and be awake at appropriate times. ,0
I suffer from a panic disorder anxiety and depression and I just don't like think I can take this world anymore. Today I've noticed how much hatred is in this planet and how much my family actually does not wamt me around and I can't even go in public without someone I use to be friends with making things up about me all because I finally left and ignored everyone. But you can only go so far. From being threated by my own family to getting my tires slashed over something as small as me blocking everyone and trying to stay away from the toxic people. And to top it off I've been dealing with panic and thinking everyday is going to be my last. There's so much that's been happening to me and I can't take one more second of it. I think it would be better if I just went off and starved to death in the woods or something so no one can find me and I can rot away. I simply can't stand being here any longer. I'm sorry. ,0

"im doing my best. i love meeting people and making new friends but i always feel outcasted. keep changing and making myself ""better"" but everytime i try to be someone im not i break down and start my shitty habbits like smoking and SH. i hate myself so much because of how i look or how i sound like. i hate how im always in pain. Like my head and my stomach always feels like its on fire or eating itself. And sometimes i cant even sleep. but some days i sleep the whole day away. i dont want to feel like this anymore. i just want to be normal. To be like everybody else. ",0
"From the overflow of the heart,You reach and reach with no avail. You give and give until you are empty. You strive to find purpose, yet in your search, you exhaust yourself completely. In one moment you are cared for; every other moment, you are forgotten. You are mistaken by others, for it is easier to judge than to love another. And the love you do have is nothing but fleeting words—never actions. The things you once looked forward to now sour and make you ill. And you bleed and bleed to find help, yet soon enough, help itself becomes distasteful—a voided husk of repeated answers to weigh one down. Answers often unsolicited, laced in pride and ignorance. For once others learn what help means for you, they realize they can't or won't help. You speak and speak and speak, yet no words come out. No one hears you. As the tree that falls in the forest does not make a sound, you also do not exist. You ask and ask, and ask—you ask for one thing. Yet no matter how many times you ask, God is slow to answer and is preoccupied. All together, you have become seemingly voiceless. A silence that eats itself out of spite. A screaming in  the depths of a shallow sea. The only time you are seen is when you are drastic—and even then, in your cries for help, you are labelled by those unable to truly understand your affliction. Only leaving a greater mess than that was before. Leading you to be even more shut-in; more hidden due to fear and misconstrue. Finally forming within you, a facade so convincing, so realistic; a facade bent on preventing others from seeing the actual you—and seeing your hurt. An act so real, that even you deceive yourself into thinking you are okay, that there is nothing wrong.Giving into an act of isolation through a fictitious front. Where loneliness becomes so apparent, so consuming. Creating into oneself a vicious desperation to belong and to be wanted. Where any rejection makes the thought of being under a knife admirable.  Where cosmetics become a way to love oneself, a mask to hide in. Where talents become not shows of passion but a currency for buying affection. Where looks and skills question, proclaiming ""Would you want me if I were this?"" A loneliness to motivate an endless toil to belong—to be seen—to be loved. A loneliness to take all warmth. A loneliness so deeply ingrained that it starts to shape and define you.And when it all gets to be too much again. With this repetitious fall and climb into insanity, a trying insanity being your only sanity. When you get to the edge. With these forgotten fragments of script; these torn-up pieces of yourself. When it seems the Reaper opens a welcoming embrace to you. Gripped by a crushed spirit. With thoughts that used to torment that now comfort. You become faced with a truly terrifying decision, an utterly terrifying unknown.A decision into an unknown more unknown than any other—that stiffens one step, that saps one strength. An unknown that drains dreams and desire from one's very being, very soul. An unknown that takes all. And faced with this terror, with dread stalling movements forward and memory siphoning all power left to escape, you become trapped. Imprisoned between the lines of destruction and hopelessness. Glued to a perpetuating suffocating misery. Snared by a loop of a self brought about hell in the inability to complete a task. Forced to suffer a slow death due to the fear of death itself.  And the more you try to run from this despair, the closer it gets. If you stand still, it still overtakes you. What can you do? Though you fight for better days, what can you do? And if only the heart was a bottomless well, then it wouldn't overflow into writing. Yet it seems bottomless because the heart is still longing. ",0

Is it just me? I find that this happens a lot. I feel extra rotten because I had a good therapy session yesterday (my therapist praised me and everything!) so I feel like I faked my progress.

I never thought I’d end up where I’m at nor did I ever think that feeling this low and mental pain like this was even possible. A few hours ago I started cutting the fuck out of my arm. I’m not entirely sure why but honestly it feels good as fuck. Not the cutting or pain of it obviously but just something about it after just feels great. I approached a good friend of mine who I knows been there heavily and I vented about how I feel and talked about how somehow for some reason I’m here. He said it’s honestly a gateway drug that starts with chicken scratches and ends up with bear knives and ur blood hitting the ceiling. I know it’s probably a little exaggerated but I do know he’s really fucked his shit up. He advised me not too but here I am. Idk I guess I’d just share.,0
So I am trying to see a psychiatrist and see if that will help with my self loathing and suicidal ideations. Honestly doubtful but at least I can I tried.,0

I want to say ""at least if I do, I can do something to change my life"" but, to be honest, the idea of changing my life sounds terrifying to me.

"I have to admit, shamefully, that l used to be a bully.I could say that I hung out with the wrong people, which is true, but the bullying started with me. I said terrible and disgusting things, especially to a person I'll call Jerry. He didn't have it easy. His father had cancer, and his family was deeply in debt, and yes, that's exactly what I made fun of (I could punch myself in the face). At first, it was only behind his back, but as the group got bigger, the cooler I wanted to appear, and I said something horrible to his face, and he wasn't impressed. I never had any problems with teachers or his family because of it, which I deserved, but luckily I didn't, but l'll get to that later. His father died, and he had to repeat a year because he missed so much school, even before his father started chemotherapy, and so on. I also had to repeat a year because of a grade. I was separated from my friends and put into a class with Jerry. We ended up just ignoring each other. He's introverted with people anyway, except for me now, and I didn't make any friends in a class where nobody knew me. When I started bullying, it stayed that way for a while, but I found a friend in the class whom I now call Sam. Sam was also friends with Jerry, which I didn't know. For two days, we went on a school trip and were allowed to visit the zoo in groups of four. So, it was me, Jerry, Sam, and someone irrelevant to the story. We formed a group.By then, I had changed so much that I wanted to talk to Jerry, and we did, discovering we had a lot of shared interests. The topic came up, and I tried to downplay it, but it almost made him angry, so l let it go and sincerely apologized for everything I had done. He accepted the apology and said, ""I know you mean it and that you will do better in the future.I forgive you."" I was speechless that someone I had treated so badly would say something like that to me. Today, we are both 22 and 21 and are best friends, but I haven't forgiven myself. Sometimes, when I am alone, I think about these things, start to cry, and wonder if I even deserve his friendship.",0
"Every waking moment of my life is just suffering. People tell me not to compare myself to others but how am I supposed to avoid that when it's always other people around me? All I see is people who are way happier than me and have way more interesting lives. All I can do is feel hopeless and post stuff on Reddit about how I want to fucking give up on everything. I just have no energy or desire to do anything at this point because why bother? I'm a grown-ass adult who's never even felt the touch of a woman, let alone had sex and doesn't have anything interesting to talk about. Also I'm ugly as hell so that makes it even worse. I genuinely hope I get fucked by some random person so I at least don't have to suffer anymore.",0
