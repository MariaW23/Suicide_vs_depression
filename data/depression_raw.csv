###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,4,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2368,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2368,,False,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1572360722.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

I also at this time found a girlfriend. She left me not too long after and it didnt help my case. 

I have been to multiple psychiatrists, received multiple diagnoses, and have gotten countless of ""just go outside! youll feel much better"".

I've tried therapy but it's not helping much I feel nothing can help me anymore.

My heart feels sore from being in this state. It's probably an exaggeration. But it feels like that. It feels like it has been put on a fridge. You know that feeling when you touch something frozen and your fingers feel numb and hurt you? My heart feels like that.

,depression,"Hello Everyone, 
First of all, I hope you're all doing great.

I (F/29) am having a rather hard time mentally these past few weeks, since I'm struggling with feelings of loneliness, emotional neglect, depression (I think) and just a sense of not being important in relation to my family (mother &amp; younger brother).

Most of the struggles I am currently still going through, is related to a sudden MS Diagnosis I received almost exactly a year ago &amp; multiple other smaller health issus that had to be taken care of &amp; addressed until recently.

Since I've always been rather athletic and took care of my health meticulously since my teenage years, all these sudden health issues felt like life was playing a bad joke on me.
In addition to that, I didn't have a full time job (just part-time), since my diagnosis, because it happend right after graduating from college and everything just hit me like a train.
My mother, has supported me financially throughout this time and I am extremely grateful for her helping me out and promised to pay her back in thime (I always keep my word, I think it's only fair). 
Currently I am applying for full-time positions in my field again, because the financial burden has become to great for my mother (understandably) and I also only want to live a normal life again and get back on track.

Now just earlier, I talked with my mom on the phone and had gotten really emotional, communicating that I had suicidal ideations after her constant harsh treatment towards me (telling me I need to learn to deal with everything on my own and not look for emotional support in regards to my MS etc.) and that I didn't understand why - or felt like they don't take my illness seriously (fatigue - especially in this summer heat, numb &amp; painful hand, fear of the future etc.). She answered in her usual way of saying that she didn't want to talk &amp; that it is my decision to end my life - nothing she can do about it.
My brother, unfortunately also leans towards a rather stoic and emotionless respons in situations where I would appreciate some kind words. 
That's all I want. Not to be kicked when I already feel at my lowest... 
This is not the first time, she told me this, when I communicated my hurts to her, and it freaking hurts like hell when she talks to me in this way. 
 
I pushed myself through so many appointments for an entire year, without having any help or assistance from anyone.
I live alone, my apartment is spotless, I'm trying to get my energy back and am working with a great neurologist to get my energy levels back again after all these medical precedures etc.
I'm taking part in a research study for future MS treatments and applying for jobs again.
I communicated to my family that I would appreciated them visiting or at least calling me more &amp; asking how I'm doing, but they just don't get it. 
They just don't seem to care or see what I have gone through or how much effort I put into things - trying to fix my life again.
My mother told me today, that:
""You're not sick. You can still do everything as before.""

I AM SICK - I PUSH THROUGH SO NO ONE SEES HOW FREAKING TIRED &amp; FATIGUED I AM ALL OF THE TIME! SO EVERYONE KEEPS FEELING COMFORTABLE SINCE APPARENTLY THEY CAN'T DEAL WITH PEOPLE HAVING A HARD TIME OR BEING SAD ONCE DURING A FULL MOON OR FEELING LONELY SINCE NO ONE COMES TO VISIT FOR 5 MONTHS! 
(Sorry about that...)
Even hours of talking on the phone and trying to explain myself is a lost cause and only ends up in me being gaslit &amp; putting all of the emotional responsibilities onto me again. 
I guess we actually don't need any human connection or support when I apply the logic of my family.

I'm not so delusional to think that I won't reclaim the life that I want and always strived for. 
I just had bad luck for a bit over a year I suppose. 
It happens. 

The only thing I need &amp; actually always wanted, is being heard, loved and just seen for who I am, what I feel and how I experience my reality. 
It just feels like I can scream as loud as I want &amp; cry as much as I want and no one is listening. 
I'm so exhausted.
I just want a hug.

,depression,"My first memory (either 2 or 3 years old) is a screaming match between my mom and dad, after which, my dad left in his car for several hours and I believed he was never coming home again. While he was a good father in other ways, it doesn't excuse the selfish and childlike behavior my dad subjected me and my family to growing up. Of all the memories I have of my dad, the ones that are most prominent and stand out the most are of him screaming at me, belittling me, only to sweep it under the rug a day or so later with some bullshit apology and a present to buy my apology. Additionally, he neglected to socialize me almost entirely, making it so that I basically had to develop all my social skills from scratch *way* later than my peers. This is how I learned to always be incredibly submissive to the wants and anger of other people, leading me down a childhood/adolescence of bullying, isolation, depression, and (the worst in my opinion) depersonalization/lack of identity. To cope I became a chameleon, adopting the personality of those around me with truly no inherent grasp of my own. 

Besides my lack of social ability as a child, I was bullied and tormented by others because of reasons beyond my control, namely racism and people who told their children to dislike me because of my family. In school I was incredibly studious and tried to be kind to everyone. That never helped at all. It was constant torment, (never physical, just emotional) as I was meticulously pulled apart by people because I was different. While I was able to have a handful of friends, bad luck resulted in every friend I made moving away by the point I had entered middle school. I was incredibly lonely, and basically just drifted those few years. Once in high school, I made it my mission to join what I saw as the popular crew (keep in mind, what I *saw* as lack of any social skills blinded me to the fact that these guys were the worst douchebags and everyone hated them). To do this, I basically hung around long enough to the point where I was just part of the group by association, even though it basically meant I was their punching bag for verbal abuse and always being the butt of the joke. My positive memories with them have nothing to do with anything good happening, just being moments where they didn't tear me to shreds with their words. But being around the group made people dislike me more by associate because they disliked these guys for being total jerks. So essentially, not only was I getting bullied more regularly and intensely now, but everyone else hated me because they thought I was like them. 

For sake of not making this incredibly long, I'm skipping over a lot of detail and nuance. But after high school, my life began to improve dramatically. I made better friend groups with people who actually were kind to me and friendly, I went to college and began to discover myself, all was well. And then covid hit and we all went home and I lost all my newly gained friends. And I was back at home, alone. 

At that point I was at the roughest point in my life. It was like I had finally been given a taste of what having fun and being young was about, and it was ripped away from me almost instantly. Even once I returned to college, my core friend group just sort of fell apart and didn't hang out, and I spent most of my time in my dorm (still covid so couldn't go into common area and meet people) by myself doing drugs and playing video games. I barely made it through the semester and honestly was probably on track to dropping out the next simply because of how unhappy and riddled with depression I was. 

Over break, I met someone through mutual friends and we instantly fell for each other. She was my first significant other, even counting all the lame middle/high school relationships which I was never a part of. We were so in love. And it was good, and compassionate, and caring, and respectful. She was a shining beam of light in my life that I never had before and she validated all the struggle and pain I went through in my life. I was able to tell her about myself, and she, also coming from a place of incredible trauma, was able to truly relate and understand me. It was the first time in my life I felt I ever had anyone genuinely know and care about me as a person. While part of me was just okay with having someone to make my deep seated insecurities pushed to the side, I know that this was actually true love and I was truly happy with her. We were even having talks about potentially buying a house and getting married.

We stayed together through the remainder of college, during which my grades improved drastically. After graduating, after we had been together many years, our relationship ended in a hellish fireball I never saw coming. In the span of a few months we went from ""perfect"" to horribly toxic. She left me, lied to me, took advantage of me financially, abused me emotionally, used things I told her in confidence against me, and cheated on me. I did everything I could to repair the damage as it happened but it was gone and destroyed. I begged to fix things and try to patch things up but she treated me like garbage, like I was a stranger and didn't know her. 

In the many months after, I was horribly depressed and suicidal. I honestly don't know how I made it through everything I did all alone (I should add, during/after my relationship I had lost nearly all my friends, some through falling outs, some as they were originally hers, but mostly just through growing up and having our own lives). I focused on myself and my career and was able to make it through, as difficult as it was. I recognized looking back obvious red flags in our relationship which I had thought of as minor road bumps we could conquer together initially. I don't want her back now, and I would never let her back into my life. But in all honesty, those years with her were the happiest years of my life by far, and nothing even remotely compares to it. When I look back at my life, even with consideration that those years were the most recent, they make up the overwhelming majority of truly happy memories in my lifetime. 

So now we reach my current life. I am at a great job with great pay and great potential to move into other positions making incredible money, not just for someone my age, but great for anyone. I have an apartment in a good neighborhood where I live peacefully and make myself healthy food and life an overall good life from an outward perspective. 

But internally I'm dead inside. I have a toxic family dynamic, no real friends, and no longer any significant other in my life. The irony is, that even now, as lonely as I am, when I reach out for any of those categories I get a full dose of either shitty parenting, shitty friends, or shitty situation ships where I don't even care about the other person. It's like I'm a ping pong ball caught between being lonely or dealing with horrible people as I just can't seem to find someone who is tolerable (ie: doesn't abuse me and actually wants to spend time with me \[impossible combo\]). The only feelings I have are complete numbness and then random bouts of horrible despair and depression where whatever I'm doing comes to a complete halt as I mentally deal with it to prevent from spiraling. On occasion I feel incredibly manic (I'm going to conquer the world, become a billionaire, etc. etc.) which usually is quickly followed by more depression. This can all occur on a daily basis. I have to gaslight myself to get anything done. I'd say I'm fairly productive, but unless I trick myself into performing basic self care, things won't get done. 

Even in moving on, my current trauma and pathetic social skills (note how I don't say shyness, I really mean social skills) put a strong buffer on my ability to build new relationships. I think the worst thing of all is that I truly loved and still do love all the horrible people in my life. I've always just wished they would accept me, and I could never understand the reasoning why not. I don't know why I still feel drawn to many of these people, as many of them were actually terrible and took full advantage of me. Yet I just have that wish to be loved and this pain of rejection that I wish above all else they would just love me. 

I have been to therapy, but it didn't help. I plan on returning with someone new, but I am just so tired all the time. As stupid as it sounds, I wish I could just wish there to be a single person in my life who would hold my hand (literally and metaphorically) when life gets tough and guide me along. I wish there was someone who I could place my absolute faith in without the constant fear that they would undercut me and leave me for dead. I wish there was someone who, when they tell me something, I can believe it without knowing they are a liar. I know it's possible for someone to be this person, because I've been this person in nearly all the relationships throughout my life. 

But for now I keep going because there's nothing else to do. I don't plan on going anywhere, even though I am not hopeful. I do my best to improve myself in whatever ways I can. And I do continue to try to reach out to people, even though stuff never works out at all. Even posting this, in a way, is really just a way for me to get some of the social interaction I'm lacking. 

I hope if you're reading this and you can relate that you've gotten better/are in the process of getting better.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t always feel like this but I do go through weeks and weeks like this. Just getting deeper and deeper into this crap. Currently I feel bad but good about certain things, or optimistic about others (for example job expectations, friendships or body image). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Btw: therapy is 100% not an option. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"(rant) i’ve been depressed for 3 years now. but this summer really made me realize that i am so comforted by my loneliness that i don’t expect much from people anymore. nothing good ever stays. i feel my emotions differently than i did last year. i just feel numb now instead of crying all the time. i have my bestfriend but i feel so annoying to them but i know they love me (somehow). i can’t stand to keep anyone around me, so i leave before they do. i have different coping mechanisms than i did last year (still bad ones). i’ve changed without even realizing it, but it’s never in a good way. i’m still lonely and sad and always will be.

why can’t i appreciate what i have? why do i change so much? what is for me?

,depression,"A year ago, I had everything. 

Biggest savings I ever had, a nice car, the dream gadgets, the wardrobe I couldn’t afford, the food that I can eat anytime I want (cause finally, I could)

A few friendships that matters and see my worth, a good running businesses, an experienced advisor and my grandmother in her best shape.

But this year, I slowly lost everything. 

Money in the bank. The dream gadgets. The clothes, shoes and bags. Friendships that I cherish than material things. Businesses. Advisor. And I’m slowly loosing my grandmother (due to the big C) and I hope NOT my car cause it’s the last thing I have. 

Sometimes, I wonder, I mean often, that I deserve this, that I need to go through this. Cause what doesn’t kill us make us stronger, right?

I can’t help but to cry every time I remember everything I lost.

I’m clinging to one thing - out of all the things gone, I gained the most important thing I ever thought I wouldn’t have. The person I want to be with for the rest of my life. 

I’m giving all the strength that was left in me to create a new chapter of my life with her. Cause I’m really not getting any younger. I’m beyond thankful for her and I wish she really is the person I’m looking for. Cause everything I lost - IT’S ALL WORTH IT.

But as I was saying now dating I don’t even have the courtesy of a normal conversation I’m treated like I’m stupid and like I’m indifferent, and also when I go through tough situations I tend to get in a place I’m alone and say my thoughts out loud because it gets it off my chest and not every time I want to speak to someone about this it has always been a secret place for me that I would never give out because I know I humiliation but it is my way of coping but what happened is during this because I guess ppl wanted to see what’s up with me and be nosey they found out I do this and because it’s a habit when I am going through a lot I end in a quiet place and let my thoughts out I can’t stop right away especially now you have so much against me like family everybody around and cyber bullying too I triggers this even more I guess and I can look to be overwhelmed, and that gets thrown in my face subtly when dating, then ppl just want to take advantage of me because of the situation with the guy absolutely no one heard me out it’s like automatically it was my fault and I was just a easy gold digger , and ppl keep trying to treat me like that even though I keep pushing that idea away I’ve ended up in two relationships since this happened that didn’t last but I would always let them know they never have to do things for me for me to stay then I would accept them doing it then they would be like acting like so the rumours are true anything to make a point I feel since this date with this guy and since this situation I have lost my job and not able to work functionally because like I said ppl are bullying me there to so yes there were times that I was in need and the ppl I loved made me feel like they didn’t have a problem which I would always try to make it up when I can in the best way I can , but that only came around when ppl was trying to prove a point that this is who I am and when the harassment took a toll on me not before when I first dated the guy so I truly don’t understand why, but everyone hates me. It’s like ppl know this isn’t my character but is wanting to set everything up for me to be pushed down that road for especially family I feel you would’ve wanted to pluck me out this mess and tell me the full truth on how it even got to them cuz I’m in a different country , and if they truly had my back like they said they wouldn’t let these ppl be my end all be all we would get back on even if it was with simply motivation and honesty but they don’t give me that.

But as I was saying now dating I don’t even have the courtesy of a normal conversation I’m treated like I’m stupid and like I’m indifferent, and also when I go through tough situations I tend to get in a place I’m alone and say my thoughts out loud because it gets it off my chest and not every time I want to speak to someone about this it has always been a secret place for me that I would never give out because I know I humiliation but it is my way of coping but what happened is during this because I guess ppl wanted to see what’s up with me and be nosey they found out I do this and because it’s a habit when I am going through a lot I end in a quiet place and let my thoughts out I can’t stop right away especially now you have so much against me like family everybody around and cyber bullying too I triggers this even more I guess and I can look to be overwhelmed, and that gets thrown in my face subtly when dating, then ppl just want to take advantage of me because of the situation with the guy absolutely no one heard me out it’s like automatically it was my fault and I was just a easy gold digger , and ppl keep trying to treat me like that even though I keep pushing that idea away I’ve ended up in two relationships since this happened that didn’t last but I would always let them know they never have to do things for me for me to stay then I would accept them doing it then they would be like acting like so the rumours are true anything to make a point I feel since this date with this guy and since this situation I have lost my job and not able to work functionally because like I said ppl are bullying me there to so yes there were times that I was in need and the ppl I loved made me feel like they didn’t have a problem which I would always try to make it up when I can in the best way I can , but that only came around when ppl was trying to prove a point that this is who I am and when the harassment took a toll on me not before when I first dated the guy so I truly don’t understand why, but everyone hates me. It’s like ppl know this isn’t my character but is wanting to set everything up for me to be pushed down that road for especially family I feel you would’ve wanted to pluck me out this mess and tell me the full truth on how it even got to them cuz I’m in a different country , and if they truly had my back like they said they wouldn’t let these ppl be my end all be all we would get back on even if it was with simply motivation and honesty but they don’t give me that.

,depression,"I believe only reason to live is experience new things you didn't experience before and see the forwards. I don't want to do repeating activities.

When I was younger I was fillling myself with vast amount of knowledge found on Internet. Educating myself further I have collected knowledge in programming, graphics design and chemistry. Learning about something new everyday is what made me what I'm.  My personality is revolved around things that interest me, I do not have any friends who are interested in common things I do, lack of large friend group and being socially awkward doesn't make things any better but I grew up to tolerate it better. I'm diagnosed with Autism under label of PDD-NOS in age of 6 and I got rediagnosed at age 16.  
I absorb knowledge easily, produce solutions and give answers to people or simply whoever is interested in my ideas. I like dumping large amounts of knowledge to whoever I meet.

Yeah sure there are still large amount of things to learn, and it's impossible to collect all of them, but I can know enough to do many things and so anyone else can with spare time that everyone lacks after their childhood. I'm basically forced this way due to not being able to socialize properly, I want to build whatever I'm imagining myself, alone. This is pretty irrational since it is not possible to a single person to finish things in short amount of time, but this is what I'm. I will never able to have coworkers, or be a boss. Limting factor is how humans are made to work. Everything has a hierarchy it never changed since ancient times. Humans with greater power control ones with less power and those control even ones with less power but at the absolute bottom these ones are so weak they cannot be controlled and there are people so strong they cannot be controlled.

Almost everything in past has a noticeable pattern. We cannot prove everything has a direct cause since how we exist is even a question at it's own that cannot be explained in a logical way. So many just prefer having a religion or simply don't mind personally I'm agnostic, there's no way to disprove or prove a creator so it's undefined. But in our current time frame almost everything has a input and output aka cause and result,  cause and result relationship cannot be well estabilished in many scenarios so this caused inaccuracy in reasoning, but for cases it can it allows a way to understand how everything ""resonates"" in a good balance. There's a pattern in way things work. Understanding relationships between different phenomena allows one of most powerful ways to learn new information, reason and produce new information.

This gets to the point of you notice everything has so many common things you feel like you are just way too much full of information and cannot produce valid results for people who expect it. You notice how humans are still ""pre-programmed""  like other animals do but at a lesser extent.

You notice that many things interested you were in your childhood, when you had strongest ability to connect the dots and understand patterns which this ability diminishes as you age.  
I'm hungry for knowledge, I seek more knowledge and at end I'm still unhappy. Most of things we learn could been logically deducted from limited amount of knowledge you have. You notice that you can predict how something will end up before you read detailed information about a topic and you see you were generally right from start.

This is what happened to me, what is the point of living even? I'm aware existental crisis can happen to anyone else but this is going for almost half a year. I enjoy nothing new,

I live in Turkey where people even would have harder time to be great at what they are and instead forced into unknown situations in the moment they turn 18. When I was young I acted quite weird I would dream about things and flap my hands involuntarily when doing that, I was beaten up in school by teacher, I was subjected to multiple intelligence tests in my childhood as another result of my weirdness and somehow I did well in these tests those were only tests that I did score somewhat good, my mother always tell me ""you are smart whatever you are doing is weird I'm starting to doubt your intelligence"". I recently become obsessed with taking online IQ tests, I took so many of them and yet I got similar scores as I did in my childhood score which was 115, online scores were between range of 100 to 120. Still I believe I'm dumbest person around with small set of friends I have. Reminder that average IQ for Turkey is 87, considering that being almost 2 standard deviations above the average of the country is huge. This score isn't even in gifted range or something would give a person very superior abilities to the point they would be cogntiveily successful in almost anything mentally demanding. It's simply high average to bright intelligence for western countries. Nothing more nothing less at best I'm an awful software engineer with that. I struggle with even simple maths that even a person with lower intelligence can do maths at better speed than I can, I may able to understand it more detailed but they will still do it faster than me because I'm very very slow in daily life except for learning things.  
I always mistake left and right, fail to follow directions correctly and have trouble understanding whatever they are trying to tell. I don't have an exact personality, It varies a lot, my limited set of friends say that my opinions suddenly changed, my opinions change so suddenly about a topic 10 minutes ago I would be saying  something else and now I would say something else, my brain is simply broken and not knowing about what could be cause of it is horrible, I'm not even sure if diagnoses I received to date are entirely correct.

I feel like I'm losing a lot of my abilities, I had ability to learn something extremely fast and catch details but my  ability in this area seems to be decline back then when it takes to learn from one small wikipedia article with roughly 2000 words took one read now it takes two or three reads to remember the concept perfectly for long time.  
I had strong tonal memory which I would able to memorize music and play it in head, it's kind like what people call as ""earworms"" but I was able to control mine and play whatever I wanted. I was able to keep a piece of music for 10+ years without forgeting it but now memorizing a piece of song is huge struggle for me. It barely even lasts a day, sometimes I forget within 10 minutes. I want my ability of remembering any song I hear back so much. It at least made my life more fun while it lasted.

Overally I'm a person that many won't find interesting at all, I see no value in myself too. My currently only reason to exist is to see how well it'll turn out, if I manage to experience more good memories then I'll live if not then I'll end it up before turning 30 possibly by taking a shot to head.

At least before I die I want to leave world my mark it might be small and irrelevant as hundreds of thousands already do it every year, people publish papers Elsevier and Springer profit from their papers and they receive almost nothing from it. Millions of papers reference each other and build a huge network of research to be exploited by major corporations (this includes news sites milking stuff out of research and turn it into clickbait)  
World is such a shitty place that people are manipulated with money, money is the single most important discovery as in sense of human psychology, making unwilling participants to work together. Collaborate something that other animals mostly lack. Money was and is required to build the world we know of. Wish people can see the entire point is discovering things.",t2_xeps8037k,False,,0,False,Feeling like I experienced everything I want to experience and losing abilities over time,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1egt48s,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,1722447661.0,,[],{},,True,,1722447132.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe only reason to live is experience new things you didn&amp;#39;t experience before and see the forwards. I don&amp;#39;t want to do repeating activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was younger I was fillling myself with vast amount of knowledge found on Internet. Educating myself further I have collected knowledge in programming, graphics design and chemistry. Learning about something new everyday is what made me what I&amp;#39;m.  My personality is revolved around things that interest me, I do not have any friends who are interested in common things I do, lack of large friend group and being socially awkward doesn&amp;#39;t make things any better but I grew up to tolerate it better. I&amp;#39;m diagnosed with Autism under label of PDD-NOS in age of 6 and I got rediagnosed at age 16.&lt;br/&gt;
I absorb knowledge easily, produce solutions and give answers to people or simply whoever is interested in my ideas. I like dumping large amounts of knowledge to whoever I meet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah sure there are still large amount of things to learn, and it&amp;#39;s impossible to collect all of them, but I can know enough to do many things and so anyone else can with spare time that everyone lacks after their childhood. I&amp;#39;m basically forced this way due to not being able to socialize properly, I want to build whatever I&amp;#39;m imagining myself, alone. This is pretty irrational since it is not possible to a single person to finish things in short amount of time, but this is what I&amp;#39;m. I will never able to have coworkers, or be a boss. Limting factor is how humans are made to work. Everything has a hierarchy it never changed since ancient times. Humans with greater power control ones with less power and those control even ones with less power but at the absolute bottom these ones are so weak they cannot be controlled and there are people so strong they cannot be controlled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everything in past has a noticeable pattern. We cannot prove everything has a direct cause since how we exist is even a question at it&amp;#39;s own that cannot be explained in a logical way. So many just prefer having a religion or simply don&amp;#39;t mind personally I&amp;#39;m agnostic, there&amp;#39;s no way to disprove or prove a creator so it&amp;#39;s undefined. But in our current time frame almost everything has a input and output aka cause and result,  cause and result relationship cannot be well estabilished in many scenarios so this caused inaccuracy in reasoning, but for cases it can it allows a way to understand how everything &amp;quot;resonates&amp;quot; in a good balance. There&amp;#39;s a pattern in way things work. Understanding relationships between different phenomena allows one of most powerful ways to learn new information, reason and produce new information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gets to the point of you notice everything has so many common things you feel like you are just way too much full of information and cannot produce valid results for people who expect it. You notice how humans are still &amp;quot;pre-programmed&amp;quot;  like other animals do but at a lesser extent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You notice that many things interested you were in your childhood, when you had strongest ability to connect the dots and understand patterns which this ability diminishes as you age.&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m hungry for knowledge, I seek more knowledge and at end I&amp;#39;m still unhappy. Most of things we learn could been logically deducted from limited amount of knowledge you have. You notice that you can predict how something will end up before you read detailed information about a topic and you see you were generally right from start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what happened to me, what is the point of living even? I&amp;#39;m aware existental crisis can happen to anyone else but this is going for almost half a year. I enjoy nothing new,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in Turkey where people even would have harder time to be great at what they are and instead forced into unknown situations in the moment they turn 18. When I was young I acted quite weird I would dream about things and flap my hands involuntarily when doing that, I was beaten up in school by teacher, I was subjected to multiple intelligence tests in my childhood as another result of my weirdness and somehow I did well in these tests those were only tests that I did score somewhat good, my mother always tell me &amp;quot;you are smart whatever you are doing is weird I&amp;#39;m starting to doubt your intelligence&amp;quot;. I recently become obsessed with taking online IQ tests, I took so many of them and yet I got similar scores as I did in my childhood score which was 115, online scores were between range of 100 to 120. Still I believe I&amp;#39;m dumbest person around with small set of friends I have. Reminder that average IQ for Turkey is 87, considering that being almost 2 standard deviations above the average of the country is huge. This score isn&amp;#39;t even in gifted range or something would give a person very superior abilities to the point they would be cogntiveily successful in almost anything mentally demanding. It&amp;#39;s simply high average to bright intelligence for western countries. Nothing more nothing less at best I&amp;#39;m an awful software engineer with that. I struggle with even simple maths that even a person with lower intelligence can do maths at better speed than I can, I may able to understand it more detailed but they will still do it faster than me because I&amp;#39;m very very slow in daily life except for learning things.&lt;br/&gt;
I always mistake left and right, fail to follow directions correctly and have trouble understanding whatever they are trying to tell. I don&amp;#39;t have an exact personality, It varies a lot, my limited set of friends say that my opinions suddenly changed, my opinions change so suddenly about a topic 10 minutes ago I would be saying  something else and now I would say something else, my brain is simply broken and not knowing about what could be cause of it is horrible, I&amp;#39;m not even sure if diagnoses I received to date are entirely correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I&amp;#39;m losing a lot of my abilities, I had ability to learn something extremely fast and catch details but my  ability in this area seems to be decline back then when it takes to learn from one small wikipedia article with roughly 2000 words took one read now it takes two or three reads to remember the concept perfectly for long time.&lt;br/&gt;

Pero kahit anong saya ko sa kanya o kahit anong saya namin sa isat isa, nababaliw na talaga ako. Meron paring sad spot na natitira sa buhay ko, sa puso ko. Nakakalungkot lang kase di rin ako makapag share ng nararamdaman ko sa kanya kase feeling ko di sya interesado. Minsan din kase nangyari na pinangaralan nya ako o pinagsabihan lang nung nag express ako sa kanya ng thoughts ko. I do felt na nainvalidate talaga yung feelings ko kaya siguro nawalqn na rin ako ng lakas ng loob na magsabi sa kanya.

Masaya lang kami haha, since the beginning wala pa talaga kaming nagiging pagtatalo. Kung meron man yung mga minor lang like 2 mins okay na kami agad. Pero kahit anong saya ko sa kanya o kahit anong saya namin sa isat isa, nababaliw na talaga ako. Meron paring sad spot na natitira sa buhay ko, sa puso ko. Nakakalungkot lang kase di rin ako makapag share ng nararamdaman ko sa kanya kase feeling ko di sya interesado. Minsan din kase nangyari na pinangaralan nya ako o pinagsabihan lang nung nag express ako sa kanya ng thoughts ko. I do felt na nainvalidate talaga yung feelings ko kaya siguro nawalqn na rin ako ng lakas ng loob na magsabi sa kanya. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ngayon naiisip ko nalang na pagod na pagod na ko sa buhay ko. Na para saan rin ba to e wala naman akong maabot abot. Halo halo na sila e. I actually want to tell more kaso pagod na ako. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m barely holding on and feels like malapit ko nang putulin yung thread na kinakapitan ko. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so fvcking sick and tired of my life. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Basically Im writing this so I can get an opinion about how I've feeling since childhood. I never had the money to go to a therapist of any kind but I just want to get this over with and start by identifying what it is.

I come from an extremely abusive family with a narc father that prayed upon my mother when she was a teenager and thats how I basically came about. During my childhood I have witnessed many fights, physical and verbal that have left me with terrible overthinking and anxiety to the point of not being able to speak in school or any other places. Ever since I was little I have known that there was something very wrong happening within my family and life but I didnt manage to see the extent untill I became a teen. Besides this, as a lesbian, I grew up being a more masculine girl and I really liked wearing boys clothes, cutting my hair short and stuff like that, all of which my father berrated me for. Calling me insane, ugly and stupid, while I was between the ages of 7 to 13.

When I was 16 my mother thankfully left my father and took me with her, we had to get a restraining order, but he still messaged us and followed us on the street. During this time my mother got with one of her coworkers that she had known for some time. At the start it was ok, but he and my mother got into very intense fights from time to time which only reminded me of our previous life. I also want to mention that ever since I can remember I just can not find it me to trust or befriend men, let alone live peacefully in the same house with one.

Eventually my mom, stepdad and I moved toghether in an apartment and from then on their fights only got worse. Stuff about cheating, who does what chores and whatnot. After some time this guy started complaining to my mom about every single piece of dust in the house that bothered him, including me leaving my coat on the hanger beside the door when I got home and other insignificant crap like that. There was one particularly bad fight that led him to brake like half of the plates in the house and another time where they were yelling so loud that the police car patroling the area heard them from the street and came up to ask what was happening to them. I had to live like this with them for about a year of constant fighting and breaking things, before I got so fed up by them that I flat out told that asshole if he broke one more thing of my mothers I would drag him out and leave him out for the whole night. Apparently he got extremely ""depressed"" by what I told him and my mother said he feels like this is not his home anymore. Like I would give a shit after all the stuff I had to hear from him for a whole year.

My mother said that she would find me a place to stay and that she would cover the rent as long as I cover the bills with what I get from my part time job while I also go to uni. I agreed, Ive been wanting to live on my own for quite some time, unfortunately living with other people never went that well for me. Ive never known a house of peace and quiet untill I finally moved by myself.

I explained all of this to give some context of why I am felling so unmotivated and down all of the time, all of this plus the bullying from middleschool, my terrible highschool experience in the pandemic coupled with my parents messed up break up, threats from my father, constant fighting all around, lack of meaningfull friendships and experiences, all of these have led me to where I am now. Even tho things are better I still cant shake this feeling of mental tiredness and lack of motivation to grow in any way. My only meaningfull relationship now is with my long distance girlfriend who I dont get to see as often as we would like, and my mother.

I have the feeling that all of these things that happened to me and my mom have soured our relationship and its not as good as it once was, but everytime I try to talk to her about this she either says its my fault or tells me that Im imagining things.

I have considered suicide from as early as 11 years old, pretty much only imagining how and when I would do it, but never actually made a solid plan to follow. Its been like am anchor for me, anytime things got really bad I would think about it and it almost brought me comfort sometimes. By the time mom broke up with my father I have stopped wanting to do it eventually, but the feeling remains. I dont have the energy to do things I wish I could, I dont have the energy to socialise, the school Im going to doesnt interest me at all, my part time job that I got is ok I guess but thats pretty much all that I feel like Im able do to. The rest of my time is spent playing videogames, drawing sometimes, cleaning my studio and thats about it. 

I remember being 10 years old and staring up at the ceiling, thinking about all the mean things kids at school would tell me sometimes, then telling myself that one day all will be better and I would feel good. Almost 10 years later now and I still cant shake that same feeling from all that time ago, and I dont know what to do anymore. If anybody has advice I would be thankfull to hear it, or if you have a better subreddit I should post this to please let me know.

,depression,"In the last 2 months my depression got so much better,my self confidence sky rocketed,I’ve been doing so much better socially,everything has felt more pleasurable,etc.
Now for the last couple of days I have been feeling extremely down,fatigued for the whole day even without doing anything, no motivation to go out, less talkative and more slow-reacting…
And I’m scared.I absolutely do not want to devolve and go back to that state.Everything was great.I went to a music festival,I made a lot of new friends,I went on vacation abroad,I used to go out everyday…So why now?Is it just tiredness?…I don’t wanna fool myself into believing that tho…
I fixed my negative thinking pattern and I know I don’t have to be perfect, and not everyday has to be perfect,but I am definitely scared of a possible relapse…I can’t let myself go through all that again…

,depression,"Perhaps because I've been hated so much, I can easily sense when someone's actions towards me are off. I think a part of me has become more sensitive after going through so much. But another part of me believes it’s right.

People often say not to stay close to those who are hated, as you might understand why they are despised. Looking around, I see many people who hate me. So, I don't bother building new relationships; I become quieter and more withdrawn.

Because I'm hated, after every meeting, after every conversation, I spend months analyzing if I said something wrong or behaved poorly. I know that sometimes, people hate me because, at times, I'm also the bad guy.

Since I'm hated, I just hope that if everyone hates me, they will just say it and leave. Don't linger in my life, making me disappointed, comparing me, treating me badly. If they hate me, they should just leave. Don't stay and hurt me until I have to be the one to leave first. Don't torment me to make my life even more miserable.

,depression,"I am a 18 years old girl. Will be 19 in next month. So here's my story -

My father never cared about me and my mother so we live in my grandpa's house. 2 years ago my mother left me because of some other men. She emotionally manipulated me to accept the relationship. I can't , it's not because I don't want her to marry anyone. It's because he is a bad guy and she is still married with my father. She blamed everyone (my uncle , my grandma and grandpa) for wasting her life. But there's no fault of them. They told her to divorce my father when I was merely 1 or 2 years old. But she didn't because of me.

On the other hand , the family I am living with they always forbid me to talk to everyone , go anywhere since my childhood. I didn't even allowed to go 1km away from my house to buy something when I was 14-15. Because of that social anxiety grew in me. And now suddenly they are pushing me to went out and talk to everyone. But why they don't understand that because of them only I am scared of people. But now they keep denying it. When I used to talk to people and go out with my friends with just 500 meters away from my house , my mother used to beat me so much. And I went there with my family's permission , but then also she did that. And not even once , she did it severe times.

I used to have friends but they all left me and some friendship broke because I changed my school. In my new school , all girls were mean to me. When they needed something they all pampering me like I was their best friend but when their work was done they were like I didn't even exist. I changed that school also for some reasons ( I took science stream because I loved that but for the things my mother did with me I was in trauma so I couldn't go forward with the stream so I changed my stream and took admission in another school) , now I am studying in an open school.

I wanted to become a film director , but my uncle and other relatives forbid me to do that. It's ok I understand their concern. Because that industry is not easy for any middle class people. But it was my childhood dream. Now I figured out that apart from that I love psychology also and I can become a psychologist. It took me 2 years to figure it out and few weeks ago I told it to my uncle. I thought he would be proud that I want to do that but he deny that also. He said I am taking decisions emotionally and I can't make money from that career and I should choose another one. Now I don't know what to do , every career I chose they rejected. I have no hope left now.

I made some online friends also during lockdown. They also left me. Few months ago also I made some friends but when I saw they gave all of our time to others I started distancing myself from them also because I can clearly say by their behavior that I was only for timepass. So I broke those friendships because I am afraid to feel that pain again , the pain when someone's heart broke. I am tired of it. But I trusted my one friend , I had many thoughts that how I will wish her on Friendship Day , but look at my fate , before friendship day comes she also left me.

Now I become a person who forgot how real smile feels like. You can say I smile all the time but not the real one. Now from past few days I can't even smile , I feel like staying alone all the time. I forgot how best friends feels like. I have exams 1 month later but I can't study a single word. Whenever I started studying my brain feels tired , I don't know what to do. I feel hopeless. I feel like I am not worthy to anything , I feel like I should be punished everytime. I used to love painting , singing , studying. These were my life but I stop loving these also. I don't found peace in anything like these which I used to do all the time.

Everytime I tried to talk with my uncle (he is raising me now because my mother left the house) about my anxiety and depression , he made me feel like that I am mistaking it as depression it's not that and I am a kid I don't know about it. 

Now I feel like I am the one who destroyed the family. If I didn't took birth everyone would be happy. My mother didn't marry that time because of me , she could marry if I hadn't been born. My uncle didn't marry anyone because of me , if I hadn't been born then he would have been happy with his wife and children. And my grandpa and grandma doesn't deserve a granddaughter like me. If my uncle and mother got married with their partners , they would have their children who would have been best. Not a girl like me.

My all friends doing best in their lives and here I am. 3 years of my life already wasted for the trauma. And now this point I am consumed by the darkness more from which I was trying to come out from 3 years. And this time it's too much , I am tired of everything and I don't even have anyone to talk with about these.",t2_ws79ydv0q,False,,0,False,I am tired of my life and everything !!

,depression,"So I’ve hit my boyfriend a good three times, but he tells people I hit him when I actually didn’t and I can’t say anything because I did before.

1st time I did it, he was mad at me and told me he was going to give our daughter a shower. 
Ok fine whatever, even though I’m usually the only one that gives her a shower.
She starts crying and I come in asking what’s wrong but instead, he pushes the door on me, trying to keep me out. 
I pushed back hard, I think he wasn’t expecting it, and I tried grabbing her but he started pushing me out the door so I started punching him and once he finally let go of her (she wasn’t anywhere near my punches he was completely blocking her from me) I grabbed her and investigated…

He got soap in her eye and wasn’t washing it off, probably thought she was being a sucky baby… 

I didn’t know what was going on he doesn’t communicate with me properly.

2nd time, he broke my cousins tv, punched a whole in my wall, and called my grandpa stupid when he told my bf he has bad anger problems, I was already reaching my breaking point with him especially since I was pregnant that time and had a one year old, he stole my wifi box during an argument because I wouldn’t let him drink, which he has a problem with.
So I put my baby in her crib and chased him and fought him because without it, I can’t phone/talk to my family, my only support.

3rd time, he stole from me again and called me a dumb bitch because I got mad at him and told him to go, I called him a bitch back and he went rushing to my room (he had everything of his) so my thought was he wanted to steal, I chased him again and he started pushing my arm away which hurt a lot because I’ve broken them before and instead of being submissive, I got angry and fought him for hurting me.

I have anger problems, I came from an abusive mother, to abusive foster home, to abusive relationship so I thought he’d be more understanding with how I deal with threats.

The thing is, he tells people I hit him and the kids, and it’s randomly, unprovoked, and says I’m abusive and mean out loud like he wants everyone to hear.

He phones people mid argument (no physical alterations) and sobs while telling them I beat him up, and if they say leave or ask if he’s on drugs, he gets mad at them and tries to be good with me.

He doesn’t work (mental health problems) and leaves me home all day and does the bare minimum when he comes home and even makes a mess when I just finished cleaning, I’m exhausted and distraught that I’m in a relationship where I feel so threatened all the time and I’m abusive, I don’t like hitting him, I know it’s wrong, and even sometimes I wish he’d hit me back… I’m depressed and hate that he’s my partner and hate the way I am.

,depression,"I've been depressed for a long time. For the past 16 years, I had no friends, little interaction with family, worked very little, no relationships, no hobbies, no travel, no exercise/sports etc etc, the usual stuff. 

The main reason for all that is my inherent desire to escape suffering. Obviously since I'm depressed, I have zero motivation to do anything. And anytime I start doing things, my anxiety kicks in really bad. 

So in order to escape from the active suffering, I've lived like a hermit, on the very little money that I manage to save after doing some work. I barely do anything everyday, even stuff that I used to enjoy.

But recently, I've decided I will actively start doing the things I hate that nevertheless allows me to pretend I'm human. I will take the advanced courses that I need for my career to progress. I will start exercising for 1-2 hours every single day. I will start forcing myself to interact more with people. I will try to make friends and start relationships. I will start engaging in hobbies and sports. I will put a lot of effort in getting a better job and actually keeping them.

All of these are things that I hate beyond words. All of them give me intense fear and disgust. But I've essentially given up on finding a solution to my problems. I've accepted that my illness will never end. But I will emulate being human anyway, because the one duty I feel I have is to make my family and friends happy. They are all very sad at my condition, but I don't want them to suffer because of me. 

I'm also doing this out of spite towards my body and mind. I hate both of them, I curse them for what they've become. So I will make them suffer like they made me suffer.  And if the suffering becomes too much for me that I do the unthinkable, then so be it. But no more of this half-existence where I neither enjoy nor suffer.

,depression,"Im not going to sugar coat it… these past weeks have been the worst weeks of my life… 

To summarize: I’ve been mentally ill these past 8 years and it has gotten worse since I got depression. 

And I got diagnoses like: anorexia, OCD, depression, social anxiety, sleep deprivation, suicidal thoughts and tendencies, self harm, nonverbal learning disorder and so on. This is because of my low self esteem since childhood and because of bullying. I feel unormal and a burden to this world because of all my illnesses and my low self esteem and confidence. 

Till today I’ve had enough. I’ve have had fucking enough. I can’t live like this anymore so I dialed 911 and talked to the emergency room as well.

I have literally no one in my life. Only my parents and they don’t understand my situation at least not properly.

I’ve lost all interest in my hobbies. 

I don’t care anymore. 

And now I’m going to a forced psychiatric ward. It’s kind of my wish, because I’m not mentally well and I need the time to heal properly. 

I just want to enjoy life again but I want to die so badly too. Uhhh…..

,depression,"Please i need your help 

I'm not sure if my therapist is bad or there's something I'm not seeing 

The last 3 sessions with my therapist have been hell

Every time I go i tell her that I've been going through hell mentally because of my depression and anxiety and all the suicidal thoughts 

But she always starts talking about the most random thing ever instead of asking about what's been happening in my life that led to all the bad stuff I've mentioned 


And i always tell her, doctor, can you please let me speak about the problems I've been going through because I'm really in pain and i want to talk, and i don't want to talk right now about things that are not that important at the moment 

And her answer is always (but every small detail matters)

And my answer is always, yes i agree , every small detail matters, but ,we can always talk about it in the next session , because right now I going through a lot and i really want to talk about it 

And then she doesn't listen to me and just tells me that I'm wrong 


And this has been happening for 2 sessions 

Before our last session 

I was going to kill myself but then i stopped, after that i texted her and i told her that I've been going through a lot and that i was suicidal 

She responded with something nice 

But then a week later when i went to see her she didn't talk about the massage i sent her or that i was going to kill myself, is like she didn't care or forgot or something 


I told her that i wasn't happy about our last sessions,but, she gave me the same answer that she always gives
 
What bothers me is that she knows that i don't have anyone to talk to in my life 

I don't have friends or anyone to talk to 

She's the only one 

And then she just ignores me and starts talking about random things

,depression,"Yesterday at 9pm, I was listening to that type of music that is relatable. It's kind of Midwestern emo. I was listening to that music because I felt like it and I just wanted to relate to something. I started feeling lonely while listening to it because of overthinking, and since I was talking to this new guy, I was like ""Wait, is he offline?"" So I went to check to see if he was offline since he still didn't reply to me, but he was online, and it made me upset because he left me on read for like 30 minutes, so I felt more lonely. I then ended up relapsing on self-harm since  I started truly loving him and it made me upset that he would leave me on read. I ended up talking to one of my online friends that I barely talk to. I vented to him about what happened, and he genuinely helped me. he gave me advice and affirmations and just helped in general. I later on told the dude I felt upset about what I did, and I got upset with him and he then said he was in the shower and whatnot, but he was online the whole time. We then resolved it somewhat, but I don't really like him that much anymore since he told me to vent to him, and I did; he didn't even help me or anything. 

I've dealt with guys in the past treating me like shit and all that. I'm tired of boys thinking they're superior to my attachment issues and shit. I'm just too broken to deal with men treating me like that now so that's why I have written some standards to show boys I see dating in the future maybe. I just want a guy to understand what I've gone through and not be dry or lame. I also don't like when guys say they're going to change just to never do so until things have gotten really bad. I just wish waiting for the one wouldn't take so long and that every guy I talk to is like a trial-and-error situation where I talk to a guy for a few weeks and they don't meet my standards so then I just talk to the next until I eventually find the one. In conclusion, I just dislike most men because of my experiences.

I have been taking sertraline for several years and have epelepsy (2x 200 mg lamotrigine) if I don't fall asleep I also take 50 mg quetiapine. I have lost my education due to my illness (as a laboratory technician in medicine)

,depression,"i feel dumb putting this on reddit. anywhere on the internet, really.

im a 19 year old trans guy, 20 in 3 days. i've not gone to college, i dont have a car, i dropped out of highschool due to extreme bullying and an abusive home life from my father, and i still live off of my family. every day i live knowing i shouldnt when i provide nothing. im a mass of flesh that people can laugh at when i make funny jokes. every day ive wished the many times i tried to kill myself as a teenager succeeded. even when i have a boyfriend, friends, and family that i at least think loves me. sometimes im not sure about the last part though. ive lost most of the family that gave a shit about me growing up.

i grew up enduring trauma every day, and i use the pit it put me in as an excuse for my shitty behavior. i dont hurt anyone. at least i havent since i was a stupid child that didnt know how to cope with it all. all i know i have correct are my morals. i avoid hurting my close ones, as its all i have to do other than rot away sitting at a computer playing games. but i do nothing else. i cant even clean right, so im scared to. every time ive tried i did something wrong. ive always done something wrong. i managed to set off a house alarm by just trying to take out the trash to prove i was useful.

i only havent attempted suicide again so i dont hurt my close ones anymore. but every day it gets really hard. i dont want to be 20 and i dread my birthday, because ive only spent every birthday with 3 people. one is dead, another doesnt talk to me much at all, and the other is in another country entirely for my birthday. i may not be alone because ill have one person, but all of the people that were ever there for me are gone. i feel awful knowing how different it will be. christmas of 2023 i at least had 2 but the one who died was missing and it wrecked me. i dont want to experience all 3 being not there. i dont want to be even older. i had to try really hard to not be at the house i normally stay at just so i wont try to hurt myself before i even get there. i dont want anyone to have to mourn someone like me. i wish they didnt care sometimes.

its easy to see what i do have and take it as ""youre lucky you have that at least"" and thats true. ive actually only had this recently. growing up, all of my friends turned out to hate me, before making awful rumors about terrible things i didnt do. or growing a strong distaste for my depression and paranoia and outbursts, which i dont blame them for. i hate it too. most of my family had issues and were never there if they didnt instead hurt me. everything i have has only been here for less than a year. im not used to feeling kindness yet. and i hate it. i want to reciprocate it, but when they say the smallest ""i love you friend"", i feel genuinely only fear because i know in the end they'll most likely leave me with some form of hatred. they always do.

i try to fix it. i want to be better. but every time i try i get knocked back down and i fall back into my pit of ""id rather be dead than happy"". its a way i get like 90% of the time. my hope only comes in short bursts.

i love my boyfriend, my mom and my friends. i miss my cat and my grandmother. i miss people that hurt me, just because i want to feel less alone. i miss so much. im trying to live in the present and love who i have now. i wish it wasnt so hard. i wish i didnt feel like i may strip away myself from them one day just because of a passing impulse. ive called so many suicide hotlines and been to 3 hospitals. ive been to therapy, and on meds. i know the only solution is myself. i hate myself. i hate myself too much to do anything for myself. if i had a clone of me standing before me and a knife in hand, i dont think id hesitate to hurt it for everything we've gone through.

its worse because theres no hope for me attractively either. the fact my boyfriend constantly says ""looks dont matter to me"" should tell you enough. im ugly, fat, have bad posture, and ridiculously out of shape. ive got nothing going for me other than the fact i hurt myself just to give to people. im nothing. a freak that shouldnt be alive. i shouldve died a long time ago.

stupid to put this on reddit, i know. im just tired of annoying my friends with my dumb thoughts and issues. i dont really care about trolls or distasteful comments anymore. my biggest hater will always be myself. ive never heard an insult that was worse than what ive called myself. and ive gotten a lot of insults.",t2_egzsjr4i,False,,0,False,this is long. i just needed to get something out there.,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1eghoay,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1722413174.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;i feel dumb putting this on reddit. anywhere on the internet, really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im a 19 year old trans guy, 20 in 3 days. i&amp;#39;ve not gone to college, i dont have a car, i dropped out of highschool due to extreme bullying and an abusive home life from my father, and i still live off of my family. every day i live knowing i shouldnt when i provide nothing. im a mass of flesh that people can laugh at when i make funny jokes. every day ive wished the many times i tried to kill myself as a teenager succeeded. even when i have a boyfriend, friends, and family that i at least think loves me. sometimes im not sure about the last part though. ive lost most of the family that gave a shit about me growing up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i grew up enduring trauma every day, and i use the pit it put me in as an excuse for my shitty behavior. i dont hurt anyone. at least i havent since i was a stupid child that didnt know how to cope with it all. all i know i have correct are my morals. i avoid hurting my close ones, as its all i have to do other than rot away sitting at a computer playing games. but i do nothing else. i cant even clean right, so im scared to. every time ive tried i did something wrong. ive always done something wrong. i managed to set off a house alarm by just trying to take out the trash to prove i was useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i only havent attempted suicide again so i dont hurt my close ones anymore. but every day it gets really hard. i dont want to be 20 and i dread my birthday, because ive only spent every birthday with 3 people. one is dead, another doesnt talk to me much at all, and the other is in another country entirely for my birthday. i may not be alone because ill have one person, but all of the people that were ever there for me are gone. i feel awful knowing how different it will be. christmas of 2023 i at least had 2 but the one who died was missing and it wrecked me. i dont want to experience all 3 being not there. i dont want to be even older. i had to try really hard to not be at the house i normally stay at just so i wont try to hurt myself before i even get there. i dont want anyone to have to mourn someone like me. i wish they didnt care sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;its easy to see what i do have and take it as &amp;quot;youre lucky you have that at least&amp;quot; and thats true. ive actually only had this recently. growing up, all of my friends turned out to hate me, before making awful rumors about terrible things i didnt do. or growing a strong distaste for my depression and paranoia and outbursts, which i dont blame them for. i hate it too. most of my family had issues and were never there if they didnt instead hurt me. everything i have has only been here for less than a year. im not used to feeling kindness yet. and i hate it. i want to reciprocate it, but when they say the smallest &amp;quot;i love you friend&amp;quot;, i feel genuinely only fear because i know in the end they&amp;#39;ll most likely leave me with some form of hatred. they always do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i try to fix it. i want to be better. but every time i try i get knocked back down and i fall back into my pit of &amp;quot;id rather be dead than happy&amp;quot;. its a way i get like 90% of the time. my hope only comes in short bursts.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I genuinely think there’s no reason to live.

When I was a kid the love from my family made me want to live and I was so happy, but then when I became a tween I realized the importance of school friends, and when I realized I didn’t have a friend group to have sleepovers with or just a group of ppl that liked me, I wanted to kill myself. 

But then I met my friend group after switching schools in 10th grade and I was in euphoria for 3 years. That’s gone now, Ive been graduated for 2 years now and i still have all my friends but now i don’t care about them like i used to because i want a girlfriend. 

But I honestly just feel like once i get a girlfriend I’ll probably be happy again a few years, but it’ll definitely just fade away again just like my family and my friends.

At this point it’s about genuinely seeing no reason to continue forward when nothing mentally stimulating ever happens to me, and when it does it just goes away eventually.

,depression,"please i really need help trying to understand. there is nobody i would ever talk about these things to so i need online anonymity.

why does it feel like no matter what NOBODY seems to want anything to do with me. I dont think people dislike me at all but nobody ever seems to want to even be friends with me. I do have a couple friends, and often times when i hang out with them they have various other friends over. many of the mutual friends i have met dozens of times, talked to dozens of times, but as soon as im not right in front of someones face im forgotten. not even worth adding on social media or anything. why?

its probably not hard to figure out i have no luck with women at all. i had a ltr for about 2 years, about 2 years ago she broke up with me. immediately afterwards i was in a “situationship” type of deal and she broke that off with me after about 3 months. those are the only two girls ive ever talked to or ever kissed. both of them were the ones to make the first move and break it off.  since then absolutely nothing. but im always told that if NO women are interested in me then i have to be doing something wrong. 

it goes without saying it is honestly painful watching essentially all of my friends and all of their friends either in relationships or getting with girls. ALL THE TIME. ALL of them. i have to watch it with a straight face. its literally just me who isnt

and this sounds stupid, but the thing that honestly makes me feel so much worse is that i know im  decent looking. im also tall, im in decent shape, i have good hygeine. i hear from people pretty often about girls thinking im cute or good looking. but i honestly hate hearing that someone thinks im cute or wtv because that seems to be the only thing people ever have to say about me. and its obviously not enough for anyone to try even talking to me.

the way i have been craving any intimacy or affection is fucking numbing. it doesnt matter how distracted i am it only takes something small to ruin my mood and make me on the verge of breaking down. every single night when i try to sleep i overthink for hours, often cry and eventually fall asleep. when i sleep most of the time when i dream its literally about girls, not even sexual lmao usually talking or affectionate stuff. its insane. its a mix of ppl i know irl or random ppl i follow on social media. it makes me feel like a fucking creep. there is no way for me to escape feeling completely unlovable and unwanted. I wake up and put on my social and happy face on and then repeat. i am so sick of feeling like this

i have been trying alot to distract myself and been following the tips to improve myself. I have been alot more engaged in my hobbies, as well as getting into new things, i have been gaining knowledge and learning new skills. i have been listening to new music, i have been buying and dressing in new clothing that i like. i have been working out and trying to be active in different ways. i genuinely really like the job that I have. i have been putting effort in to these things for close to two years now. i have noticed a difference in alot of ways in my life. i do feel happier generally, i do feel more comfortable in my own skin, while i am still pretty shy and im not super talkative, overall my anxiety has improved so much that i am surprised. why doesnt this matter? am i not good enough yet? i still havent improved myself enough yet?  i just want someone to want me. i want someone to think about me, i want to mean something to somebody. why doesnt that seem possible?

im “only” 23 but i am really having a hard time not just giving up. i feel like time is running out. people always say stuff like “the right person for you is out there”. I cant wait years just to feel some sort of intimacy with someone (which isnt even guarenteed). and even then, at my current age let alone years from now, no woman would be interested in a guy who has almost 0 experience with women. nobody would be willing and patient to teach me, and i think its totally dishonest to believe otherwise",t2_554xr62l,False,,0,False,Can someone please tell me what is wrong with me?,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1egb2t3,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,False,,1722421201.0,,[],{},,True,,1722390184.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;please i really need help trying to understand. there is nobody i would ever talk about these things to so i need online anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm in my twenties, trans, (MtF)
And that's honestly the only thing keeping me going. The only thing that brings me happiness. I look beautiful I'm told.
But beneath all that is autism, .major depressive disorder, bipolar, manic episodes, PTSD, anxiety disorder. Who knows what else at this point. I'm very young in nature. I won't go into details such as that, to try to keep some level of anonymity. But it'll become somewhat clear to you.

Im pretty dumb and naive. I ended up getting arrested and am still dealing with that and will be for awhile. They said I'd walk free, no charges, for $50k. I wish I had proof of that. But instead knowing that happened and that, being told by the judge they'd let me go if they could. I'm just now the worst I've ever been.

I can't work due to panic attacks and manic episodes, rarely eat because I'm never hungry, have gotten a drug addiction that I control, meaning. I actively can set them down for a month+ at a time and not have cravings even after binging. I can't sleep without my plushie. And I have one that goes everywhere with me. I leave my place about 2-3 times a month. I live alone. Have no friends. Never figured out how to make them, despite being a ""likeable person"". No family. I don't understand how society or the world works. It scares me, so much I hide in my place. I hate life, the whole aspect of it. I do not find joy or excitement in anything but pain. And I can't keep living in this shitty world. 

I keep trying and keep trying to end it. And I always wake up. I don't know how. Junkie friends tell me it's due to tolerance because if they did what I did. They'd be dead. And most of them are atleast 50lbs more than me. I know I need to go to a psych ward. But if they put me in with the guys, I'll become a whore (not joking sadly) and it'll mess with my mental state even more. I also don't know if they'd let me bring my plushie. And if they did. I'm scared something would happen to him or they'd take him. He's all I have. 

So, we come back to, why the fuck am invincible. Google says they are lethal combinations. I do several lethal combinations all at once. It doesn't fucking work.

I feel like I am going to hate this new place, and I'm trying so hard to look at it as a fresh start. But I'm struggling with it so much. I tell myself that if I hate it, it's only a year lease. But in other moments, a year feels like an eternity.

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I am going to hate this new place, and I&amp;#39;m trying so hard to look at it as a fresh start. But I&amp;#39;m struggling with it so much. I tell myself that if I hate it, it&amp;#39;s only a year lease. But in other moments, a year feels like an eternity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What has helped you with relocation depression in the past? I hate feeling like this.&lt;/p&gt;

Lately life became on auto pilot. No excitement. Not interesting routine. Nothing special.

I’m also suffering from migraines and the last 4-5 months been hell. Constant pain 24/7 and other migraine symptoms.

I started feeling sad before but nothing like today.

Last 1-2 months I’m constantly crying for no reason I feel like life is not worth living. I don’t want to suffer. I’m crying and anxious 
I’m having panic attack out of no where to the point that I can’t breath !

I started talking to this woman about 3 months ago. She came out of nowhere to my life. When I needed sex and love the most, I didn’t wanted her and she is completely different than me. She’s open sexually she’s done threesomes she’s Bi sexual and she’s completely what I don’t like.
But on the other hand we have good connections we talk for hours, she understands me she fills me and she’s there for me even though I’m in the worse time of my life.
I found out she’s not interested in kids the only way she would want is doing surrogate which I would never accept it. I want 3 kids and I want it the way I always dreamed it.

Ever since I found it I’ve been killing myself, I want to stop talk to her and one day I stop and I feel ok and I’m like whatever the next day I’m all obsessive and crying and her doing threesome or her doing what she do just triggers panic attack in me.


My therapist thinks it’s not her I want is what she has provided me and gave me when I needed it the most. And I got attached and I’m afraid I can’t replace her.
Idk..

Idk if this depression uses her as a trigger and I don’t want her but it’s the fact I can’t have her due to all this situation.


I just want to be strong and move on. I want to find someone who’s good for me and can fulfill my family needs and my future goals.
I want to stop being sad all of a sudden
I used to be the happiest person on earth and now I’m not.

One day I want her the second day I don’t.
It’s like when I see her she charges me than I don’t care much. 
Than she goes on vacation and I’m having panic attacks cuz she’s not her..

And people in my family know that I'm depressed, but for some reason they don't care and roam around happily in the house. This makes me so sad because my feelings are not validated. I try my best to be normal, but at the end of the day, I just can't. There is not a single day I've slept without crying in months. And once I start crying, I lose control over my mind. I throw things away, start screaming, hit myself and lock myself up in the room because I don't want anyone to see how much of a psycho I am. I've tried therapy but it didn't work for me. May be because I got used to this depressed phase and may be I want to be depressed all my life. Please give me advice on how I can be normal and how to not be bothered about anything in life.

I've not been happy at home few a years before these feelings started and I have asked for a divorce in the past but stayed for our son who has additional needs. The woman at work is on my mind constantly and last year when she dated another guy from work it was incredibly rough for me and I'm dreading when she meets the next guy.

They ask me why I'm being the way I am and as soon as I start talking about what happened back then my dad responds with "" I suffered the most i moved on why can't you "" mind you he was 35 and I was 13 at the time he doesn't understand what trauma can do to an undeveloped brain even after my therapist explained it to him. So yeah this is my story so far and why I'm here is cus I really wanna start living one day at a time, not let my perfectionist black and white thinking patterns not ruin my potential, stop emotional eating and physically undo the damage I've done in the last 13 years and also really really need advice on dealing with impulsivity.

,depression,"I'm a 20M, still lives with his loving and caring parents, have a nice paying job 100K+, have my dream car, have people that care about me, but unfortunately doesn't have the pleasure of enjoying life...

Everything that felt amazing and loved to do has become painful and joyless, making music isn't fun as it used to, doing photography has become soulless and purely uncreative compared to what it was before, talking to people and trying to know new people has become in my eyes useless and annoying.

A few years back during covid, I had started a depression that lasted for 3 years, wanted to kill myself constantly, I had some dark thoughts about taking a gun up to my mouth and just pull the trigger, or do it in a peaceful way and take pills before sleeping in hopes of never waking up again.

I have always had issues with making female relationships, I've had a few in the past but nothing that lasted more than 2-3 weeks, I have this social pressure from my friend group, every single one of them has a gf,  being asked by my colleagues at work how come at my age I don't have a gf, has severely taken a toll on me. 

Feels like the only way I start enjoying things in life, is when I put my life at risk, like driving at high speeds but even then sometimes it doesn't feel scary like it used to, playing video games is now unbearable, I play for a few minutes and then turn off my pc, talking and doing activities with my friend group is now unpleasurable.

I honestly don't know what to do, I feel like working everyday for nothing, I spend my money like crazy, hoping that the materialistic things in life would make a difference but nothing, feel happy for few hours and then get used to it, feels like an endless cycle of torture and pain for nothing.

The dark thoughts are slowly coming back to me, I feel it, as soon something bad happens, my anxiety levels sky rocket, and the thoughts of ending life start as jokes. I keep saying to people as a joke, I would love to jump off a bridge, but sometimes it feels like I actually want to do it.

Ranked top in school, attended top university, got a job at Fortune 500, climbed the ladder up fairly quickly, moved in between countries for prestigious jobs, founded a company, grew a team, had lots of friends and acquintances.

Since then, things turned different. Good things did come out of it though! I rekindled old precious friendships, took better care of my health. But for the most part, things have been pretty shit.

,depression,"everyone around me is so caught up on dumb shit, things that don't really matter to their life, everyone feels insecure and so stressed, it's like everyone has a mask on their face that's stuck with old tape and about to fall off anytime, their characters' are always about to break. their fake personalities that you can see right through.

that's why I feel like their always stressing too much on things that don't matter, like a stupid argument or a speeding ticket, everyone is ready to throw their life away, children's future, mental health, for stupid stuff that easily gets to their minds.

depression rates have increased even with kids.

also the fact that no one cares about children anymore. They are nothing but collateral damage in this absolute shit show.

,depression,"I'm not enjoying life. I have so much time to myself,  more than any person has any right to, but I don't want to use it.

I wake up depressed every morning thinking about the same stupid s***. It can take me as much as three hours to finally feel distracted enough that I can do simple chores around the home.

But then I'm back in place with nowhere to go, nothing to do, and nobody to talk to, and I wish I could just terminate my existence instantaneously.

It's way beyond the point of possibly getting better. I'm in my mid-thirties, but I'm living with the same social and emotional deficit I've had since over *twenty years ago*. My life might as well have never happened.

I'm like, decades deep into a situation where I can't make a connection with anyone. It's just too painful for me to socialize even in the most superficial ways imaginable. Every relationship I have or have had is unsalvagable as far as I'm concerned.

It's just that now, I know it'll never happen. There will never be a turn around. I knew that ten years ago and it's still the same today. I'm just too damaged from the things that I've been through.

Even if I could fix the worst parts of my life, and repair the relationships that have hurt me the most, I still have like, 20 years of depression and resentment to overcome and that's practically impossible - it's just not going to happen.

So instead of feeling good about the day and setting myself up for the future, I'd rather just see the ending now and get it over with. If my life is going nowhere as it has been, I'm tired of playing the part.

It makes me feel sad to see people much younger than me struggling here in r/depression with difficult situations, and I feel so badly for people who lose their lives without so much as a choice in the matter.

,depression,"Hi I’m not great with Reddit and I don’t really use it but I just want any advice or just something. 

Throughout my entire teens (I’m 20 now) I’ve just felt something missing from my life. I try and change something in my life because I think “that must be the problem” but it never is, I always end up here in just this pit of agony. 

I thought leaving high school would make me happy, I thought college would make me happy, I thought giving up swimming would make me happy, I thought leaving college would make me happy, I thought having a best friend would make me happy, I thought having no friends and focusing on myself would make me happy, I thought falling in love would make me happy, I thought living away from home would make me happy. Nothing. Ever. Lasts. 

I used to SH to take away this feeling but I don’t want scars all over me. I’ve thought about suicide my whole life but I’ve never attempted. I’m too afraid of failing and hurting my family and bf. 

I’m afraid I ask too much of my bf and it frustrates him because he thinks that nothing will ever be good enough for me. That he’s trying his best and I know he is. I just want someone to take away my pain, I want him to but I know it’s too much to ask. 

I feel like a worthless person just clinging onto people to make me feel something. I just don’t want to feel like this anymore and I don’t know what to do. 

I don’t have a diagnoses of anything, I’m thinking bpd or autism. But I don’t self diagnose.

,depression,"Hi, I am 37 years old, and on mid 2023, I took a sick leave from the hospitality industry, due to overwork, insults and threats from the person in charge, hard demands from customers, and I decided to prioritize my well being. It was bad to the point that I hated living, and my self esteem went way down, I was told I had imposter's syndrome. Around December, and by being with family and through counseling, I slowly started to recover.During this sick leave, I decided I wanted to change industries, and despite being scammed by a web development school who told me they would 'help me' change careers and did nothing to help me, my morale didn't go down, and it was an ok test for me.

They know I was homeless for four months and schizophrenic during that time, so they need to not hold me to the same high standards they give themselves. BTW my hygiene is decent. I don’t ever smell bad. But stuff like nails and hair get dirty because of the nature of my job.

It’s not your responsibility to criticize a mentally ill persons poor hygiene

Example 1: I got cornrows a month ago and I took them out two days ago. There were still knots and matting even after I showered. Today I FaceTimed my ex turned friend who lives far away from me and she gave me a verbal lashings because she has curly hair too and knows when the hair is starting to become dreaded and matted. I already knew my hair wasn’t looking great. I thought I’d FaceTime her before I shower, but I quickly learned that she won’t accept me unless I’m presentable to her. I’m convinced I can drop the friendship and find someone better who doesn’t verbally criticize me for 5 straight minutes about how unhygienic I am. It’s a behaviour that shows the person as completely devoid of empathy, from my perspective of a mentally ill person. The thing is my hair was clean. I just have difficulty LOOKING hygienic. I smell, feel, and am hygienic though. I went out to the nightclub the same day after taking my braids out and I was able to get girls numbers, and have a good time. No one batted an eye about my hair. I take antidepressants for depression as well as antipsychotics. ITS POSSIBLE FOR MENTALLY ILL PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH DEPRESSION TO GO OUT AND FUNCTION NORMALLY BUT STILL STRUGGLE.

Example 2: The other week my friend with benefits and I hung out on a Friday night. I slept over at her place. I didn’t wanna have sex (low libido) but she did. I didn’t come. We did it twice. I had gotten called in for a shift so I left and she said she wants to hangout right after I finish work. I went to hers and she was traumatized by the state of my nails. I’m blue collar and my nails aren’t always cut very short because I frankly don’t think about it ever. But they’re still short just not skin level. So there was some dirt. I told her it’s not as dirty as she is saying. She kept telling me I can’t finger her or go near her private parts with my nails. Obviously it was a misunderstanding because I didn’t wanna fuck her. These type of friends can leave my life and it would be perfectly fine with me because they show me they have no capacity to show me grace.

Gonna preface this by saying that im aware a lot of depressed people appreciate this, as its a well-intended gesture of looking out for someone.

For me, though....it tends to make things worse.

When im trapped in the absolute hell that is my depressed mind and chronically-in-pain body day in and day out, the last thing i need is someone asking me nearly every day ""how are you feeling?"".

Especially when they damn well know as ive made it very clear.

I finally texted something different back to a friend who does this, pretty much saying that not a loy has changed, and what would really help me is if the topic of our conversation could be focused on something thats NOT me - as im trapped in my body 24/7 and the last thing i need is to be reminded of how miserable i feel.

No motivation, not in a mood to crack a joke (unable to be more specific), blank thoughts
Even working out which was my daily pleasure and made me feel more energized and had a big brain boost doesn&amp;#39;t serve me anymore.
I had been for almost 4 years on Fluxetine and they were the best days of my life. I felt like a converastional god. My mind, plus 20IQ. Since a year now, i ve stopped it and started taking Wellbutrin. I ve lost all my charisma, my humour, my aura (as the gen Z says)
I don&amp;#39;t know who am i anymore
I ve lost myself and its killing me&lt;/p&gt;

My mom insist on doing the cooking for us, especially for my sister. She's in 12th grade. Her, I and mom only live together. But mom recently said she'd grown tired and that I need to do it. Wake up early and cook breakfast for my sister. 

My mom's reason why the sis needs to be cooked for is because she had to maintain grades. 

Now me as an unemployed introverted person had forgotten what's normal anymore. Isn't my younger sister is capable of preparing meals for herself? 

By the way, we are Asians and usually in the household, there needs to be a teamwork for someone who cooks for the overall members. But my mom has some beliefs or rules in life that are not the usual practiced in most families. This case in particular.

Also, I have a remote or freelance online work at night sometimes. I need that flexible schedule to do my own thing. Sometimes I have different eating schedule and I feel forced to do this.

Am I the AH for discussing this to my sis to not feel bad if I can't cook for her? I told her to learn to prepare for herself. I also told her I'll cook if I feel like it. I already feel exhausted in life. I can't even prep for my own. I would prefer to starve or just order online. I want to be comfortably lazy or have  freedom.

Lmfao, ok i know how ridiculously not a big deal this is but with a parent that disrupts my beliefs on what's norm, I don't know if I'm doing right. 

Also, mom has personality disorder where she doesn't trust. She don't trust the food we prep for her. For years we lived with her and she never trust her food around us. She thinks she's to be poisoned. The same with other people. She has major trust issues so yeah that's that. So she cooks her own food.

I now have a bad blood with the teacher, how should i go to the office again tomorrow? How should i deal with the toxic workplace again tomorrow?

In fact, how do i bear with those idiots? That teaching idiot who favors the other idiot who i hate so much. I hate them both.

I cried but it didn't change a thing. The heavy chest did not calm down, my disrupted peace did not mend. I feel so tired and fed up with waking up everyday just to be discarded and put down.

I don't see any reason to live now. This is not just a fight, it also tells how much of a failing crap i am and how good that other idiot is. That's why, they're both on good terms and i am the discarded one.

It's 11pm already, i just wanna die. I wanna sleep and not wakeup. I feel so so so fed up. My head is cloudy and body is aching. Nothing helps. Im so tired, no one understands.

Im a failure and that doesn't change. Never changed, wont ever change. And a life where i can be easily replaced, will be discarded again and again...idk why i should continue living in it.

I hate to admit it but I'm very rigid of a person. I can go lengths to stand on my words and to prove my ego matters more than any crap. I may not always act on my impulse but i tend to try and act.

I just cant stop imaging me jumping on a moving highway to try and get hit by the cars or trucks and die on the spot before this teacher. I also wish the guilt never stop following him like his shadow.

I want this teacher to be haunted by my lying dead body covered in blood. I just wanna prove him my ego matters by making him suffer my death. But i cant and wont becos i dont really wanna die in the end.

I just think of those becos I'm so mad and my ego is so hurt. I wish hell upon both of them. Now i just wanna be free, wanna go home. I dont wanna deal with these idiots. Im tired.

I was and am constantly thinking about it and stressing over it that i feel physically sick. My body doesnt wanna move or walk, it is almost like paralysed. I just wanna quit. Wanna leave everything behind and go far away...somewhere free from these workloads, from these idiots.

Since i cant go anywhere...i wish i died. This rant doesnt reflect 1% of the pain i feel here...the pain inside my heart. Wish i could go back to selfharming. I'm tired...freaking tired god help me.

,depression,"Greetings, people of reddit. I have a problem, and I kinda need someone's point of view in this. 

I have been nothing but a burden to my own family and friends in my 18 years of life. No matter what I do, I either I fail as a friend, or fail as a son. I've tried countless times to change but I fail each and every time. 

So, my question is: 
Should I go to a country that allows euthanasia and pay them for my own demise? Or should I keep on trying? Because at this point I am tired of life. It has been an endless circle of me trying to do better but fail time and time again. 

Now, the reason why I ask you, people of reddit, of your opinion on my situation is because I have no clue on how to live my life out. Because if you agree to me flying to a country that allows mercy k*****g then I'd gladly go for it, I'm not really someone to remember. Heck, I bet some of the people I know irl might even forget me. If you disagree with my plan, I'd gladly try again and hope I can maintain my sanity.

,depression,"Alright, so i’m a 24 year old man and i’ve been dealing with a breakup from a 10 year long relationship with my ex-fiancé. We were both high school sweethearts and celebrated our 10 year anniversary earlier this year in feb, where i proposed to her and she had said yes, i was the happiest man alive, knowing i wanted to spend the rest of my life with this woman. 

What i thought was going to be forever from then on, only turned out to be a short, less than 2 months of being engaged, and she had left me with not much explanation of why. Since then, i’ve fell into a deep depression that i haven’t been able to get out of. We stayed in contact for a few weeks, maybe a month, but i could already feel she fully let go of me and what we’d had, almost as if it was so easy and meant nothing to her. I can’t say that’s what she felt, but to me that’s how it felt. Not long after the month of talking, I noticed it was only me trying to initiate and regain what we had, initiate conversations, and then one day i got no reply… realising that i had been ghosted and forgotten. This realisation broke me fully. I’m blocked on all social media as well. 

After a decade, was this all i was worth in the end? not even a respectful message saying that we should stop contact? Idk if i’m right or wrong to feel this way, but i feel disrespected and almost worthless to the woman i’d loved with all my heart and spent a decade with, both of us growing through our teenage years and into adulthood, just to be left and forgotten so easily.. We weren’t perfect, we had ups and downs, but we’d gotten thru it all thru out the years and had gotten stronger (at least i felt) as we grew together. I just been finding it hard to get through this, i’ve deleted all photos from my phone, conversations, everything, yet she still haunts me in my dreams.

i’ve been living in another country the past 2 months as i get thru this breakup, but fr i don’t know what to do, because rn i have no job, no money and no friends so every day and night has been pretty hard mentally. I don’t know how long i’ll be able to take this if im being honest.

,depression,"Hi. I’ve been depressed most of my life, but things got especially bad the past few years - most days I could barely get out of bed. Moreover, I struggled with binge eating for a long time, which combined with a total lack of physical activity led to a pretty bad case of obesity.  
Now I’m medicated and in therapy, and feel like I finally have enough motivation to start being more productive, but sadly my body just can’t keep up. Any kind of physical activity, like a few minutes of doing chores or a slow 15 minutes walk with my dog, feel extremely hard and uncomfortable. I start feeling extremely hot, and sweat so much that my clothes get damp. It gets so bad that often I just avoid going outside altogether, as I can’t do that without feeling extreme discomfort and exhaustion.

,depression,"I am a 15y/o male from the UK who suffers from depression and suicidal thoughts. I have been a 'smart' kid since very young in primary school. The reason I am smart is due to my parents overworking me since I could read and write. It started as 30 minutes of maths every day after school, which definately helped me with maths in school, and let me have an actual challenge as I quickly found it very easy to do what my school provided. By year 6 however (around the start of when covid was appearing) it had gotten to 45 minutes of work before school and 1 hour after at a minimum in preparation for my SATs (end of primary school test in the UK). For reference, other students were doing 10-20 minutes a day maximum. Because of covid, I never did my SATs. I got into a good secondary school as a 'genius' and was the top of my class in everything. I was predicted 8s in everything (in the UK we use 1-9 as grades for GCSEs, 1 being bad and 9 being good) as it was school policy not to predict 9s. I am now in my summer holidays after year 10, going into year 11. We did our first round of mocks just before we left for the holiday and I got 5s and 6s in most subjects (I take music, computer science, history and spanish for my GCSEs), apart from maths which I got an 8 and computer science which I got a high 7. The only reason I got higher scores in maths and computer science is due to me liking the subjects and having very good teachers for them. I strongly believe that it is my parents fault that I am getting scores this low on my test due to them making me do so much school work outside of school (around 1-2 hrs now). This has also lead to me having no social life as I am at home so much doing school work. The few friends which I do have are amazing and a large part of why I am still alive today. 

I feel like my parents are trying to use me as a mini them, doing what they wished they had done when they were my age, as they think that this will help me, however it blatantly doesn't. They both didn't do enough when they were young, and ended up only just getting jobs which get the overall household income to around £80,000 for a family of 4, which is by no means poverty, but is also not anywhere near a good amount of money. I think they believe that making me do tons of work now will mean that I get a good job. I have heard them talking about me, and how they hope that they can retire early and live a rich life when they are old from my money (if I do somehow end up rich, I can tell you for a fact nothing will go to them).

The issue is furthered by my mental conditions, and my parents denial of them. I can tell you for a fact that I am a sociopath, and am very sure that I am also autistic. I have talked to both of them about it, and they have laughed it off and said that they don't have it so I can't. We live in England, and have free healthcare under the NHS, all they have to do is apply for a checkup. Literally 10 mins per. Thats it, but they can't even do that for me, yet force me to do hours of school work a day, even in holidays.

I also workout, and have for a while, leading to body dismorphia (thinking your muscles are smaller than they are) which has lead to many injuries from me working out more frequently and with more weight then I should have to try and grow them to an impossible standard my brain sets for me.

All fo these factors have lead to me not wanting to live, and considering ending it multiple times per day. As I have previously mentioned, my friends are most likely the only reason I am alive. I know they could help me get through it if I tell them, but I can't bring myself to tell them, I don't know why, I know I should but I just can't.

I know how I would (probably will) kill myself: I have rope tied under my bed which I have tied into a noose multiple times. I would grab the rope, get a bottle of bleach and a sharp knife, go down my road to a tree which I have tested the branches of and found a suitable one. I would climb to the correct branch, tie the rope into a noose around my neck and attach it to the tree. I would drink the whole thing of bleach, slit both my wrists (lengthwise), slit my throat, stab myself in the heart, and then fall off the tree to strangle myself. I know that it seems over the top, but I know that if I am going to kill myself then I want to do it, so this ensures that it will work.

I put this out there so if I do kill myself, and an investigation into it happens, this will hopefuly come out and reveal how bad my parents are.

I have been a &amp;#39;smart&amp;#39; kid since very young in primary school. The reason I am smart is due to my parents overworking me since I could read and write. It started as 30 minutes of maths every day after school, which definately helped me with maths in school, and let me have an actual challenge as I quickly found it very easy to do what my school provided. By year 6 however (around the start of when covid was appearing) it had gotten to 45 minutes of work before school and 1 hour after at a minimum in preparation for my SATs (end of primary school test in the UK). For reference, other students were doing 10-20 minutes a day maximum. Because of covid, I never did my SATs. I got into a good secondary school as a &amp;#39;genius&amp;#39; and was the top of my class in everything. I was predicted 8s in everything (in the UK we use 1-9 as grades for GCSEs, 1 being bad and 9 being good) as it was school policy not to predict 9s.

,depression,"14F, my mom was abusive whilst we grew up so I didn’t really learn hygiene.

 I only brush my tongue because my friend told me I should. When I hit puberty that’s when is got grim I will just say I was a child exploring new things but I didn’t know how to take care of myself and all my mom did was shame me , I also went through heaps of sexual trauma so that didn’t help my case

. I went through big dips of depression and my mental health was bad. And so was my hygiene 

I suffered with worm all the time and my room was a mess

My friend comes over a lot and there was times she touched and used things I did not want her to touch or use and it still haunts me 

(There was Vaseline I used that I didn’t want her to, I won’t get into it because it was embarrassing and disgusting . I told her not to but she kept asking and ended up using it anyway  so I just thought it was okay because in my head it was normal  and then I completely forgot why I didn’t want her to and kept letting her)

I feel so disgusting and nasty and I want to die . Even now I just took a shower the first proper one in ages and I still feel dirty.

How do I fix myself.

&lt;p&gt;I only brush my tongue because my friend told me I should. When I hit puberty that’s when is got grim I will just say I was a child exploring new things but I didn’t know how to take care of myself and all my mom did was shame me , I also went through heaps of sexual trauma so that didn’t help my case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;. I went through big dips of depression and my mental health was bad. And so was my hygiene &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suffered with worm all the time and my room was a mess&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My friend comes over a lot and there was times she touched and used things I did not want her to touch or use and it still haunts me &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(There was Vaseline I used that I didn’t want her to, I won’t get into it because it was embarrassing and disgusting . I told her not to but she kept asking and ended up using it anyway  so I just thought it was okay because in my head it was normal  and then I completely forgot why I didn’t want her to and kept letting her)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel so disgusting and nasty and I want to die . Even now I just took a shower the first proper one in ages and I still feel dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

I think think think… and I still do the wrong things. Is it depression when u think everybody hates u and ur not good enough? I can’t handle it when i hurt peoples feelings… I can’t handle when they tell me I did something to hurt their feelings. I feel attacked a lot.

Both dads feel like the kids just needed discipline. The first two kids have adhd. And I’ve always been told I’m too nice. They’re doing a lot of reckless things and I fear they will end up dead or in jail. Then I have a toddler… i decided to plan a pregnancy with my bf at the time.

And I have been miserable with and without him…. I regret making the baby because now the father feels like we have to keep contact.

personally dont feel it's helping. Sure it's teaching me some life skills. Supposedly. But is it really helping my metal health? 

No it's not. If anything it feels like it's making it worse. 
I hate going to therapy, I hate going to class, they took my ADHD meds away because of a heart issue and for me to focus on a fucking class is near impossible. Let alone doing any sort of homework for the class. Then I don't get it done and I'm made to feel a fool during class and forces to complete the homework in class in front of everyone. It's fucking embarrassing. I wanna tell my therapist to fuck the fuck off.

Every god damn. 3 words she has to put the word RIIIGHT? at the end of everything and it drives me absolutely fucking insane 

Why can't I just say. "" Look I'm done"" and hang the fuck up and not have to deal with these fucks anymore. 

Why do I have to make an appointment to close my case and sign 30 pieces of paper stating that I am quitting? 

I fucking hate this system. I just want out without being made to feel like the complete piece of shit that I am.

I've been suffering from moderate depression for many years, I'm not lucky in anything, no matter how hard I try, it doesn't work. I'm wounded physically and emotionally from falls, and I don't have the strength to continue.

I don't have a housing issue resolved, I would be partially happy if I bought a house and provided myself with at least a roof over my head, rather than being a tenant all my life.



Please, no super-paid jobs, etc., because I love my job as a security guard, and the fact that it is undervalued and poorly paid cannot affect that. This is a harsh reality.

I have nightmares, I scream in my sleep, from dissatisfaction in life.

How can you help? I changed 3 psychotherapists, no one could help me.

Realistically, if I won the lottery, it would definitely save me from solving my housing issue and I would at least be calm about it, because I don't have EUR 200,000 to buy a house.

And I’m not lucky and I don’t think the cards I was given set me up for a good game but I’m forced to keep playing it even though I hardly enjoy it. And I don’t even have the energy to fix my face anymore. To not look completely dead or show my anger or my sadness. Which leads to problems at work. I’ve given up on even trying to get people to like me I don’t talk to a soul. Even though I want to be liked. I feel so different. And so odd. And trapped in a life that I already know I don’t want. I wish there was a way of escape without devastating the people I love. But I rather live in misery than bring it upon them. I just wish I didn’t have to live in misery.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello everyone,

I want to share my situation and get some advice. My main language is Spanish, and I'm about to finish my senior year in the US. I was born and raised in Mexico until I was 8 years old. My family moved to the US mainly because of the poor economy in Tijuana at the time.

In Mexico, not only is it cheaper, but I can also attend a very prestigious medical school.

,depression,"Hi, this is me counting down the days of my life. i probably would be gone soon and I kinda want to tell my story to anyone who had the time to read. This is the summary of my 27 years on earth.

At the age of 5, my parents separated - mostly because of me. My father is a deadbeat truck driver who would mostly beat up my mother because there is no more sugar for his coffee. I would often witness him throwing the empty tupperware at my mom when they quarrel. I don't know if they knew though, as they would mostly leave me at the care of my maternal aunts and close our house when this happen. No one said anything. Even I, thought it was normal for them to fight. So when my mother left and went to the capital city to find work (we were living at the province that time and my mom is a teacher), I wasn't surprised. I was used to being left with my maternal aunts and basically had no close relationship with my mom back then. I was even closer to my father. 

Then, that happened. It might actually be the straw that broke the camel's back when it came to my parents' relationship. I was a mischievous child and I liked going to the water pump with my friends to bathe. It might be my bad timing, or the fact that my mom had just left, or maybe my dad was too drunk, or the fact that I was literally a child, but at that time, my father got mad with me. Like mad angry. He chased me from the water pump with his belt and layed it down on me until we reached our house. I don't remember much after that, but I remember it was a whole debacle. I was bruised all over for asking my dad for a fckin shampoo sachet. I was five.

Later, I remember my father apologizing to me. But really, what can a five year old understand from that apology? He told me it was my fault, that I was naughty, and I annoyed him to the point he raised his hands on me. And at this point, I've always been close with my father, so when he ""made me understand"" that it was my fault and ""apologized"", I really accepted that. Maybe I'm at fault. Maybe I was the problem. Maybe I deserved getting beaten because I asked him for a fckin shampoo. 

I then learned that one of my mom's cousin reported the incident to her, and the next few months were a blur. I moved with my older brother who was 8 years older than me, my mom's cousin (the one who reported the incident), and my mom's younger brother, to the capital with my mother. Then, I had a semblance of somewhat of a normal childhood, but I would still be left alone most of the time.

I understood, and I don't really blame my mother for anything. She was already trying her best to provide for us and make ends meet. I know this for a fact, and coupled with the fact that I still blamed myself for my parents' ultimate separation, I seldom asked for anything and kept everything to myself. I would mostly just do my own thing. I was often left in the care of my maternal aunts. And I was wasn't close with my brother - first of all, the age gap, second of all, I felt my brother's hostility to me. I knew he also blamed me for our parents' separation and uprooting our lives. My brother is already in highschool at that time so I don't blame him.

Then, I fell in love with writing. I fell in love with books and being able to create a world of your own where everything just falls into place. It became my outlet, my secret garden. And I apparently had a talent for that. I became an active part of the journalism club when I was in elementary and highschool. I even competed and won in writing competitions. I also became editor-in-chief of our school publication. 

I was smart. I was good with maths and science, and never had a failing grade. I had a talent with words, I was good with my hands, an artist, and even joined the school band as a drummer. Aside from these, I was even part of leadership roles in school and graduated as Vice-president of student council. These achievements carried me to the peak of my school days and also became my downfall.

I was labeled as ""that child"". You know the one with good grades and the one every teacher liked. But no one really liked me. 

I was ostracized for having a speech disability - I was born with cleft lip and palate. Out of jealousy, one of my classmate, and my ""bestfriend"" when I was in elementary scribbled a not-so-nice slur on my test paper. A test I had perfected. It turned out to be a big debacle, and I found out that my classmates never liked me. The ""friends"" I thought I have never truly appreciated and accepted me for who I am.

But I was naive. I wanted to be accepted. I started hosting elaborate sleepovers just to hangout with friends. I will often go home late at night because I'm hanging out in someone's house. I even started to force myself to people because I wanted to find somewhere I belonged. It backfired I think, because the more I wanted to be accepted, the more people rejected my company. I had this fiery and stubborn personality and I think this just added to the repulsion. 

When it finally dawned on me that these people never liked me, and kinda accepted that, it was the end of my highschool. By then, I don't have any friends. I don't have any real connections to anyone. I turned to anime, online games and social media, and actually got accepted to related communities. I actually made friends who actually liked me for who I am, and I was genuinely happy.

It was different in the real world though. The more I gained friends online, the more I lost touch with reality. My relationship with my family also worsened. Because I was labeled as ""that child"", I was often compared with my brother and my cousins. Hence, you can understand the hostility. The only ""friends"" I had were the ones which were forced by circumstances. I would often find myself forcing a relationship, but it wouldn't work out in the end, so even now, I still grieve all those wasted effort.

Because I was labeled as ""that child"", there were a lot of expectations on me when I entered college. But the thing is, I never wanted to be ""that child"". I wanted to be a normal person, not someone who apparently became ""successful"" by overcoming their disability. I don't want that kind of burden. I never wanted that kind of burden. I was not that child. I'm just me. I only wanted to be accepted somewhere. I only wanted to be accepted by someone. 

So then, I failed. I failed my classes. I got a failing grade in one of my major subject and almost failed the others. And you know what happened? I was honestly relieved. I was no longer ""that child"". But the reaction of the people around me were different. Some rejoiced and gloated at me, others, like my mom was thoroughly disappointed. And then I realized, ahhh, all this time, I was ""that child"". The irony.

All this time I had been escaping that label, and when I finally escaped, I realized that my only purpose is to be ""that child"". So, I felt useless. I felt this kind of despair that every thing I did was useless. I am useless. I'm so useless to the point that I am so powerless in proving my identity. I am not me. I am ""that child"". 

Because everything has been getting onto me, I brought up the topic of mental health with my mom and told her that I need a break from school because I might have depression. She told me that it's all just in my head, and that I'm just irresponsible for not managing my time and my life correctly. 

So, it was again my fault. I had to be that child. If not ""that child"" then who am I? So I did. I transferred at a local collage, continued my studies in something I don't like and donned the identity of ""that child"". For another 4 years, I had this mask, and I think it worked. I became ""that child"". I made new relationships and I genuinely thought I finally found somewhere I belonged. Despite for the fact that there's always this hollow feeling in my chest -- It's screaming, this is not me. I'm not ""that child"". Why do I have to do this? But if I am not ""that child"" then who am I? I finally found people who accepted ""that child"", if they knew that I'm not ""that child"", then I'll be left alone again. 

So, I silenced that voice.

And because I pretended to be ""that child"", I passed both civil service exam and my board exam on the same year I graduated. I even graduated with honors and as president of our department. Throughout my years in the leadership position, I also helped my classmates in thesis preparation, helped my underclassmen through math tutorials and actually built myself back up. Even before graduating, I was already on the running to a position at my dream job in the national government. A few days after passing the civil service exam, I got a call from my dream job and signed a contract and started that same day. Things are finally looking up to me because I became ""that child"".

Eventually, I got a permanent position and things just went downhill. It's true that the light is the brightest before it goes out. I tried so hard to be ""that child"" even in my job, and what do you know? I did excelled. I excelled so much to the point that expectations just kept piling up, responsibilities kept piling up, everything kept piling up. And I was burned out, I can only go so far with keeping up this fake identity. I dedicated everything to be excellent in what I do, but the jar is broken. No matter how much water I put it, it still leaked. 

I finally had an opportunity to consult a doctor because I had my own money now. And I was diagnosed with major depression and anxiety. Because of this the things I built crumbled and eventually my job was affected, my relationships were affected, my health was affected, and now, I'm alone again.

I have no job. I had to quit my dream job because everything is just too much. The disdain my director had for me plagues my nights, and I can't even begin with the eyes and whispers of my coworkers. They didn't take too kindly that the usual passionate and hardworking coworker had exhausted her fire.

I have no friends. I only had a relationship with people because I was ""that child"". I helped a lot of people, even connected jobs to them but no one reached out. 

I have no family. My mother wants to disown me because I'm no longer ""that child"". My brother never cared for me and remains hostile because I had always been ""that child"". My family members are hostile to me because I was ""that child"". There are a lot of underlying issues and even now, my mother blames me for not having relationship with any of her family members. They don't believe in depression, they say it's all just in your head.

Even if I want to get help with my mental health I don't have any means to support myself. I live alone and even my bills are now piling up. Everytime I open up to someone, they always just say that they had worse and that I just need to go out more, or go to church. They tell me that I am not depressed, it's all in my head. And the thing is, I'm kind of convinced at this point that this all just in my head. I'm just irresponsible, I'm just lazy, I'm just sad. 

And now, I'm honestly tired. I want to beg God for another chance in life, you know, one of those isekai tropes.

At this point, I'm just broken beyond repair. I've already been ""that child"" my whole life and built everything I had in that identity. The thing is, I'm not ""that child"", I never was. It was like a character in this game called life that I made in order to complete quests. And now that it's game over, I realized that this character is flawed. 

This is the story of ""that child"" who lived for 27 years. I feel like this is my last cry to the universe for help. People around me used to tell me that I only need to say something if I need help and they will help me. The thing is, I did. But no one listened. If there's someone out there who can genuinely help me, please, I'm desperate.

I don't have the courage to start again, but I also don't have the courage to take my own life. So, I've been starving myself. I don't harm myself outwardly because people will notice and raise questions, and honestly, I'm too tired for any confrontations. At this rate, I might die before the year ends.

I will take my life on the last day of the year, I don't know, I might not actually make it. I plan to take these last few months to prepare myself, like a countdown of sorts. I plan to finish trivial matters in the coming months so that when I eventually leave before the new year countdown, I know I had no lingering matters.

Deep down, there's a voice in me that still wanted to live. The same one I silenced a long long time ago. But that voice may just be in my head. I don't know.

I guess this is goodbye. I just want for someone to know my story that's why I'm posting here. I pray for you who had read this far, I genuinely thank you for reading my story.

This is the summary of my 27 years on earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the age of 5, my parents separated - mostly because of me. My father is a deadbeat truck driver who would mostly beat up my mother because there is no more sugar for his coffee. I would often witness him throwing the empty tupperware at my mom when they quarrel. I don&amp;#39;t know if they knew though, as they would mostly leave me at the care of my maternal aunts and close our house when this happen. No one said anything. Even I, thought it was normal for them to fight. So when my mother left and went to the capital city to find work (we were living at the province that time and my mom is a teacher), I wasn&amp;#39;t surprised. I was used to being left with my maternal aunts and basically had no close relationship with my mom back then. I was even closer to my father. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, that happened. It might actually be the straw that broke the camel&amp;#39;s back when it came to my parents&amp;#39; relationship. I was a mischievous child and I liked going to the water pump with my friends to bathe. It might be my bad timing, or the fact that my mom had just left, or maybe my dad was too drunk, or the fact that I was literally a child, but at that time, my father got mad with me. Like mad angry. He chased me from the water pump with his belt and layed it down on me until we reached our house. I don&amp;#39;t remember much after that, but I remember it was a whole debacle. I was bruised all over for asking my dad for a fckin shampoo sachet. I was five.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, I remember my father apologizing to me. But really, what can a five year old understand from that apology? He told me it was my fault, that I was naughty, and I annoyed him to the point he raised his hands on me. And at this point, I&amp;#39;ve always been close with my father, so when he &amp;quot;made me understand&amp;quot; that it was my fault and &amp;quot;apologized&amp;quot;, I really accepted that. Maybe I&amp;#39;m at fault. Maybe I was the problem. Maybe I deserved getting beaten because I asked him for a fckin shampoo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then learned that one of my mom&amp;#39;s cousin reported the incident to her, and the next few months were a blur. I moved with my older brother who was 8 years older than me, my mom&amp;#39;s cousin (the one who reported the incident), and my mom&amp;#39;s younger brother, to the capital with my mother. Then, I had a semblance of somewhat of a normal childhood, but I would still be left alone most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I understood, and I don&amp;#39;t really blame my mother for anything. She was already trying her best to provide for us and make ends meet. I know this for a fact, and coupled with the fact that I still blamed myself for my parents&amp;#39; ultimate separation, I seldom asked for anything and kept everything to myself. I would mostly just do my own thing. I was often left in the care of my maternal aunts. And I was wasn&amp;#39;t close with my brother - first of all, the age gap, second of all, I felt my brother&amp;#39;s hostility to me. I knew he also blamed me for our parents&amp;#39; separation and uprooting our lives. My brother is already in highschool at that time so I don&amp;#39;t blame him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I fell in love with writing. I fell in love with books and being able to create a world of your own where everything just falls into place. It became my outlet, my secret garden. And I apparently had a talent for that. I became an active part of the journalism club when I was in elementary and highschool. I even competed and won in writing competitions. I also became editor-in-chief of our school publication. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was smart. I was good with maths and science, and never had a failing grade. I had a talent with words, I was good with my hands, an artist, and even joined the school band as a drummer. Aside from these, I was even part of leadership roles in school and graduated as Vice-president of student council. These achievements carried me to the peak of my school days and also became my downfall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was labeled as &amp;quot;that child&amp;quot;. You know the one with good grades and the one every teacher liked. But no one really liked me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was ostracized for having a speech disability - I was born with cleft lip and palate. Out of jealousy, one of my classmate, and my &amp;quot;bestfriend&amp;quot; when I was in elementary scribbled a not-so-nice slur on my test paper. A test I had perfected. It turned out to be a big debacle, and I found out that my classmates never liked me. The &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; I thought I have never truly appreciated and accepted me for who I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I was naive. I wanted to be accepted. I started hosting elaborate sleepovers just to hangout with friends. I will often go home late at night because I&amp;#39;m hanging out in someone&amp;#39;s house. I even started to force myself to people because I wanted to find somewhere I belonged. It backfired I think, because the more I wanted to be accepted, the more people rejected my company. I had this fiery and stubborn personality and I think this just added to the repulsion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it finally dawned on me that these people never liked me, and kinda accepted that, it was the end of my highschool. By then, I don&amp;#39;t have any friends. I don&amp;#39;t have any real connections to anyone. I turned to anime, online games and social media, and actually got accepted to related communities. I actually made friends who actually liked me for who I am, and I was genuinely happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was different in the real world though. The more I gained friends online, the more I lost touch with reality. My relationship with my family also worsened. Because I was labeled as &amp;quot;that child&amp;quot;, I was often compared with my brother and my cousins. Hence, you can understand the hostility. The only &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; I had were the ones which were forced by circumstances. I would often find myself forcing a relationship, but it wouldn&amp;#39;t work out in the end, so even now, I still grieve all those wasted effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because I was labeled as &amp;quot;that child&amp;quot;, there were a lot of expectations on me when I entered college. But the thing is, I never wanted to be &amp;quot;that child&amp;quot;. I wanted to be a normal person, not someone who apparently became &amp;quot;successful&amp;quot; by overcoming their disability. I don&amp;#39;t want that kind of burden. I never wanted that kind of burden. I was not that child. I&amp;#39;m just me. I only wanted to be accepted somewhere. I only wanted to be accepted by someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So then, I failed. I failed my classes. I got a failing grade in one of my major subject and almost failed the others. And you know what happened? I was honestly relieved. I was no longer &amp;quot;that child&amp;quot;. But the reaction of the people around me were different. Some rejoiced and gloated at me, others, like my mom was thoroughly disappointed. And then I realized, ahhh, all this time, I was &amp;quot;that child&amp;quot;. The irony.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt this kind of despair that every thing I did was useless. I am useless. I&amp;#39;m so useless to the point that I am so powerless in proving my identity. I am not me. I am &amp;quot;that child&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

She told me that it&amp;#39;s all just in my head, and that I&amp;#39;m just irresponsible for not managing my time and my life correctly. &lt;/p&gt;

either im high, or im coming down from one

my mind is clouded all the time and im never sober 100% anymore.

i give into small urges because nothings stopping me

if i ask for help then people would look at me differently

i'm too much of a pussy to end my life myself. i couldnt bare to put my mum through that. but its to the point where i dont care about that even. 

but what stopping me?

im not clinically depressed. but im almost never having a sense of joy out of life. but i feel too selfish to call it depression cause ive not gone through any relatives passing or major turns to be depressed

my life just keeps getting miserable. 

social interactions hurt.
i want social interaction.

none of my friends want tk hang out, i seemed like a fool yesterday because i was begging my best friend to hang out with me at 12am, when we live 40 minutes away. 

i just needed a distraction. 

so i try hang out with my own parents yet they arent interested.

so i rot in my room. and i decide its best if i stay here. 

i have 2 best friends, and the only reason i am friends with them was because nobody wanted to be my friend for 7 months. and im forever grateful for them, but they arent the type of friends i could open up to.

ive never opened up to anyone. so i thought typing stuff here for strangers to see would be safer, to avoid being judged.

with friends or friendless, i have never had feeling of content. theres always something missing

i laugh, i cry. 

but every once in a while, i dont know, its like a realisation. my world distorts, and i feel like im living in a dream. not under the influence, but genuinely like im watching my life from a third person view. 

and a wave of sadness hits. and its not as dramatic as it sounds. but i could be loud and then i just slide myself out of the crowd. and im not that social anyway, so not much of a crowd for people to notice.

but i brush it off. until days later, where im consumed by it. i dont know what the fuck to call it. but i need advice, and what better than strangers on a channel dedicated to sadness

people care. my mum notices. but i dont want her to

i hated and still hate attention. because it takes effort. being loved takes effort. because you have to give love back, and ill feel bad if i dont. ill be selfish. but i am too tired to give love. i dont want all this attention surrounding me.

this sounds super fucking dramatic with all the full stops

i feel like im not valid because im a 15 year old girl who hasnt been through a lot in her life, i dont say that for you to say in the replies how im valid or some shit. and i dont even have a substance dependency. but then i think i do. but then i feel too selfish if i admit it

They will take credit for it though. The guys at the desk take all the glory, but when something goes wrong they instantly blame the mechanic. 

I feel like garbage when I go to work.
This career is very draining, Its physically and mentally demanding. 
My body hurts, and I just want it to end. I've had thoughts of driving my car into a wall just to end this (Just end myself) I just dont want anyone to be scarred from my actions.


 The only good thing I have going on is this lovely girl I'm talking to here on reddit. Shes very sweet, has a great personality, gorgeous and I genuinely feel happy when I talk to her. 

I know I was all over the place here but I'd appreciate any advice.

,depression,"this is going to be a long post, and i know nobody is going to see this, much less read it for that matter but idc atp

im not even supposed to be living right. im an accident, a mistake. i don't even know my own father. all i know about him is that he is/was an illegal mexican immigrant and that's it. i don't know his name, history, nothing. and to be honest, the world constantly reminds me that i serve no purpose at all, that im just some blight to be eradicated. i grew up in a poverty ridden household with a mother who was incapable of caring for me properly. fuck, i can't even remember much of these years, probably due to me repressing these awful days. i can hardly recall anything these days. anyways, because of this, my mental growth was stunted significantly. i came from a curious child to becoming timid and withdrawn. little did i know that this would become one of my critically problematic traits up until this day, but i had way more problems to worry about than that at the time. my old home was a constant battlezone of physical and mental abuse. i suppose i have gotten so used to it that i hardly even reacted to it. i was about 2-5ish at this time. i recall having a cat for one year, until she died of poisoning. i saw her die in front of my eyes. the sight of her dying is still engraved into my mind years later.

moving onto me finally going into school. i started preschool when i was about 3-4. every other student excluded me from their activities. i wanted to be friends, i wanted to forge a connection with them, i was so desperate to gain any sort of human contact outside of my family. but i was constantly excluded. i used to play by myself because the other kids didn't like me. and the one main question that still comes up every now and again came up: what's wrong with me? a concept that young me was too complex to grasp, but finally came into understanding much later. one girl, however, treated me with kindness, but im not sure if we have ever been friends at all. 

fast forward to kindergarten. this same girl came with me to kindergarten, but she made new friends and i was essential forgotten about. another student, however, did actually treat me with kindness, just like the previous girl did. but after thinking about this for some time, i think she only did this because her older brother was friends with my older brother (note: all of my siblings that i mention are my half siblings, we don't share a father). of course, she had people whom she'd prefer over me. this is an important aspect in this story that will continuously show up.

come first grade, and a new student arrives to our class. i try and make conversation with her, which, to my surprise, she actually takes interest in me. this would be the first friend that i have made in the 6 years i had been alive at the time. i used to look forward to seeing her everyday. we used to hang out on the playground all the time. she had even took an interest in making mud pies with me, which was my favorite activity to do at recess even though id create a mess on my uniform. 

this, eventually, comes to an end. me and my siblings abruptly move to my older brother's grandparents house for about six months, cutting off my one and only friendship. i had to quickly adjust to the new life that i was so suddenly thrown to. i went to a new school. frankly, it was better than my old school, it was bigger, had better teachers, i got to take a school bus to school (i lived close to my previous school, which didn't require a bus), and the playground was a vast wonderland for 7 year old me. but there was one issue: i wasn't able to click with any of the students. at all. 

after 6 months, i move back to my city into a place, that i will simply put, call an absolute living hell that i will stay in for 7 years. i swear, that place probably took years off of my life. not like i had that many years anyway, but i digress. i go back to the old school and reunite with my old friend. we go back to hanging out. meanwhile back at home, i finally meet my stepfather, who i will be referring to as satan in this story. satan made my life, as well as the rest of my siblings life an absolute shitshow. i had a good impression of him at first, but as time went on, i realized how evil this guy was. the place that i had moved to was essentially a shoebox of an apartment. hardly any space at all. this apartment was a basement that constantly flooded and had roaches, mice, flies, you name it. i have seen maggots under appliances in that place. because of the constant flooding, we had mold and mildew infiltrate the air. becaus there was hardly any space in there, my siblings had to sleep in the living room. and you can forget about air conditioning; there were no openable windows in there. satan never went outside to smoke, i used to inhale smoke all of the time when i was trying to sleep, and id wake up with my throat hurting. there was no washing machine, so we had to wash dishes on hand or walk 20 minutes to the nearest laundromat. and because of the flooding most of the clothes would smell like mildew for weeks on end. the place hardly got cleaned, and when it did it was because my mother went into a fit about how me and my siblings were dirty even though the whole house was dirty. it made no sense. she and satan used to argue almost all the time, which put a toll on my already diminishing mental state. again, more physical and mental abuse, just like the first residence i was in. i could never get the end of it. i had nowhere to go.

while all of this occurred at home, my friend invited me and another friend of her's to a sleepover. this would be my first and only sleepover to date. but when i arrived, she seemed disappointed that the other friend didn't arrive but i did. i thought nothing of it at the time but came to realize that she preferred the other friend over me. and yes, i did have a fun time, but i didn't want to go home. i really didn't want to go home. i wish i lived with my friend but, obviously, this wasn't possible. while i was gone, my siblings had messed with my stuff, going thru my things and the like. i was obviously upset but nothing was ever done about it. after the end of 2nd grade, my only friend leaves, never to return. once third grade begins is when the real downfall begins.

i don't really remember much from 3rd-5th grade other than the fact that i was bullied by basically my whole class. i was even bullied by the teachers. the main reason was for being ugly. i was practically tormented during these years. i tried talking to my parents, teachers, counselor, anybody really, but nobody came. because of this mental anguish, my grades began to take a nosedive. i became more unfocused in class as time went on. grades were the last thing on my mind due to being bullied. satan, however, didn't see this as a choice. he yelled at me, berated me, etc, all for something that i couldn't control. my mother did nothing about this, she constantly ignored me, which i think is even worse than berating. IT'S NOT MY FAULT THAT I WAS GETTING BULLIED. but no matter what, my crystal clear cries for help fell on deaf ears, every single time. my environment just caused me to completely shut down and try and seal myself away from the world.

middle school is where i got the brunt of the bullying and abuse at home. but, amid all of this bullying, is where i met my second friend. he, too, was a new student. i approached him and we became friends pretty quickly. my feelings of platonic affection for him rapidly blossomed into feelings of romantic love for him. during this time, i realized i was bisexual. but i felt wrong for liking him. i thought he could never like an ugly creature like me. me and him would always pass notes in class. i always used to draw pictures for him. even though i loved him like i never thought i could, i never confessed my feelings for him. he was my first and only crush to date. i wanted to go on so many adventures with him, i wanted him to see my feelings without me saying a word. but that never came to light, all because i was a pussy and never confessed. i always think about what we could've been if i had confessed.

then, suddenly, my life took another u-turn. me and my younger siblings were taken away by child services due to my elder brother reporting the treacherous conditions that we were living in at the shoebox. my siblings and i temporarily moved to our great aunts house. during this time, we transferred to a new school. i never got to say goodbye to my friend. 

i liked this new school, just like the other school that i went to in second grade, it's just that i wasn't able to connect with anybody. and then, covid hit. me and my siblings eventually went back to the shoebox temporarily until we found a new place. i was overjoyed that i could finally leave that terrible place behind. but, because of covid, i couldn't return back to my old school.

in 2021, i graduated middle school amidst the pandemic. i wish me and my friend had graduated together, but unfortunately that wasn't possible. this would eventually kick off the empty and most depressing days to date with me going into high school.

the new place was pretty cool, though we hardly cleaned it. old habits do tend to die hard. because we hardly cleaned that shoebox hell, we didn't clean this place either. me living at this residence was short lived, and we moved to another place nearby, which is where i currently reside. this place, too, hardly gets cleaned.

back to the school subject. i have not gained one friend since stepping into that dreached place. i hate going there. i hate attending there. at my age of 17 you would expect me to be part of a friend group or have a romantic partner, but i don't have any of those. i am basically a ghost around school. nobody pays attention to me, even though i try to make my presence known. i have cried in class multiple times without anybody batting an eye. during freshman year, i finally realized that i am a trans male, though i have never told anyone. i feel like it's too late now that i am a senior next month and the whole school essentially sees me as a girl. i hate it. it makes me want to kill myself, makes me want to erase myself from existence. which brings me to the main topic: why i want to die.



that novella that i just wrote is one of the reasons. i hate my past, i don't think i could ever recover from it. there's a ton more stuff but that is just the tip of the iceberg, as well as stuff that i can't think of at the moment.

reason #2: my siblings. specifically, my younger siblings. my siblings have destroyed everything that has and had made me happy. i used to have a fish lamp many years ago, and i recently remembered that one of my younger siblings destroyed it. i had gotten gifted a lego minecraft set for christmas one year only for my siblings to destroy that as well. my siblings have also destroyed prizes of mine. my siblings always try and push me to my limits because its ""funny"". it's actually detrimental to my health. the main culprit, however, is my youngest sister. she always finds a reason to make me yell and make me upset. she always gropes me, saying inappropriate things about me, saying my deadname out loud because ""haha funny lol XD"", moans in my ear, goes through my things, etc. i hate her. hate isn't even a strong enough word. and yes, i have told my parents, i have told my school counselor that always says to go tell my parents. there's nothing i can do about this.

reason #3: nobody cares about me. like i said earlier, i am simply a blight upon the world. people go out of their way to stay away from me. nobody really shows an interest in me. i have no special attributes. when i talk to my school counselor, she looks disinterested, like im wasting her time. remember when i said that anyone i become friends with prefers someone else? well, my friend from middle school had just recently ghosted me, which makes me friendless again :D
there goes 5 years down the drain

reason #4: im just disgusting. i didn't ask to be born into a female body, especially an ugly female body. i really wish i wasn't born at all. my conception could have easily been avoided. im sick of living as something im not. i haven't come out to my parents out of fear, but at this point idc, i don't have anything to live for anyways, or any reason to live. and yeah my younger sister doesn't know im not a girl, but it still hurts all the same when she calls me that. serves as a constant remember of someone who isn't really me.

&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;#39;t really remember much from 3rd-5th grade other than the fact that i was bullied by basically my whole class. i was even bullied by the teachers. the main reason was for being ugly. i was practically tormented during these years. i tried talking to my parents, teachers, counselor, anybody really, but nobody came. because of this mental anguish, my grades began to take a nosedive. i became more unfocused in class as time went on. grades were the last thing on my mind due to being bullied. satan, however, didn&amp;#39;t see this as a choice. he yelled at me, berated me, etc, all for something that i couldn&amp;#39;t control. my mother did nothing about this, she constantly ignored me, which i think is even worse than berating. IT&amp;#39;S NOT MY FAULT THAT I WAS GETTING BULLIED. but no matter what, my crystal clear cries for help fell on deaf ears, every single time. my environment just caused me to completely shut down and try and seal myself away from the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;middle school is where i got the brunt of the bullying and abuse at home. but, amid all of this bullying, is where i met my second friend. he, too, was a new student. i approached him and we became friends pretty quickly. my feelings of platonic affection for him rapidly blossomed into feelings of romantic love for him. during this time, i realized i was bisexual. but i felt wrong for liking him. i thought he could never like an ugly creature like me. me and him would always pass notes in class. i always used to draw pictures for him. even though i loved him like i never thought i could, i never confessed my feelings for him. he was my first and only crush to date. i wanted to go on so many adventures with him, i wanted him to see my feelings without me saying a word. but that never came to light, all because i was a pussy and never confessed. i always think about what we could&amp;#39;ve been if i had confessed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then, suddenly, my life took another u-turn. me and my younger siblings were taken away by child services due to my elder brother reporting the treacherous conditions that we were living in at the shoebox. my siblings and i temporarily moved to our great aunts house. during this time, we transferred to a new school. i never got to say goodbye to my friend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i liked this new school, just like the other school that i went to in second grade, it&amp;#39;s just that i wasn&amp;#39;t able to connect with anybody. and then, covid hit. me and my siblings eventually went back to the shoebox temporarily until we found a new place. i was overjoyed that i could finally leave that terrible place behind. but, because of covid, i couldn&amp;#39;t return back to my old school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in 2021, i graduated middle school amidst the pandemic. i wish me and my friend had graduated together, but unfortunately that wasn&amp;#39;t possible. this would eventually kick off the empty and most depressing days to date with me going into high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the new place was pretty cool, though we hardly cleaned it. old habits do tend to die hard. because we hardly cleaned that shoebox hell, we didn&amp;#39;t clean this place either. me living at this residence was short lived, and we moved to another place nearby, which is where i currently reside. this place, too, hardly gets cleaned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;back to the school subject. i have not gained one friend since stepping into that dreached place. i hate going there. i hate attending there. at my age of 17 you would expect me to be part of a friend group or have a romantic partner, but i don&amp;#39;t have any of those. i am basically a ghost around school. nobody pays attention to me, even though i try to make my presence known. i have cried in class multiple times without anybody batting an eye. during freshman year, i finally realized that i am a trans male, though i have never told anyone. i feel like it&amp;#39;s too late now that i am a senior next month and the whole school essentially sees me as a girl. i hate it. it makes me want to kill myself, makes me want to erase myself from existence. which brings me to the main topic: why i want to die.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that novella that i just wrote is one of the reasons. i hate my past, i don&amp;#39;t think i could ever recover from it. there&amp;#39;s a ton more stuff but that is just the tip of the iceberg, as well as stuff that i can&amp;#39;t think of at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reason #2: my siblings. specifically, my younger siblings. my siblings have destroyed everything that has and had made me happy. i used to have a fish lamp many years ago, and i recently remembered that one of my younger siblings destroyed it. i had gotten gifted a lego minecraft set for christmas one year only for my siblings to destroy that as well. my siblings have also destroyed prizes of mine. my siblings always try and push me to my limits because its &amp;quot;funny&amp;quot;. it&amp;#39;s actually detrimental to my health. the main culprit, however, is my youngest sister. she always finds a reason to make me yell and make me upset. she always gropes me, saying inappropriate things about me, saying my deadname out loud because &amp;quot;haha funny lol XD&amp;quot;, moans in my ear, goes through my things, etc. i hate her. hate isn&amp;#39;t even a strong enough word. and yes, i have told my parents, i have told my school counselor that always says to go tell my parents. there&amp;#39;s nothing i can do about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reason #3: nobody cares about me. like i said earlier, i am simply a blight upon the world. people go out of their way to stay away from me. nobody really shows an interest in me. i have no special attributes. when i talk to my school counselor, she looks disinterested, like im wasting her time. remember when i said that anyone i become friends with prefers someone else? well, my friend from middle school had just recently ghosted me, which makes me friendless again :D
there goes 5 years down the drain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;reason #4: im just disgusting. i didn&amp;#39;t ask to be born into a female body, especially an ugly female body. i really wish i wasn&amp;#39;t born at all. my conception could have easily been avoided. im sick of living as something im not. i haven&amp;#39;t come out to my parents out of fear, but at this point idc, i don&amp;#39;t have anything to live for anyways, or any reason to live. and yeah my younger sister doesn&amp;#39;t know im not a girl, but it still hurts all the same when she calls me that. serves as a constant remember of someone who isn&amp;#39;t really me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is a lot more that can go in this post, but im not gonna write a book about my whole life. i hope someone hits me with their truck tomorrow. and thank you, for whoever cared enough to read through this whole thing, about my stupid worthless life.&lt;/p&gt;

I do have a boyfriend but I feel like he doesn’t love me like I love him and the things he says about other women make me feel so horrible like why is he even with me? I’m so stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Today was a more taxing day than usual. Disruption at home compounded woth some realizations from self-help audio books. 


1) I was listening to ""Avoidant"" while driving around today. The book has me identified to a T, like, scary-ass today's horiscope has your full name and address level accuracy. Listening to what it is to be an avoidant-dismissive person and how one becomes this way had me relive alot of the crap I went through in my life, ticking the boxes as they were described. Then, how I damage those around me. . . Once again ticking all the boxes. All the while, not feeling all that much save for being drained. As if an hour of listening to this was the equivilant to working 4 hours out in the heat. It just struck me as one of the strangest experiences I have had in awhile.


2) Increasing fights at home with my wife. She sAyS she wants my oppinions, thoughts, and feelings.... but just like my father and step mother, they are always wrong. I hate the trap. ""What are you feeling?"" Proceed to painfully tear down walls to see what may or may not be emotions... then when I share them, ""WTF, thats stupid. You can't feel like that. Thats wrong. You are wrong."" At this point, I can't tell if I am being kicked because I AM wrong or if the alexthymia has me rattling off something truely stupid. Like someone learing a foreign language for two weeks before thier vacation.... just to sound like a complete fool to the natives. Then the surprised pikachu or feeling offended when I later turn down discussing anything. I know as a human I am 'supposed' to have emotions, they are not supposed to be easy... but I find I just emulate them now and that angers people more than just being a cold machine. I don't know if I want to be 'fixed' or 'accepted' anymore, but either way, it sapps my energy as well.


3) My flirty infatuation with The Reaper has been intensifying over the past year. Going from a bad evening here and there of, ""I'm better off gone"" to 7-10 days straight where my idle (and sometimes intrusively) I would rather be making my exit stage left. There is alot of planning and alot of almost finding peace in knowing I have an exit strategy. It doesn't bother me, but I know it is supposed to be wrong. Like the points above, this is also sapping my energy. So now I am this hisl just fumbling through things. Getting berrated around every corner by everyone, while also getting, ""why do you look so spent? Tired? Sick?"" I dunno, you try driving a car woth holes in the gas tank and see how far you get in the day to day.

I think I get attached to people very easily. I don't know. I don't know how to word this. I've texted the suicide hotline, and I grew attached to the people that texted me, I had a lot of things to say, but they didn't do much. All they did was repeat what I said back at me. They said they cared, but I know they didn't. But then I cried when our conversation ended. I wanted to talk to them more. I wanted to be someone important in their life. I hate it! I've grown attached to other people I don't know, but I don't want to tell anyone, because everything I've said so far is embarrassing enough. Also I am 14.

 I want a therapist, but I'm scared I'm going to grow too attached to them. I'm going to leave them eventually, too. They're going to forget me. I also have grown to hate therapists, I don't know why. Maybe it's because they charge a lot, and then complain when clients complain about it. Therapists pretend to care, that's literally one of the biggest parts of their job, but...I don't know. I hate them, but I also admire them.

 I don't think I want a therapist or someone else who only helps me because it's their job and they get paid, I just want someone. I don't know! I noticed a few things, I only get ""attached,"" to people who I don't know much about, work with emotional stuff, I only get attached to women, maybe it's because I don't think a man can get as emotional? Is that sexist? I feel more ok being vulnerable emotionally with a woman more than a man. 

I don't know, I think I'm just ungrateful. I think I want a mother figure, but I already have a mother. I don't talk with he much, and she annoys me a lot.

In the report it self it is completely false from everything that had happened prior to the accident itself. It stated ""i was in the left lane, didnt want to wait in traffic, switched lanes then rearended my car ending up on a hill"" I NEVER SAID THAT because i have complete memory of the events prior to that. This is a 5 lane highway. I was in the 2nd right lane from the shoulder the entire time in this accident. Prior i wanted to switch back into the middle lane (3rd lane) but I saw that traffic was moving too fast so i stayed put. I saw the right lane was empty and wanted to go there to slow down just in case if anything happened but saw the lane was fully stopped so i stayed put. There was a box truck stopped in the 1st lane with no traffic infront of him. Ok odd i thought to myself. Then a moment later the cars in the right laned swerved to the left while stopped into the 2nd lane (my lane) which resulted in the driver in front of me slamming on there brakes so i do as well. I was already giving distance and space and knew i had enough time and space to stop if needed. In a span of a second or so the car in front of me was fully stopped. AND I KNEW THE LANE TO THE RIGHT OF ME WAS CLEAR SO IN A LAST DITCH MOMENT I TRIED TO MOVE TO THE RIGHT. It wasnt enough next thing you know i hit something and im up on a hill. I was fully aware of my surroundings and Was paying full attention to what was in front of me. My story never changed from the start of to the end. I never lied or fabricated the story. Prior to being in the 2nd lane i was in the 4th lane a whiles back. But i saw they were slowing so i switched into the 3rd lane waiting for a moment then switched into the 2nd lane. I was in the 2nd lane for a good amount of time bc I had my brakes and was slowed down significantly prior to being in the 2nd lane. And saw that i was also slowing down so I gave space and saw the box truck stopped to the right in front of me. While i was in the 2nd lane i wanted to switch to the 3rd lane but couldnt becaude the speeds were too fast and i was already slowed down. The thing is whenever im in the left lane and see traffic slowing down I ALWAYS SWITCH TO THE RIGHT LANES because i dont trust people in general. I always wait before switching multiple lanes staying in the lane before switching again. How am i supposed to live with this and fight the 2 tickets unsafe lane change and carelessly driving. The report said they had statements from an off duty officer as a witness. I WAS NEVER IN THE LEFT LANE PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT... And now people are calling me a liar and that theres footage of what i Said. Ik what i said and it wasnt that i never said i was in the left lane and didnt want to wait for traffic. And i never did any unsafe lane change to begin with. The car in front of me was a white jeep cherokee which was the vehicle that overturned. The damage to my car shows that as well. It says that i rear ended but it was the right end of the car which made it flip. If i rear ended then why is the car flipped. I was driving an escalade. Idfk what to do. I judt want to give ypm i am lost. Idk what to do. I want it to end. And better yet my mental state after the accident has been shit. Even when questioned by the officer i was in distress. But i know i didnt say what the report said. I have my therapist to back me up. I NEVER FUCKING LIED OR SAID THAT EVER. Idk what to do i have a lawyer thats helping me with the ticket but with the crash report idk what to do. I dont fucking know what to do. Ik i have shit memory to begin with but when it comes to traumatizing and stressfull evens like this I have perfect memory of what happened. How are they gonna say that I lied and disnt tell the truth. HOW. My lawyer is my uncle. I dont have money to hire a new lawyer. I dont fucking know what to do. I wanna just end this already.

And saw that i was also slowing down so I gave space and saw the box truck stopped to the right in front of me. While i was in the 2nd lane i wanted to switch to the 3rd lane but couldnt becaude the speeds were too fast and i was already slowed down. The thing is whenever im in the left lane and see traffic slowing down I ALWAYS SWITCH TO THE RIGHT LANES because i dont trust people in general. I always wait before switching multiple lanes staying in the lane before switching again. How am i supposed to live with this and fight the 2 tickets unsafe lane change and carelessly driving. The report said they had statements from an off duty officer as a witness. I WAS NEVER IN THE LEFT LANE PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT... And now people are calling me a liar and that theres footage of what i Said. Ik what i said and it wasnt that i never said i was in the left lane and didnt want to wait for traffic. And i never did any unsafe lane change to begin with. The car in front of me was a white jeep cherokee which was the vehicle that overturned. The damage to my car shows that as well. It says that i rear ended but it was the right end of the car which made it flip. If i rear ended then why is the car flipped. I was driving an escalade. Idfk what to do. I judt want to give ypm i am lost. Idk what to do. I want it to end. And better yet my mental state after the accident has been shit. Even when questioned by the officer i was in distress. But i know i didnt say what the report said. I have my therapist to back me up. I NEVER FUCKING LIED OR SAID THAT EVER. Idk what to do i have a lawyer thats helping me with the ticket but with the crash report idk what to do. I dont fucking know what to do. Ik i have shit memory to begin with but when it comes to traumatizing and stressfull evens like this I have perfect memory of what happened. How are they gonna say that I lied and disnt tell the truth. HOW. My lawyer is my uncle. I dont have money to hire a new lawyer. I dont fucking know what to do. I wanna just end this already. Idkkkkk&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Damn it. I've been on a pretty good streak for a long time, I hate to feel like I'm sliding downhill again. For a bit of context...almost two years ago I was fired from the worst job I've ever had, that dragged on for 11 agonizing years. It was a blessing in disguise and it led to me finding the job I have now, which I love. The hours are great, my co-workers are awesome, and I finally have weekends off to spend with my wife. I've been riding a high from that ever since I was hired. I feel so grateful for finally finding 'my place' that it feels wrong to be depressed, but here I am.

The condensed version is: My wife and I are still living in our 'starter' home. We started out in her apartment, then moved into a duplex, and then after a really rough 4 year search, found our first house. It wasn't without it's hiccups: Of course we had a really limited budget, and then the only type of loan we qualified for that didn't require a down payment stipulated that we couldn't live within a pretty huge area. That being the case, a lot of the basic amenities we hoped for were cut off at the knees, and it seemed like we were always $10K short of being able to buy what we really wanted. We ended up in a pretty small 900 sq ft home in my home town (which I had really hoped to leave behind) in 2009.

I can't complain, it's been a great little home, and I'm extremely thankful we have it. At the same time, we had hoped to live in it for 5-10 years and then find our 'forever' home. My mother moved us around a lot when I was a kid. I was constantly being ripped free and transplanted somewhere else. As I became an adult I vowed I wouldn't live my life that way. I wanted to move as few times as possible! So when I say forever home, I literally mean the one I want to be living in when I die. 

Within the last year or so, we've begun talking about moving, and have looked at a few places. As I'm sure most are aware, the housing market is absolutely nuts right now, and has been for a while. We're in the middle of a severe shortage of affordable housing. When we found out how much we were approved for, we were excited, and thought that all the hard work was finally going to pay off. Then we started looking and found out that, just like our first home buying experience, we're just short of being able to buy something decent. The part that really kills me is, we're not looking to live in a mansion. We're extremely moderate, we'd just like something a little bigger, like 1,100-1,300 square feet. Just enough so we aren't tripping over each other. I really hate to sound entitled, but after kicking, punching, and clawing for everything we've ever had, it'd be nice to have ONE thing go our way.

Again, I feel terrible for complaining, since there are a lot of folks that don't have homes, or are struggling to buy their first house. I guess I just thought that by mid life, we might be able to see some of the fruits of our labor. Instead I feel like there's no point in continuing to look. I feel like we're going to be stuck in our cramped little house forever. Thanks for listening.

,depression,"I (F22) graduated a semester early from a university in America. This wasn’t an Ivy League university or the league under it, but it was still a private school with a good reputation. I graduated magna cum laude as a strategic communications major. You can probably guess by the name of the major that it is a liberal arts degree and my brother (M28) has told me this is a stupid and easy degree, and has emphasized it is easy to get a good GPA in this major. I don’t feel I’ve worked hard enough because of that sentiment; I don’t know how to even respond to that because I loved what I learned and I loved going to this school, even if it was expensive. 

It has always been my dream to go to law school and I applied to schools just as I was graduating. I got a 164 on my LSATs, had my 3.8 gpa, a good personal statement, internships on my resume and other things I felt were note worthy.I got a full ride from 8 schools and got waitlisted from Georgetown law (ranked 14 or at least it was when I applied)    Despite all this, I can’t help but feeling like a failure. My brother who is in finance tells me being a lawyer is stupid but this was my dream for so long. Even though I have a full ride for school, I feel stupid going in to debt to pay for my housing during this schooling. Am I even worth it. Am I smart enough to go to law school. My brother also told me the school I chose was a stupid choice. I chose the school because it was small and I liked the community it seemed to offer. However, the school is ranked around 60 nationally. I got into other higher ranked schools but I couldn’t help but choose this one because it was the best financial offer they gave me. I still feel like a moron, and this barely coherent post isn’t making me feel any better. I feel like I should just quit while I’m ahead and not go to school bc I’m not good enough and cut my losses. I wish I was Ivy League level but I’m not. I wish I was better looking. I wish I was thinner. I just wish I was better in every way. Everyone keeps telling me I should ignore my brother and that I should be proud of myself but I can’t help but feel like a failure.

,depression,"The first thing I will say is that this was never supposed to be a surprise. 
But it was never “if” this would happen, it was always “when”.
I know the pain that I am going to cause, and trust me it’s the last thing I’ll ever think about - the pain I inflicted throughout my life and the pain I will cause by doing this. 
I can’t even tell you that I tried, because you all know, deep down, that I didn’t. I’ve never tried hard in my entire life. Not even for the people I love the most. 
Coming to terms with the fact that even though I’m going to cause absolute devastation and hurt to people that I adore, it isn’t enough to stay.
Maybe that’s what I’m most sorry for. That despite how much I love you all, it wasn’t enough, to push me to try - to live. 
You didn’t do anything wrong. You tried so fucking hard and were met with tears and excuses.
Molly, you’ve been a second mum since we were kids. You constantly had to remind me to show up and do things that should’ve come naturally to me. I mean, who has to be reminded to buy their own mum a birthday card? I could apologise to you, but you’d never accept it fully, not now I’m doing this. If I told you I was at this point, you’d panic and once again try to fix things, and take responsibility for my actions. This isn’t on you. Nothing should’ve ever relied on you alone. Yet it always was. You were never supposed to bear such a responsibility - to act for both of us. Yet again, it always was. And I was never thankful. But trust me; I am now.
Mum, there’s nothing you could’ve said n c or done to prevent this. No matter how intense your love and care is, this was always on the cards. I never hugged you enough, or tell you how much comfort I felt sitting in the kitchen with you and Molly, just us and the dogs laughing. It was almost quiet in my head. But like i said - since I was a kid I knew this was how it’d go. And that’s not down to you or dad or how I was raised. And never think that for a second.
Dad, you know me almost too well, and weren’t afraid to tell me how my behaviours affected your life, and that’s the only thing I feel grateful for now. You didn’t push me over the edge, nor did your words change my outcome. The opposite is true - you have been the sole reason I’ve lived each day for 7 months and 6 days. Everyone in our family will find the irony in my death being the only thing I’ve planned in my life. This was always going to be it for me, and I’m truly sorry that I caused so much hardship. You have Covid right now as I’m typing this, and still have to take up the slack with housework and shit. What does that say about me and the person I am? I’m so faulty that killing myself seems like an easier option than change and it’s been like that since I can remember and that’s fucking embarrassing. But I think deep down you knew that. And yet you still tried, which says a lot about the good in you. 
I’m sorry to those who I didn’t mention - if I felt I had the time, I would write essays to all of you. But in my heart, the timer’s going off. 
I could write for hours to all of you, to every member of my family and the feelings I have towards you. But there’s no point. I could rattle on about how sorry I am, and how much pain I’m in. I could go on and on about how broken I am and that I’ve tried my hardest to live a good life for you all but that’s a lie. Nothing will ever be enough for me. I guess I’m too lazy to even want to live. 
And I’m too stubborn to admit, that I wanted to die in these last few months. Maybe that’s why I’ve subtly ruined my relationships with everyone, subconsciously trying to make it easier for everyone to deal with. But it’s not going to help. Nothing I say right now, is going to help. 
Fuck I don’t even care that if after all of this is over, that I’m “at peace” - I don’t even care about that. 
You should’ve all been enough for me, for anyone else, the vast amount of love I received from my family could’ve carried someone through a thousand lifetimes, except mine. 
I am sorry, and I do love you all so much. But I wasn’t supposed to be here for this long, maybe not even at all. You all deserved a better daughter, a better sister, a better granddaughter, and a better niece. 
I’m sorry that I couldn’t live for you. 
It’ll be okay somehow, someday, maybe. You were all the last thing on my mind, and your love resonates through me. But this is how it was always meant to go - I finally have the esteem to act.

 As time went on they pulled away more and more. While i still tried to hold on.  They treated me like trash while i tried everything to make them happy. All i ever did was care and want to be around them because life made so much sense again. I havent made a real friend in so long that it was amazing to have again. 

I brought this person into my circle of friends and now they are around to stay. Always present. I feel like im not allowed to come around anymore because i dont want any drama to unfold. 

All this to say..its killed me inside. I have no hope or anyone to talk too. I feel like everyday is just one bad moment from being my last day. 
I have no interest in anything. All i do is sleep. 
Today I slept 16 hours. 

Im tired of going to friends and family because i feel as though im crying wolf. They tell me advice i listen but it never gets better. I have done therapy, have medications. Done work shops and see medical professionals.  Nothing makes the pain go away.  

Why is it so hard to find a genuine friend. ?

What im getting at is..
Is there even a point to this daily anguish anymore? What do i have to gain from fighting the thoughts of suicide except one more day of pain.  To repeat the cycle again and again.

Now I'm 21 and it seems like quite literally a good majority of people I meet end up hating, bullying, or being annoyed by me at some point to the point where it affects my daily life and sometimes my health. Especially now, its so bad... 

 People on the internet especially but also co workers, I have had four co workers in counting now at my job hate my guts to the point they try to get me fired, boss me around, one even got up in my face and started a screaming match in the yard.. one kept telling me lies about the boss, now one is bossing me around and acting like I don't work when I do everything she asks of me (despite her not being my superior..) most people I've made friends with I fell off with terribly, I have a small group of close friends (4 to be exact) but otherwise most people I've been friendly with I fell off with terribly. 

 The internet is definitely the worst though..it's seriously like I am being targeted, for example I will leave a comment adding onto another post I agree with, and people who don't agree will immediately start arguing with me instead of the OP. People attack, berade, and threaten me very often. Even when I say nothing offensive, just sharing my opinion and people will make personal threats, bully me for my looks or just straight up telling me to STFU...

 I try to be nice, I am autistic so I have very poor social skills but I do everything I can to be nice and cooperative (sometimes too much so to where I am used by people) I don't judge people, definitely a people pleaser and I'd do just about anything someone I respect asked of me directly. I do like to give advice when I think it could be helpful which a lot of people seem to take offense to and I have noticed a lot of folks get especially Ped off about.. I hate saying no, I am pretty flaky and terrible at communication but it's due to extreme anxiety I can't really control 😕 I tend to mirror people as I have a very poor sense of self, so I always treat others the exact same way they treat me.

&lt;p&gt;The internet is definitely the worst though..it&amp;#39;s seriously like I am being targeted, for example I will leave a comment adding onto another post I agree with, and people who don&amp;#39;t agree will immediately start arguing with me instead of the OP. People attack, berade, and threaten me very often. Even when I say nothing offensive, just sharing my opinion and people will make personal threats, bully me for my looks or just straight up telling me to STFU...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to be nice, I am autistic so I have very poor social skills but I do everything I can to be nice and cooperative (sometimes too much so to where I am used by people) I don&amp;#39;t judge people, definitely a people pleaser and I&amp;#39;d do just about anything someone I respect asked of me directly. I do like to give advice when I think it could be helpful which a lot of people seem to take offense to and I have noticed a lot of folks get especially Ped off about.. I hate saying no, I am pretty flaky and terrible at communication but it&amp;#39;s due to extreme anxiety I can&amp;#39;t really control 😕 I tend to mirror people as I have a very poor sense of self, so I always treat others the exact same way they treat me. I just don&amp;#39;t understand what&amp;#39;s so unlikeable? Like people love to hate me almost.. I know I&amp;#39;m a little weird and emotional, but I know people who are the same exact way and still treat me like trash. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"One of the memories that have stuck with me all my life was my dad cornering himself after criticizing an event for kids with cerebral palsy and saying ""That's what you get when you have kids later in life"", which prompted me to tell him that at least those parents could not only afford healthcare and wellbeing for their kids (disabled or not) but they also took the time to know themselves and prepare as much as possible to be parents and then after realizing his mistake decided to end the conversation with ""I just wanted to have kids""

That was around 20 years ago. I was a teenager with a set mind of a childfree life (given the amount of poverty that surrounded me) and with a lot of signs pointing at my latent homosexuality. 

Now during all this time, lots have happened. Still running the longest depressive state of my life, realizing I'm autistic, contemplating that sexuality is a spectrum and one can like more than one expression at a time. AND STILL I'm stuck in that fucking moment... Imagine knowing that your child is autistic and doing nothing to prepare him for the world he's about to face. Failing your child because your ignorance and homophobia go better with the society you live in. And finally, having kids just ""because you want to""

And I'm here, defeated, desperate, wanting to leave but unable to (won't hurt myself unless I know it's for real).  I've been learning a lot about myself but seriously asking myself if it's worth trying anything here? I'm gonna die one way or another.

I&amp;#39;ve been learning a lot about myself but seriously asking myself if it&amp;#39;s worth trying anything here? I&amp;#39;m gonna die one way or another. I&amp;#39;ve become a social pariah no one wants to talk to or help or (my favorite) unwilling to sell anything to. So why improve or care? why even try? Why won&amp;#39;t they just let me go in peace? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck, I wanna go out of here so badly&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi guys,

Since I‘ve been very young (roughly 10 years old) I have struggled with the thought that there is no meaning in life, classical nihilism. 
The realisation of this „fact“ led to a what I think is a suicidal episode which did not lead to a suicide, luckily. 

Since then this thought never left me, but it didn’t led to suicidal thoughts too often. I’ve read a few philosophical ideas about the meaning of life and nihilism, for example Nietzsches life-affirming nihilism. 
Sadly I am not able to adopt this way of thinking, the „fact“ that there is no (general) meaning irritates me most of the time.  

Now here is my question: Why am I even bothered by this thought? I don’t think it is rational, neither itself - if we think about the human as a mammal who instinctively wants to survive - but not in the consequences too. Even if the premise is right I think it shouldn’t result in a wish to die, because when life has no meaning death doesn’t have it too, am I right? 
Which leads to the question, is this just a philosophical nihilism that I can’t refute or could it be that it is more like a rationalization of the nonexistence of a will to live? 

I would appreciate if any of you cold give me an answer to that.

Annotation 1: I don’t know if this is in the right subreddit, if it’s not please tell me and I will delete this post.

Annotation 2: I am not diagnosed with depression, I am currently in the process of getting into therapy to get a diagnosis and hopefully an improvement.

Annotation 3: If this post should be written in bad or weird language I want to apologise preventive. English is not my first language / I am not a native speaker.

,depression,"To keep things brief, it’s been a hell of a year, after several difficult years. 

2021 - was unemployed, got long covid, getting into debt. Diagnosed with depression and meds. 

2022 - started a new job and working with therapy on the long covid and anxiety. 

2023 - Start of year started feeling well enough to try coming off meds, stopped Fluoxetine in April. Then the job started going wrong, my boss went AWOL, I took over. Debt reached bad levels. 

2024 - moved in with my partner, house needs so much work. (On the upside, the house sale eradicated the debt). Sold house. Big birthday. Then work has went absolutely insane, 12 hour days, and it just feels like one massive thing after another now both in work and at home. 

I’m really struggling with anything that isn’t sitting down watching trash and falling asleep. I’m getting so angry so quickly over little things, like I’ve stopped being able to cope with any little thing. This triggers the anxiety that although things are good on paper, I’m not enjoying life. I achieved a lot, but feel nothing. 

For the life of me I can’t think - is this a relapse of depression (or maybe I never was really over it when I came off the meds 18 months ago?) Or is it burnout - instead of considering meds, try to get some time off work to rest and start trying to deal with things closer to home?

,depression,"Hi all,

Tough times, guys. I'm 47, two kids (one with autism), beautiful and caring wife. Since the end of December, I'm unemployed. I've been battling clinical depression for more than a decade and, now I have no more fuel to keep on going. I have tried different therapies, a shitload of drugs just to keep my head above the water.

For the last 18 years I've been working in game industry and it killed all my love for people and will to live. It ended me.

I need to provide for my family, pay for my kid medicine, pay the bills... But I can't. Two months ago I was finally diagnosed with severe case of ADHD and ODD. It was too much for me I guess. Knowing that all my life I was battling the wrong enemy, that I could have have totally different life if I only knew... It broke me - a big, athletic guy, crying like a baby.

The worst part of it is to keep the everyday mask on - laughing with my son, playing with my daughter on PC, doing dishes,  trying not to scare everyone with my 'running on fumes' attitude.

If I had no family, it would be easier to meet the Great End, but I need to crawl through life for them. Friends don't get it (go for a run or smth, I dunno I hear, or 'see the doctor'). Doctors can't help me, they just cycle the drugs; my therapist said that I'm too stubborn to change. I won't go for another therapy, I have no money since I need to support my younger one with his treatment, and the therapists that my insurance covers are just shitty.

,depression,"It was one hell of a journey. I wish you all the best.

Hi everyone. 

I'm just your average guy. 

This will probably be nothing but mish-mash. I'll get sidetracked writing this down but you should get the general gist of why I'll be heading out first.

Missed a few opportunities before I became an adult; and now the path to something I actually wanted to do is now closed. 
My ideal career did not match my creators'. I did not fight back, I did not resist. I just tried to trick myself into thinking it was what was ultimately good for me. I accepted it.
I honestly am not sure. Sure, doing what you want to do as a job may cause you to lose passion. But looking at those who became very successful in the same path, who started much younger than I did, because when I was their age, I was telling myself my creators were right and I should not pursue what I want... I don't know. Maybe they're right. I could have failed, maybe definitely failed. 
But now I live with regret. Now that path is shut, steel doors permanently locking away that road for good.

I've done nothing but rant over and over again to people I was close with. Ranting and being a negative asshole all the time, and we know that's a no-no. I've lost everyone in my life because of this. Remember, ""I'll always be here for you, in case you want to talk"" is not true. They just want to be polite. I should have respected their boundaries. I should have been less annoying. My friends began to see me as a nuisance, and now nobody talks to me anymore. 

My outer appearance is absolutely hideous. I can't look in the mirror anymore. I can't look people in the eye. I go outside with a face mask and a hat. I'm objectively disgusting. I hate every single part of me, and no, working out is not going to fix shit. You can't slap a fucking bow tie on a steaming hot pile of boar shit and say it doesn't smell bad anymore. 

I hate people. I hate everyone so much. 
Stop looking at me. Stop judging me. Stop telling me what I'm doing wrong. Stop feeling inferior to me, stop feeling anything about me when I didn't do anything to any of you fucking bastard cunts. I wish everyone somehow died simultaneously, maybe by a gigantic meteor striking the Earth, killing everyone. That would be great. I'd down a bottle of Jack Daniel's and watch as the rock gets closer and closer. 

Suppose my life is not a train wreck. Suppose everything flowed exactly how I wanted it to and now I'm living my dream. 

Would I be happy? Are you sure? I'm not sure. Maybe it could've gone better. But maybe. Maybe nothing changes. Maybe I still feel like shit. 

Fuck you all. You all try to validate yourselves; think you're better than one another, think you're cool, think you're going to be on top of everyone you know. Get the fuck out of here. Fuck you and fuck your stupid insecurities. You are the worst of the worst. Jesus Christ. Shut the fuck up.

,depression,"I’m 25M and currently living with parents in the UK - we have a good relationship and I don’t have issues in that regard. Although, I feel like I want more out of life and want to experience living on my own. I’ve been working as a freelance writer for the past 2 years, and I’m starting to find my footing on how to run my business + developed enough experience to charge higher rates.

I feel like there’s a lot of distractions at home and my parent’s aren’t really too aligned with what I’m doing, so I’m considering moving to Japan for a year to completely focus on developing my freelance business further since I visited a few months ago and loved it there.

Living at home obviously has its perks like being able to save money that I can invest into my business to grow + save a lot of time, but my mental health is getting worse here and I feel like I’m getting less done because moving out is constantly on my mind and my creativity feels limited living here. I’ve worked in other cities and it felt a lot easier for me to get things done and enjoy my work a little more.

I suffered from severe depression and anxiety attacks a few weeks ago because being in my home for so long felt like it got to me, I recovered a bit but I feel like I'm becoming unhappy again and it will start affecting me again very soon

Although, I feel like I want more out of life and want to experience living on my own. I’ve been working as a freelance writer for the past 2 years, and I’m starting to find my footing on how to run my business + developed enough experience to charge higher rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like there’s a lot of distractions at home and my parent’s aren’t really too aligned with what I’m doing, so I’m considering moving to Japan for a year to completely focus on developing my freelance business further since I visited a few months ago and loved it there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living at home obviously has its perks like being able to save money that I can invest into my business to grow + save a lot of time, but my mental health is getting worse here and I feel like I’m getting less done because moving out is constantly on my mind and my creativity feels limited living here. I’ve worked in other cities and it felt a lot easier for me to get things done and enjoy my work a little more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suffered from severe depression and anxiety attacks a few weeks ago because being in my home for so long felt like it got to me, I recovered a bit but I feel like I&amp;#39;m becoming unhappy again and it will start affecting me again very soon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roughly, I could survive on £1000 -£1500 if I lived relatively frugal in Japan, and I spend around £300-£500 per month on living expenses living at home with parents.

,depression,"Hi everyone,

I am an MSc psychology student at Goldsmiths, University of London \* , and I’m conducting a study on the relationship between depressive symptoms, self-blaming emotions (shame and guilt) and belief in free will/scientific determinism. The study consists of 3 questionnaires and will take (in total) about **15 to 20 minutes** to complete. Participants will be able to enter a prize draw to win a £100 Eurostar gift voucher \*\*  or a £100 Charity Voucher \*\*\* . You must be above the age of 18 to participate.



The study includes 8 questions regarding symptoms of depression (e.g. changes in appetite), where you have to select how frequently you’ve felt the symptom in the last 2 weeks (not at all, several days, more than half the days, nearly everyday). The other two questionnaires in the study concern belief in free will and self-blaming emotions.



The study does not ask for any personal information, and your responses will be anonymous. You can withdraw your data at any time based on an identifier you provide at the beginning of the study. Entering the prize draw is optional, and the information required for the prize draw will be processed separately.



I believe this study will have implications for the development of treatment of depression and other related mood disorders, as our worldview and emotions are deeply tied to our mental well being.



The following is the link to the study, if you wish to participate: [~https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_0vOiKs1Rpp46HNI~](https://goldpsych.eu.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0vOiKs1Rpp46HNI)



Thank you for your time!

,depression,"Hello everyone. I'm newly an adult and the last few months I've felt myself losing the motivation to do practically anything. I used to be able to write and draw and I used to have a spark for improving myself and what I enjoy but now I just feel ... nothing? That sounds so edgy but it's true. I feel apathetic towards my own life and the relationships I've built. I have to actively stop myself from self-sabotaging my relationship with my partner out of a lack of motivation to continue. I still love them, I just don't feel like I have the drive to continue everything. 

The only things I can make myself do are the things others hold me to. This is gross, and I know it, but I need to be prompted to shower by family just to get the motivation to take care of myself. It's like I've lost all drive to be a human being and it's tearing me up inside. It feels like every emotion I have just gets dulled a little while after feeling it - like if something devastating happens, I'm upset for a while but then I'm numb again. I think I'm repressing things to the point of having no motivation to change my life at all. 

I don't work. My college offers will be coming out next month but I barely even want to go to college, I'm only going because my parents want me to. I feel like a leech, and I want to stop leeching off my parents but I just don't have the motivation to do ANYTHING to change my situation. Work would make me so miserable, I desperately don't want to work, but that makes me feel like even more of a leech. 

I haven't told anyone in my life I've been feeling like this. I'm scared if I tell my partner they won't see me the same, and they're who I go to with everything. The worst part is I'm mostly worried about a breakup because it could cause issues in our friend circle that would make things like DND inconvenient, not because I actually want to uphold the relationship. I feel like such a bad person for it. I love them, but I don't think I can process my own emotions enough to actually feel the love anymore. I want to love them like they deserve to be loved, but I can't even love myself. I worry if I left the relationship, they'd hurt themself. I'm worried I would too. God everything is just so complicated, I'm so scared. Fear and apathy is all I feel when I think about my future. 

I'm tired of feeling so numb and apathetic. I want to *want* to be alive. I want to have the drive to change myself for the better. Why do I feel so useless? Is there anything I can do to help myself? I want to be a better person. I don't want to feel so numb anymore. Please help me. 

This is the first time I've ever written this dow. I've never said it out loud. This is terrifying. Please be kind. 

(I've been to school counsellors, who didn't help, and an out of school counsellor who I just couldn't connect with in any way. I can't afford private therapy. The mental health services in my country are bad if not private, so I don't believe it's an option for me. Any other help would be appreciated.

,depression,"I am a 23-M
So..4 years ago, suddenly, one day I felt a constipated stomach.. and probably mild gas. I was not so worried, and took some herbal ayurvedic medicines.. saw no result further. 

I thought I might had eat something wrong, so without thinking twice, I did started doing yoga, exercise... saw no results either. Infact, I realised there's a new symptom affecting me that is ""shortness of breathe"", and ""immediate fatigue"", it wasn't very strong earlier but later on I can feel it's severe, very severe.. I can't do mild exercise, I start breathing like a dog.. I feel so weak that even I don't feel comfortable sitting and standing, terrible body aches, headaches on regular basis, very bad thought processing, overthinking, loss of emotions, permanent numbness.. I was never like this before the symptoms started occuring one by one. 

After trying own medicines (3 months), I visited a doctor, preferable a gastroenterologist because it started with stomach constipation, I told him my symptoms, and also I realised I am panicking, being very nervous, almost losing breathe while talking, voice cracks, the doctor pointed me out ""Why you are looked scared?"" 
I felt terrible embarassment, and also a bad outcome, I noticed there's something wrong, I can't talk like I could do before.. I couldn't express myself as I used to do, I was very happy person with expressive emotions before this.. 
Later on later on, I kept visiting the same doctor, but he gave suggestions like ""it's s normal IBS, and you can do dieting, walking, etc."" and proceeded with giving me some medicines, it was maybe to reduce gas and increase digestion, lol. 
It didn't work, kept trying to visit, same result.. changed doctor, told them problems, no result, kept visiting more doctrs, no good result... 
At this point, I was very fed up.. I thought I will be cured forever, I will regain my mental and physical ability, I could be ok again, have a good guts.. but no, it increased more and more, I realised my mind is no more under control, it got very bad... Terrible thoughts, bad sleep, insomnia, overthinking, over sleeping, weak, fear of conversation, fear of college, very strange body jerks, sudden cramps etc. 

I felt more depressed, my mind couldnt let me make decisions, I couldn't think, it was like just blank thoughts.. I couldn't focus on studies, I couldn't think for my future... I couldnt talk to my mom and dad normally, they point out that my voice is becoming depressing, and I also look very sad, shocked, terribly depressed. 

I want help! If you guys what I've been suffering from, I want to live a good life.. it's terrible to be here, I swear.. I can't even go for a job interview, i get terrible shaking and voice crack even thinking of it.. i tried once and twice and I felt embarassed, I was shaking... 

Some of the tests I got done by doctors:
•Urine test (very normal)
•Stool test (very normal, but used to see small eggs in stool at the starting age of these symptoms.. i never got to know what was that)
•Ultrasound (little 0.4mm stone in kidney + hydro nephrosis + few gas shadows) 
•Colonscopy (mild hemmaroids, proctitis)
•Blood test (very very very low vitamin B12, D, some liver infection too, doctor said.. and took so much medicines, injections for it, it might have been normal now, I think.. or maybe not, I didn't visit doctor anymore , believing I wouldn't get cured) 


Symptoms I currently have, and it's severe:

•Restless body, restless legs, feel like I want to continuously stretch every body part, but still it doesn't make change)

So..4 years ago, suddenly, one day I felt a constipated stomach.. and probably mild gas. I was not so worried, and took some herbal ayurvedic medicines.. saw no result further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought I might had eat something wrong, so without thinking twice, I did started doing yoga, exercise... saw no results either. Infact, I realised there&amp;#39;s a new symptom affecting me that is &amp;quot;shortness of breathe&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;immediate fatigue&amp;quot;, it wasn&amp;#39;t very strong earlier but later on I can feel it&amp;#39;s severe, very severe.. I can&amp;#39;t do mild exercise, I start breathing like a dog.. I feel so weak that even I don&amp;#39;t feel comfortable sitting and standing, terrible body aches, headaches on regular basis, very bad thought processing, overthinking, loss of emotions, permanent numbness.. I was never like this before the symptoms started occuring one by one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying own medicines (3 months), I visited a doctor, preferable a gastroenterologist because it started with stomach constipation, I told him my symptoms, and also I realised I am panicking, being very nervous, almost losing breathe while talking, voice cracks, the doctor pointed me out &amp;quot;Why you are looked scared?&amp;quot; 
I felt terrible embarassment, and also a bad outcome, I noticed there&amp;#39;s something wrong, I can&amp;#39;t talk like I could do before.. I couldn&amp;#39;t express myself as I used to do, I was very happy person with expressive emotions before this.. 
Later on later on, I kept visiting the same doctor, but he gave suggestions like &amp;quot;it&amp;#39;s s normal IBS, and you can do dieting, walking, etc.&amp;quot; and proceeded with giving me some medicines, it was maybe to reduce gas and increase digestion, lol. 
It didn&amp;#39;t work, kept trying to visit, same result.. changed doctor, told them problems, no result, kept visiting more doctrs, no good result... 
At this point, I was very fed up.. I thought I will be cured forever, I will regain my mental and physical ability, I could be ok again, have a good guts.. but no, it increased more and more, I realised my mind is no more under control, it got very bad... Terrible thoughts, bad sleep, insomnia, overthinking, over sleeping, weak, fear of conversation, fear of college, very strange body jerks, sudden cramps etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt more depressed, my mind couldnt let me make decisions, I couldn&amp;#39;t think, it was like just blank thoughts.. I couldn&amp;#39;t focus on studies, I couldn&amp;#39;t think for my future... I couldnt talk to my mom and dad normally, they point out that my voice is becoming depressing, and I also look very sad, shocked, terribly depressed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want help! If you guys what I&amp;#39;ve been suffering from, I want to live a good life.. it&amp;#39;s terrible to be here, I swear.. I can&amp;#39;t even go for a job interview, i get terrible shaking and voice crack even thinking of it.. i tried once and twice and I felt embarassed, I was shaking... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the tests I got done by doctors:
•Urine test (very normal)
•Stool test (very normal, but used to see small eggs in stool at the starting age of these symptoms.. i never got to know what was that)
•Ultrasound (little 0.4mm stone in kidney + hydro nephrosis + few gas shadows) 
•Colonscopy (mild hemmaroids, proctitis)
•Blood test (very very very low vitamin B12, D, some liver infection too, doctor said.. and took so much medicines, injections for it, it might have been normal now, I think.. or maybe not, I didn&amp;#39;t visit doctor anymore , believing I wouldn&amp;#39;t get cured) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Symptoms I currently have, and it&amp;#39;s severe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•Restless body, restless legs, feel like I want to continuously stretch every body part, but still it doesn&amp;#39;t make change)&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hey
First of all I HATE TO COMPLAIN. Life is a gift I’m blessed to have what I have. I’m blessed to be where I am and I’m blessed to live another day in this earth.

I’m suffering from migraines every time I have a big cycle that lasts 4-7 months I’m going insane..

No point in life my mood constantly changes. I’m angry I’m sad I’m happy repeat.
Im in constant pain.

I always remain positive and I never believed in depression. I always thought bad thought ? F it I’ll think positive eventually it’ll go away. And it did once in the past.

Things going good I guess? I’m stuck in this routine I had 0 vacation for over a year I live in the states alone without my family I immigrated here and things can get lonely. No serious relationship also.

I started having this bad thoughts about 3-4 months ago. I’d feel lonely and sad but Itll go away pretty quick. And I won’t feel it much.

Than I met this girl. Oh boy.
She’s not my type and on day one I rejected her. She’s completely different than me. She’s b sexual she can’t physically have kids which is my absolute dream. She also never wanted which doesn’t bother her.
She’s very openly about sex and having there some in relationship which I do not believe in. She’s also love drugs and things I don’t like. 
But in the other way we have this connection we talk hours and have great connection.

Ever since she entered my life I’m in a EDGE! Constant paranoid attacks, anxiety. I would think if I should give it a go even with everything I mentioned and the fact she can’t have kids or if I shouldn’t..

I know I don’t love her because she’s not my type but I’m also very attracted to her.
She’s there for me always even when I tell her I don’t want to talk she’ll be there waiting . Lately we fight every single day. Decided to let this go and only be friends but still I can’t do it. 

I was never obsessed or attached. My friends used to tell me they wish I’ll fall in love already.
This girl changed me but it almost feels like it’s not her. It’s the void she feels, the loneliness she covering…

She’s out of the country and I’m totally losing it .

I wake up depressed I go to sleep depressed it’s not her something is missing from my life and I can’t tell what 
From being the happiest person in the last 3 years I became the saddest…

I read all day about depression and how to get through it.
I try to work out to go to friends
I want to be out and I want to do things but I’m also limited with friends.

I used to be happy just going to the gym and now going to the gym is a nightmare but I still do.

I feel like my brain is imbalanced my chemicals are not working right. 
Sometime I’ll feel happy and back to normal and I’ll be like so who cares from her and why didn’t I even cried 
Some days I cry for no reason…


Can I go through this? Any tips? I want to enjoy love again I want to be happy to fall in love again to met new women travel work I don’t want to.

&lt;p&gt;I always remain positive and I never believed in depression. I always thought bad thought ? F it I’ll think positive eventually it’ll go away. And it did once in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things going good I guess? I’m stuck in this routine I had 0 vacation for over a year I live in the states alone without my family I immigrated here and things can get lonely. No serious relationship also.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started having this bad thoughts about 3-4 months ago. I’d feel lonely and sad but Itll go away pretty quick. And I won’t feel it much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Than I met this girl. Oh boy.
She’s not my type and on day one I rejected her. She’s completely different than me. She’s b sexual she can’t physically have kids which is my absolute dream. She also never wanted which doesn’t bother her.
She’s very openly about sex and having there some in relationship which I do not believe in. She’s also love drugs and things I don’t like. 
But in the other way we have this connection we talk hours and have great connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since she entered my life I’m in a EDGE! Constant paranoid attacks, anxiety. I would think if I should give it a go even with everything I mentioned and the fact she can’t have kids or if I shouldn’t..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I don’t love her because she’s not my type but I’m also very attracted to her.
She’s there for me always even when I tell her I don’t want to talk she’ll be there waiting . Lately we fight every single day. Decided to let this go and only be friends but still I can’t do it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never obsessed or attached. My friends used to tell me they wish I’ll fall in love already.
This girl changed me but it almost feels like it’s not her. It’s the void she feels, the loneliness she covering…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She’s out of the country and I’m totally losing it .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wake up depressed I go to sleep depressed it’s not her something is missing from my life and I can’t tell what 
From being the happiest person in the last 3 years I became the saddest…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read all day about depression and how to get through it.
I try to work out to go to friends
I want to be out and I want to do things but I’m also limited with friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to be happy just going to the gym and now going to the gym is a nightmare but I still do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like my brain is imbalanced my chemicals are not working right. 
Sometime I’ll feel happy and back to normal and I’ll be like so who cares from her and why didn’t I even cried 
Some days I cry for no reason…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can I go through this? Any tips? I want to enjoy love again I want to be happy to fall in love again to met new women travel work I don’t want to. Stuck in this obsession&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Long story kinda short: was on a low dose benzodiazepine and LOW dose Zoloft for 22 years. Did fairly well. Was motivated, enjoyed many activities but not all. Had some partial erectile dysfunction a couple of years ago and went off the Zoloft (it was only 20mg/day, over that and my nervousness got out of hand and was 24/7). Felt fine for about 8 months off it (still was on the benzo), then I started to notice a blah feeling, flat, things were not as enjoyable. That slowly worsened in the winter until I had a real depressive episode. Tried tryptophan, it was a mixed bag and gave me some autonomic issues and some insomnia. Then tried to get on the zoloft again, and even a low dose was horrible the 2nd time around. Heart issues, postural tachycardia that was bad in the mornings, insomnia worsened, blood pressure went up significantly. So I quit the zoloft again. 

I tried some different supplements (a slow tapering off on the benzo to this day), and felt fairly good for a couple of months. Now it seems like every time I try a supplement that ""works"" it helps for a month or two and then I'm back to my same flat, unenjoyable state. I sometimes even get brief thoughts of why is life worth living if I can't enjoy it. It seems like I simply cannot appreciate what I have for some reason. It's all there in front of me but I can't enjoy it or be content with it. 

The supplements that originally helped were 1000mg/day Niacinamide, then 650mg/day Betaine/Trimetylglycine. Now I'm popping 25mg straight Niacin sometimes, and that boosts mood quickly but it's temporary. I don't want to get a tolerance for it and start taking it like 6 times a day, but maybe I'll have to in order to keep my mood at a certain level. On the flip side, I'm 1/2 done tapering off the benzodiazepine and am doing fairly well with that, better than I thought.

,depression,"hey all so i’m (20f) and about two weeks ago my mom (55f) made a trip about halfway across the country to “scout out” a small town where she wants to move to in the coming years for her retirement

at the moment i live with her in a 800ish square foot apartment nearly a 14 hour drive away from where she visited, and when she came back after 5 days she sat me down and asked how i would feel about moving with my boyfriend (20m) into the apartment we share (we have lived here almost 6 years, my name has not been on the lease due to my own struggles during high school, i graduated 3 years late and i have never had a job so have not been able to be put on the lease to pay rent)

so since she has been back ive been putting in job applications like crazy (20-30 a day) and am working towards getting my drivers license so that i will be “all set” in her words for when she leaves. at first, she wanted to start the process in the next 1-2 years, which turned into about a year, which is now probably going to be not even a year. 

i have never been away from my mom like this in my life, i know it probably sounds incredibly childish and stupid but the thought of her moving away permanently and possibly for the rest of her life makes me incredibly sad and overwhelmed. i know i probably just need to suck it up and do my best to get a job but at the same time i feel so sad and overwhelmed and like i have no idea what to do",t2_3t2xc8ou,False,,0,False,feels like things are moving way too fast (rant),[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1ef9wck,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1722284831.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;hey all so i’m (20f) and about two weeks ago my mom (55f) made a trip about halfway across the country to “scout out” a small town where she wants to move to in the coming years for her retirement&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I am a fifteen year old girl and this is my first post after lurking for some time now; I really need help with my binge eating.

I've been doing this since November 2023, starting off as wanting to lose a few pounds for a nice event, and fast, so I resorted to completely water fasting for days at a time; and stuck to ED twitter to motivate myself (I suspect that's what caused me to be so intense in the first place.. It romanticized starving heavily.)

Long story short, I lost the ten pounds in 3 weeks (mostly water weight), then quickly gained back around fifteen in the weeks after the event. I felt so guilty, and fast forward another few months, I kept going in the binge-restrict cycle, but gaining more than I lost.    
  
I either was fainting from now five-day water fasts, or passing out from week-long bingeing until I nearly threw up. Then eating again when I felt the tiniest pang of 'hunger'.

Around Febuary, I reach my highest weight I've been in a while, 141 lbs. (I'm 5'4) I feel miserable, and starting the new semester of 9th, I decide to starve again; and it finally works, bringing me down to 135, then quickly to 129.   






By 129, my friend tells me the guy (my age) I had a crush on last semester actually likes me, and him and I start talking, quickly going for a date (walk + music) together.   
  
It was so sweet, and innocent, and I felt happier than I did in a long time; plus this was the first time I had ever had someone interested in me, so I was elated; I really, \*really\* liked him.   
  
We even had opened up about our weight issues, he told me about how he had to deal with intensely counting calories and training for his wrestling, and with how he spoke about it (and how he looked; muscular for a boy our age), I could tell he was very disciplined. 

I (and I regret this, it was too insecure, even for me) told him about my issues and how I thought I looked really fat/chubby, and he looked at me in shock and said something against it (I don't remember), and said he thought I was very pretty. 

I still have a hard time believing this, I'm relatively 'thick', I guess it's called, but I am very, very ugly when I'm not wearing makeup. I can't even bear to look at myself in the mirror without it. But thankfully, I look around a five or six with it on.   
  
Meanwhile this boy is a solid ten, and has dated other 'ten' girls in our grade, all of whom were skinnier than me (and extremely skinny, actually) and looked perfect with minimal makeup.

A few days later, he dumps me. And on Valentines day. He didn't tell me why, said it was 'for the better', and I suspect it may have been that one insecure comment I made (though I was confident for the rest of our conversations), along with how strict his parents were.   
  
Anyways, without this closure, I got into a depressed state again (it never feels bad enough to be called a 'depression'), and ruined all my progress from 127 lbs, by then, to 141. My new highest weight. It was higher than the one I had even started at back in November, 135, and even in Febuary.   
  
The day I saw that weight, something changed, on March 11. I decided, I would start again. To be healthy. Except I was still practically starving myself, just \*willingly\* eating a four-digit amount of calories, then (1100-1150), instead of doing it on a binge. 

On top of that, I worked out for two hours a day, every day (even on weekends), and did 10k steps at least, and drank 6L of water a day, at least. 

And I finally made it! I had gotten to 123 lbs. I hadn't been that light since November, when I had starved myself, and gotten to 120.6 lbs. Everything felt good, surprisingly. I was happy, I had been eating good, healthy foods, I had been doing better in school, I had mended my relationships with my friends, and could even look at myself, all of me, in the mirror (even bare faced, I had lost enough face fat to like how I looked there, too!), and appreciate my body.  


  
  
Until I got the strongest binge urge, on April 27, and caved in.   
  
Tons of chocolate, fruits, bread, spreads, treats, ice cream; I even mixed a cup of flour with sugar and butter, to make my own 'cookie dough', and had it \*again\*, when it wasn't enough. 

I was so bloated and pained that I think I had gotten sick, just from that, and stayed home for the next few days. Those days, I kept on bingeing. All day, even while I did my school work. I would have the highest calorie things like pecans with honey, cheese; but the worst was the time I even polished off a Kirkland 1kg (I think) tub of peanut butter. Start to finish. Mixed with jams and honey. 

I was so miserable, but held up, for the last few months. I tried to convince myself that I \*could\* do it, 'bounce back' as they say, but I only kept growing bigger; getting depressed again from the unhealthy food, and even more depressed and stressed about how the guy I had liked now percieved me. 

I had bet he thought I was the biggest pig ever, especially after I had told him I was going on a cut, all the way back in Febuary, but now was eating so much and always bloated and puffy. 



  
  
Fast forward again. It's the end of exams, the last day of school. I see my weight is 145 lbs. An all-time high; even worse than in grade 8, when I was a pretty big girl. Now, I completely lost it, went on a 700 calorie 'diet', re-installed Twitter for the EDtwt content to 'trigger' (motivate me). 

But, I failed pretty soon, and kept trying again until I got sick of it, though I went down to around 135 lbs. Now, I'm balancing 135-140, depending on the day. 





I still feel so ugly and horrendous. I look in the mirror and all I see is my fat and acne-covered, scar-covered (I relapsed, after two years, in my SH in May, after my first few binges since 123 lbs.) I hate myself, I hate my life, I can't see any good in my life, and I feel like I will never be loved, because of how thick I am, unless it's for something sexual; as all the other girls my age with my body type are getting attention for. I can't watch the animes I love, because I feel like the characters would judge me, in real life. Same goes with my favorite songs, and movies. I can't even read my favorite books as I used to, because I very often enjoy self-inserting, but I know that the characters I admire would all think I am too chubby. 

All I can do to cope is go on forums like these and eat, eat, eat until I pass out and can dream about a better life, where I'm skinny and someone loves me how I wanted that guy to love me. Thankfully, I did quit twitter, and still haven't re-joined.   
  
I guess this is all just a rambling vent-ish thing. But I desperately need help. I feel like my one chance to get skinny and better was in March, but I messed it up forever by bingeing in April, and ever since. I need better advice than ""drink water, eat veggies, brush teeth"", IT HAS NEVER WORKED. I have tried it, countless times. We can't afford therapy, and my nutritionist doesn't help at all. Whenever I try to explain to her or my family that this binging makes me miserable, they all are just like ""well, it's good you're eating.""   
  
Nobody cares. They keep buying junk. I'm too young to leave, too busy with school-related stuff to get a job to fund an exit, even. I have no one close enough to talk to about this. I have journalled for hours at a time and it's never helped. I feel hopeless.  
  
I just need help. I am at the end of my wits, or however it's said. I am writing this as I just finished a family-sized box of nuts and raisins, the first time in a bit; just another binge in this stupid fucking summer. I was supposed to be 85 lbs by now. Instead, I'm 137 (I can only guess, I'm on vacation).

,depression,"I'm a 17 years old boy, born in Japan and raised in Brazil. My family including me are awkwardly super inept, misunderstood or missing timing of things to say, pretty much in the Asian family portraits/stereotype. It has been really tough to deal with myself unawareness and unconsciousness facing convos being socially anxious, totally blanking out, shaking my hands or moving too much my body not being able to fully look at the others eyes. I have been founding myself in deplorable situations through my life. Such as in primary school, other kids really enjoyed tricking me or doing wrong things and blaming me for what they had done, making me the one in the Manager's room. Even if I were not involved in that. Or elementary school, in which I had a lot of ""friends"", thus making me feel more comfortable and free, landing me to take bad decisions. Such as when I was playing with a ball alone, a guy just came and kicked the ball far away to make me run for the ball and I simply decided to kick his ass. Ending up with me receiving his knees in my inner pants parts and being blamed by everyone. The guy that harmed me in the down parts wasn't blamed for anything. And In high school where I'm currently in, I was claimed as racist for saying that prejudicing yellow people is also considered racist, everyone including the teacher called me racist for that reason. Because racism is only applied to black people and xenophobia for yellow people. And I didn't know that, but I also wanted to try convincing or explaining why it's also considered racism. By using historical facts that MIGHT reasonate in some way. Continuing in high school, this time I decided to not make friends and isolating myself. I was in a moment of completely change and decided then so. But changing myself by myself was a completely mistake. Not being auto sufficient to self development and getting fulfill overwhelmed by pressure and stress due the course I'm doing, automation. Started to feel insomnia not getting to fall as sleep properly, sleeping only 1 to 4 hours a day, pretty much making me lose control of myself and awareness. Since I am too tired to think or even read properly, I can be totally compared to a drunk if analyzing my capability to think due the preveusly told things. 
 I have been always trying to explain everythings, always feeling the necessity to write essays explaining and apologising. Or talking non stop about something bad I have said or done and trying to recovering the lost. Perhaps in hope to be understood by the other. And having my apologies overall accepted by the others that I have a affection to. Because I want to be their friends, but they no longer wants to be friends with me. 
 I always try to point my own mistakes to other people, and it probably give them the impression I'm victumising myself. My mom victumises herself a lot and I don't want to blame her for something I could just not be, I'm still thinking she perhaps influenced me. Being barely my only reference (my dad left me to my mom and I've never met him). People hates when someone starts to point there own mistakes, overthinking and I feel that so have I. Sometimes depending on my ""mood"" I act completely the opposite of everything said before and just so sudden people starts to like me. But who already know me by the main side, regardless refuses to give me a chance or anything. I don't know if it's a diseases, but probably it isn't (I was thinking it could be bipolarity, since my nickname at elementary school was bipolar). I have been trying to improve a way to approach people being completely honest about barely 50% in 10 about anything (around the 4 in 10 cases being truly honest about something) which haven't been working well... Being honest most of the time isn't very attractive for the people. Or being truly honest only in appropriated moments have been working well, but not essentially. I'm probably not skilled enough to do any good improvement. Although, I can develop convos about barely anything, which is sorta contradictory. If I can talk about barely anything how can I not develop it. 
 It has been roughly 3 years of pain and falling apart. Not being able to make a self statement or being comprehended by anyone. I think my life had not being so hard since I got into primary school. Being sexually harassed by the school's manager at 10 in front of everyone at school, some teachers got mad at the manager. But nothing happened to him. I don't know if everything what I said can form a understandable statement or a completely falacia. 
 During the pandemic and high school period certainly was the periods which I started feeling more depressed and emotional (I was 13 at the beginning of the pandemic), due to again my family pressure and general changes that the body naturally develops during that period (adolescence). Sometimes I feel like I wanted to hit my head against something or break everything. I'm losing the interests all my interests I had before and not getting new ones. Everyday that passes through it feels worse. I used to go to therapy but I decided to quit due to not making me feel better and it wasn't the truly me there.

,depression,"I'm in my 30's and since I was 26-27 I started to feel empty. I have always been accomplished in most things I have done, so a lot of people will say ""oh but there's not reason for you to feel like that"", etc. I had a fairly good childhood, supporting family, never been through any out of the ordinary trauma. Studied an engineering degree, I have been sucessful in my jobs, I have been lucky enough to travel the world as one of my passions, learned languages, created meaningful connections with people, you name it. 

Last year this emptiness started to become even worse and I think I tried to compensate by having excesses: traveling way too much, going out with friends almost everyday, endulging in wine 3-4 times a week, taking for granted my 7yr relationship with my partner (who I love with all my heart). Although I did put plenty of effort into the relationship as well, all of this took a toll in the relationship itself and ended up in a breakup. And since then all that emptiness I was already feeling became a lot lot worse, combined with the sense of loss and grieving. I was already going to therapy and since the breakup I decided to take the process more seriously, started on meds provided by a psychiatrist, group therapy, talking to people around me I considered might be of help. I have tried to take on old hobbies, find new ones and all the typical advise in this situation. 

But still, that emptiness still there and now I miss my ex like crazy.  And months into therapy, meds and trying everything I can think of, I'm now feeling tired and some days even passively suicidal. I don't have any desire to leave my room or interact with people, just wishing one of these mornings I don't wake up. I feel utterly miserable. I try to keep telling myself that this is temporary and to hold on to the thought of happy moments that will probably never come back.

I have always been accomplished in most things I have done, so a lot of people will say &amp;quot;oh but there&amp;#39;s not reason for you to feel like that&amp;quot;, etc. I had a fairly good childhood, supporting family, never been through any out of the ordinary trauma. Studied an engineering degree, I have been sucessful in my jobs, I have been lucky enough to travel the world as one of my passions, learned languages, created meaningful connections with people, you name it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year this emptiness started to become even worse and I think I tried to compensate by having excesses: traveling way too much, going out with friends almost everyday, endulging in wine 3-4 times a week, taking for granted my 7yr relationship with my partner (who I love with all my heart). Although I did put plenty of effort into the relationship as well, all of this took a toll in the relationship itself and ended up in a breakup. And since then all that emptiness I was already feeling became a lot lot worse, combined with the sense of loss and grieving. I was already going to therapy and since the breakup I decided to take the process more seriously, started on meds provided by a psychiatrist, group therapy, talking to people around me I considered might be of help. I have tried to take on old hobbies, find new ones and all the typical advise in this situation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But still, that emptiness still there and now I miss my ex like crazy.  And months into therapy, meds and trying everything I can think of, I&amp;#39;m now feeling tired and some days even passively suicidal. I don&amp;#39;t have any desire to leave my room or interact with people, just wishing one of these mornings I don&amp;#39;t wake up. I feel utterly miserable. I try to keep telling myself that this is temporary and to hold on to the thought of happy moments that will probably never come back. On the few occasions when those passive-suicidal thoughts turn into more active thoughts, the only thing that keeps me from moving forward with those is avoiding my mom such terrible pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to make this emptiness stop and the emotional pain that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;

I had some not so nice ""frienships"" during my first terms and most of them just used the relationship to get all of the university material from me and...well, I guess I was just ""the student, who can give you this and that when you need it"".

,depression,"I'd like to apologize in advance as this post is just me wallowing in self-pity.

I don't know how to start this. I can't focus, I mess things up, talking to me probably feels like talking to a wall. 

I hate myself for even thinking at one point that the whole world against me, when I don't. I hate myself even more that some people don't seem to think that way. I'm too quiet, too passive, can't stand up for myself. 

I hate myself for keeping bottling my feelings and keeping things to myself. I don't know how to act when being comforted and I don't know what to do when comforting someone. 
I'm a bad daughter for not providing comfort to my mother who obviously just cried. It hurts me that my brother knows that she had always cried ever since dad died and this is the first time I see it.
I'm a bad sister for being sa choosy, lazy and spoiled.
I'm a bad friend for thinking the worst about my only friends. For crying and going to them during a emotional breakdown when they probably have it worse and not expecting that out of me. And I'm scared that they don't want to go to me when their the ones having a bad day. 

I hate the feeling of a day where everything is just normal, then somehow my heart start to feel heavy, or when I overthink and think of the worst case scenario only for it to be completely go alright. 

Last crying/breakdown session I had was a month ago, and it was all because I couldn't find an object that was going to be important for school later on. I feel bad for bringing jt up to my mother. Proving time and time again that I'm so out of my head and not aware of my sorroundings. I'm careless. I had sh myself over losing a thing, and now I have done it again simply because I can't stand to go back to school tomorrow. 

I suffer under so much pressure and deprecation that I have put on myself. How do I even explain that to people. Oh yes I hate myself so much because of what my brain thinks about myself and I have a completely normal life whatsoever. Never been abused or bullied, can you believe that?

I just can't. Some days I feel like I'm just whining. Sure I might be crying now, but tomorrow I know I'll be alright and I might fool myself that I am actually fine, what if what I'm worrying about right now was never a problem in the first place. despite all that self-awareness, I would still repeat the cycle of feeling absolutely the worst to ""oh wait things are actuallt quite nice""

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know how to start this. I can&amp;#39;t focus, I mess things up, talking to me probably feels like talking to a wall. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself for even thinking at one point that the whole world against me, when I don&amp;#39;t. I hate myself even more that some people don&amp;#39;t seem to think that way. I&amp;#39;m too quiet, too passive, can&amp;#39;t stand up for myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself for keeping bottling my feelings and keeping things to myself. I don&amp;#39;t know how to act when being comforted and I don&amp;#39;t know what to do when comforting someone. 
I&amp;#39;m a bad daughter for not providing comfort to my mother who obviously just cried. It hurts me that my brother knows that she had always cried ever since dad died and this is the first time I see it.
I&amp;#39;m a bad sister for being sa choosy, lazy and spoiled.
I&amp;#39;m a bad friend for thinking the worst about my only friends. For crying and going to them during a emotional breakdown when they probably have it worse and not expecting that out of me. And I&amp;#39;m scared that they don&amp;#39;t want to go to me when their the ones having a bad day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate the feeling of a day where everything is just normal, then somehow my heart start to feel heavy, or when I overthink and think of the worst case scenario only for it to be completely go alright. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last crying/breakdown session I had was a month ago, and it was all because I couldn&amp;#39;t find an object that was going to be important for school later on. I feel bad for bringing jt up to my mother. Proving time and time again that I&amp;#39;m so out of my head and not aware of my sorroundings. I&amp;#39;m careless. I had sh myself over losing a thing, and now I have done it again simply because I can&amp;#39;t stand to go back to school tomorrow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suffer under so much pressure and deprecation that I have put on myself. How do I even explain that to people. Oh yes I hate myself so much because of what my brain thinks about myself and I have a completely normal life whatsoever. Never been abused or bullied, can you believe that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just can&amp;#39;t. Some days I feel like I&amp;#39;m just whining. Sure I might be crying now, but tomorrow I know I&amp;#39;ll be alright and I might fool myself that I am actually fine, what if what I&amp;#39;m worrying about right now was never a problem in the first place. despite all that self-awareness, I would still repeat the cycle of feeling absolutely the worst to &amp;quot;oh wait things are actuallt quite nice&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

The displays seemed at first to be a product of mental disability, depression coupled with a form of autism but I've come to the conclusion that there's an aspect of silent envy to this problem. My roommate has told me he has ptsd and for the first two years I lived here he seems to for the most part mind his own space and business and would watch TV in his living room. But slowly over time has developed this strange behavior where he now stays and lurks in his room all day with his door open in silence right across from my room so he can hear everything I'm doing. At first I thought he was just getting some peace and quiet. But then I realized as it became more apparent when he would literally do it consistently for the entire day and night and react to anything I did, if i left the house, had someone over etc. Then he started doing this weird shit where would somehow know whent I go to bed and he would go to bed at the same exact time as me every single night and wake up the same time in the morning. This made me uncomfortable because its suggesting he literally is such a weirdo that he lurks in his room and just listens to what im doing all day. He'll time things perfectly to act like he's doing something like walk into the kitchen at 2 am right I've turned my light off and got on my bed and lurk and stand next to my door in the dark to the point where I've thrown shit at the door and alled him names like wtf are you doing I can hear you fat moron! I've also caught him several times standing in the dark behind his door late at night waiting for me to come out of my room to go to the bathroom. I've called him out on his retarded behaviour and told him he better learn to stop it or I'm going to wind up in prison in day for taking a router router drill to his eardrums. Which isn't me I don't want to and have never hurt anyone but this person has made my life miserable to the point I'm borderline psychotic.its like their entire existence is out of silently lurking envy of my existence. And they are so depressed and retarded they can't understand themselves to help it so there's nothing I can say or do to change it and I think that fat sloth demon knows that shit! So he continues doing what he does lurking and eavesdropping on my business and life making me feel uncomfortable everyday because that's all he can do.

In short, I was in college for tv/film and working at a coffee shop in 2022.

So at the end of the year, when I was done with MLM nonsense, come to find out I am barred from coming back to the school because my grades were so low and I was out for over two semesters. 

So back to sales jobs. The following year I sold phones, got fired, worked at a theater summer camp I used to be a student at, they didn’t keep me on board after the summer.

,depression,"hello haha i never imagined myself downloading reddit and even posting something here but here I am. Idk how this works. I don't even know if people would notice my post but here's my story (bare with me bcs hindi ako marunong magkwento)

Incoming fourth year college na sana ako, but there's this one prof from last sem which really frustrated the whole class and the other section. He's known sa paghihingi ng money in disguise as a donation daw kapalit ng grades.I was on his good side, ako yung minemessage sa mga classes namin last sem and kung may mga tanong siya. One night, during summer break na 'to around 9pm, he asked for my whereabouts and even called na hindi ko sinagot due to uncomfort kasi nga late na. I politely replied parin and then he told me about a class meeting daw sa isang park malayo sa school. The place and time of the meeting is inconvenient sa commuters kasi wala ng mga dorm dahil nga summer break. I forwarded the message on our class gc and I jokingly labeled him ""gagi, pisti, and kalamri"".

Someone snitched me and sent my message to him and he threatened to press charges. I kept on asking apology to him but he insists na magkakaso siya and ipapa-expel ako and there's a possibility daw na makareceive ako ng warrant. I was so anxious that I couldn't eat and sleep. I've been harming myself na rin which was my usual coping mechanism 

 I met him ulit and handed him my personal apology letter kasama ang ilang classmates but then, sa korte na daw ako magpaliwanag. Before ending that meeting, he told me to meet him alone and I did out of so much fear. On that meeting, he asked me to give him 10,000 which he claimed to be the lawyers fee daw na ibinayad niya, if maibalik ko daw yun, he will ask his lawyer to file a motion to wash the case. He doesn't want me to let my parents know about it and not even my closest friends.

I am not really good at handing situations and feeling ko, walang solution sa problem ko.

,depression,"I’ve always had nihilistic and rational beliefs and views on life or world in general. It just seemed more logical to me to believe that nothing has to make sense. It just exists, life is not fair or unfair, it’s just the mind perceiving it. The good and bad do not exist unless one’s mind perceives it and judges.

However since I’ve swallowed the blackpill it has opened a big hole in my soul that it’s getting progressively worse. Everything is greyish. I cannot see the beauty in life anymore. I’ve lost all the appetite. Been starving for 3 days now. Sleep is the one time I feel good because my mind is too tired to process anything so it’s like I stop existing for a short amount of time until I wake up with an extreme feeling of sadness and numbness, wishing it was just a dream. But it’s reality. 

I realised that I’m very emotional even though I try to hide and convince myself that I use logic, what I said above on the nihilistic views aren’t helping anymore. They’re making me worse. And I believe that hope is the one thing that keeps one alive.

A man with no hope is a man dead. It all makes sense. Hope is the only thing that keeps man content. Hope to start a business one day so you can have financial freedom, hope to pursue a college degree to have a career. Hope to improve yourself to feel fulfilled and more attractive. Hope to find someone and have a family, not die alone.

It’s hope, the only thing that keeps humans not go insane like me or other people going through similar experiences. Unless you are a monk of course or a very small percentage of people. I understand and believe that happiness is a state of mind but unfortunately I am just someone with traumas, anxieties and depression, I cannot become a monk or just press a button and become happy. 

I will always compare myself to other people and feel inferior. This feeling of inferiority and the massive fear of rejection has caused me to isolate myself and feel miserable.

My mother tells me to be grateful because you are physically healthy and there’s people whose days are counting. Sure this is a solid and wise point to view. I never said I am not grateful for my health, but is it really living if now I see everything black and white?  

I’ve always had social anxiety and terrible low self esteem ever since puberty hit me, which I haven’t done anything to help me but ignore, since my mother isn’t someone who considers mental health important. 

The terrible social anxiety I’ve had has caused me to be so lonely and introverted that I never approached anyone or talk to someone, which led me to absolute loneliness. I am someone very humble but very anxious to the point I’ve questioned if I’m autistic or is it really just social anxiety. 

We’re human beings. It’s in our DNA to want to socialize and have people around.

Now that I’ve discovered the so called blackpill theory I’ve gotten devastated and absolutely crushed to the point I see no reason in wanting to improve myself and try to approach people. I’ve never been called as unattractive or ugly, instead I may have gotten compliments here and there. I am someone who is very analytical and introspective. I may be awkward sometimes due to my anxiety but once someone gives me a chance to talk and get comfortable I can talk about anything.


TL;DR: I am a male in his early twenties who has always been insecure and socially anxious to talk to anyone or approach people with massive fear of rejection, which has now led to total isolation. Recently I have discovered the blackpill theory which states that looks is the most important factor in how people view you and your confidence. So not only was I insecure and shy before, but now I am absolutely crushed since I have to worry about not being a tall handsome model-looking male to go outside and meet people. I want to be social. I want a group of friends, a relationship too. If I was socially anxious to go out and talk to people or find people before,  now I’m absolutely hopeless and see no point in anything.

Any answer and opinion on how can I improve and change my view on the world is appreciated.

",t2_14w03838yo,False,,0,False,Social anxiety &amp; depression. How do you cope if all hope is lost? TL;DR at the end of the post.,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1eeyxn5,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1722258085.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had nihilistic and rational beliefs and views on life or world in general. It just seemed more logical to me to believe that nothing has to make sense. It just exists, life is not fair or unfair, it’s just the mind perceiving it. The good and bad do not exist unless one’s mind perceives it and judges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However since I’ve swallowed the blackpill it has opened a big hole in my soul that it’s getting progressively worse. Everything is greyish. I cannot see the beauty in life anymore. I’ve lost all the appetite. Been starving for 3 days now. Sleep is the one time I feel good because my mind is too tired to process anything so it’s like I stop existing for a short amount of time until I wake up with an extreme feeling of sadness and numbness, wishing it was just a dream. But it’s reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised that I’m very emotional even though I try to hide and convince myself that I use logic, what I said above on the nihilistic views aren’t helping anymore. They’re making me worse. And I believe that hope is the one thing that keeps one alive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A man with no hope is a man dead. It all makes sense. Hope is the only thing that keeps man content. Hope to start a business one day so you can have financial freedom, hope to pursue a college degree to have a career. Hope to improve yourself to feel fulfilled and more attractive. Hope to find someone and have a family, not die alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hope, the only thing that keeps humans not go insane like me or other people going through similar experiences. Unless you are a monk of course or a very small percentage of people. I understand and believe that happiness is a state of mind but unfortunately I am just someone with traumas, anxieties and depression, I cannot become a monk or just press a button and become happy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will always compare myself to other people and feel inferior. This feeling of inferiority and the massive fear of rejection has caused me to isolate myself and feel miserable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother tells me to be grateful because you are physically healthy and there’s people whose days are counting. Sure this is a solid and wise point to view. I never said I am not grateful for my health, but is it really living if now I see everything black and white?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had social anxiety and terrible low self esteem ever since puberty hit me, which I haven’t done anything to help me but ignore, since my mother isn’t someone who considers mental health important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The terrible social anxiety I’ve had has caused me to be so lonely and introverted that I never approached anyone or talk to someone, which led me to absolute loneliness. I am someone very humble but very anxious to the point I’ve questioned if I’m autistic or is it really just social anxiety. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re human beings. It’s in our DNA to want to socialize and have people around.&lt;/p&gt;

I know this is stupid and pathetic, but nobody is reading this anyways, and if they did it won't change, it never does.

A hug would be really nice though I'm sure, Imagining it just makes me feel worse though, I shouldn't think too much more about it, it's not something meant for me...

,depression,"I don't get why stories like Stranger Things or IT are so popular because I really can't relate to those characters.

,depression,"I have always been a sad child. My father hit me as a child brutally- Wooden rulers, metal rods, belts.. you name it. I was also sexually abused as a child by multiple people. I was fat-shamed and went to a catholic school where teachers constantly slut-shamed me.

Then my parents sent me off to a boarding school and apart from harbouring feelings for a super straight girl, time there was nice. So, about this girl, she would constantly pull me close and push me away. Times when she would be with me the entire day and then disappear without explanation. I would cry and cry and cry and feel helpless.

Then I went to university, and started feeling deeply inadequate about everything- my looks, my skills, my personality- everything. The first semester went by like this. 

Then, the pandemic happened and something In me clicked. I bought a foodscale, a weighing machine and started working out like 5 hours a day. Eating like 500 calories a day. Obviously, I lost weight, but I'd developed an eating disorder by then. All I thought about was my body and I couldn't stand to look in the mirror. Whatever I saw was so distorted, I had zero sense of my own flesh. 

Now the pandemic was over and I was back to university. Then started a long pattern of people- romantic interests, mostly- abandoning me. They would have sex with me and just.. leave. All of them. 

My bestfriend was the best human being in my life. He died by suicide. I was the one who found him. I screamed, shouted but no one came to help. 

Months later, a friend of mine and I just started having feelings for each other. We got into a relationship. I thought finally.. some happiness. But slowly, in the trenches of the relationship, I started feeling very anxious in the relationship. Feelings of deep abandonement. Fear of abandonement. The relationship started to suffer because my ex was also mentally ill, and I guess I was a lot to take in general. After a year of dating, they broke up with me. Thrice. 

And since then, things just unraveled. I became absolutely dysfunctional. I would drink the whole day and when I couldn't afford, I would have cough syrup. Or anything to keep me drunk/high. I was so anxious going outside my apartment. I saw ex everyday in college. I just couldn't stop going to college because I wouldn't pass without a 75% attendance. But that happened anyway. I left my exams. My degree (2-year Masters degree in clinical psychology) ended in April. I still have to give two exams I skipped, to complete my degree.

In between this, I was on heavy Psychiatric drugs. As much as 15 in a day. Pretty sure I was abusing them as well. 

I am back home now, and no matter how hard I try I am persistently sad. I have been persistently sad all my life. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. I have tried all the meds there are, I've tried to kill myself multiple times. I am neither dead nor better. I try to visualise a future, but the past doesn't seem to leave. I can't study furthur because I still have to complete my degree.

&lt;p&gt;Then, the pandemic happened and something In me clicked. I bought a foodscale, a weighing machine and started working out like 5 hours a day. Eating like 500 calories a day. Obviously, I lost weight, but I&amp;#39;d developed an eating disorder by then. All I thought about was my body and I couldn&amp;#39;t stand to look in the mirror. Whatever I saw was so distorted, I had zero sense of my own flesh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the pandemic was over and I was back to university. Then started a long pattern of people- romantic interests, mostly- abandoning me. They would have sex with me and just.. leave. All of them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My bestfriend was the best human being in my life. He died by suicide. I was the one who found him. I screamed, shouted but no one came to help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Months later, a friend of mine and I just started having feelings for each other. We got into a relationship. I thought finally.. some happiness. But slowly, in the trenches of the relationship, I started feeling very anxious in the relationship. Feelings of deep abandonement. Fear of abandonement. The relationship started to suffer because my ex was also mentally ill, and I guess I was a lot to take in general. After a year of dating, they broke up with me. Thrice. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And since then, things just unraveled. I became absolutely dysfunctional. I would drink the whole day and when I couldn&amp;#39;t afford, I would have cough syrup. Or anything to keep me drunk/high. I was so anxious going outside my apartment. I saw ex everyday in college. I just couldn&amp;#39;t stop going to college because I wouldn&amp;#39;t pass without a 75% attendance. But that happened anyway. I left my exams. My degree (2-year Masters degree in clinical psychology) ended in April. I still have to give two exams I skipped, to complete my degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between this, I was on heavy Psychiatric drugs. As much as 15 in a day. Pretty sure I was abusing them as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am back home now, and no matter how hard I try I am persistently sad. I have been persistently sad all my life. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. I have tried all the meds there are, I&amp;#39;ve tried to kill myself multiple times. I am neither dead nor better. I try to visualise a future, but the past doesn&amp;#39;t seem to leave. I can&amp;#39;t study furthur because I still have to complete my degree. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. Dying isn&amp;#39;t that easy, I&amp;#39;ve tried countless times. I don&amp;#39;t know what do.&lt;/p&gt;

okay so, me and my ex had been dating for 2 years. we both had our flaws, we were young, and eachothers first love. she did things, i did things, but what i did was way worse. in september of 2023 i commited my greatest mistake and sin.

she was a special girl, at first she stayed with me and i swore to her i wouldn't do it again. but since then, she got further and further away from me. and i don't blame her for it. we were off and on but on the night of july 25th, she told me she was with someone else. i took it very badly because i still loved her (ironic, i know.) trust me, i know that i deserved for her to do that.

i do regret it very much. i apologized to her a million different times, and i would do anything to make it up to her. i would do anything to warn myself, to change the past. i was a really bad boyfriend, but it only took something as tragic to realize that i was a bad boyfriend. i wish i could tell myself to be a better man so i wouldn't lose her.

  
i feel extremely guilty and depressed. i cry almost every day all day, even though i should not be the one crying. and i cannot take care of myself. when i look in the mirror, i see a boy who could not control himself. i lost the love of my life because i was so fucking stupid. since that night, i have been hung up on alcohol and weed. i also struggle to keep meals down and usually throw up alot. i also cut myself alot, because i feel as though someone as bad as me deserves to feel that pain.



on top of it, im very jealous. i wish she was with me, and not him. but i know i shouldn't think that. i wish i didn't feel like this because i know im a bad person for doing this.

what im basically asking is, how do i make it up to her? should i wait for her? she said she forgived me, and that she knows that i really would do anything to make up for her, but i feel like shes only saying that so i dont hate myself. the truth is that i do hate myself, and i can hardly look in the mirror.

im not sure on how to be a better man. i know that i need to change, for her or for everybody. but im not sure how. i feel as though i will never be better than that boy in september who could not control his own body.

i guess this post is open ended. if you want to comment bad things about me, that is fine. if you want to give me advice, that is fine. i need to know how to forgive myself, because i can hardly look in the mirror. i carry a great shame, and i just wish i had a time machine so i can tell myself to be better sooner. how do i make sure she knows that i would do anything to fix us? do i even have a chance of being with her again after what i did?

she was my first love, and i still have very strong feelings to her. i know this is all ironic but i really just want to make it up to her one day. im struggling to move on because of my mistake. it feels like i will feel like this forever. im not sure if i could trust myself to date anyone else.

,depression,"(please forgive any mess. I'm doing this on my phone and it's hard to type and fix anything)

I'm over 50. Been suicidal since I was 14. 
Maybe even younger. I have dealt with severe migraines since I can remember. They made me quite crazy. 

Anyways. 

I'm currently stuck in a not great situation. But also. Even when I'm not, I can't seem to stay afloat. I have never had it somewhat easy. Life's always been extremely difficult. 

I just started having lots of health issues that are preventing me from trying to enjoy any semblance of normalcy.  Walks and doing anything that involve being on my feet are a thing of the past. 

Not that I have the energy to do anything. I haven't slept a decent night in years. I can't work. I can't do anything, and all I want to do is die. 
The wishing for death so badly has crippled me from getting anything done 

I feel like I can't move. I have zero will to live. 
I hate this life and everything in it. 
I've been in therapy since age 14. 
I'm currently on my 3rd round of dialectical behavioral therapy courses that are a year each. 

They have tought me skills to manage the depression supposedly. I can barely tell. I know the skills but I have no will to use them. 

I get pissed off when I see someone that has no hope and people just say. "" Get help"" 
What about the people that have had help their whole life. Help doesnt help. It almost makes it worse for a lot of people. 

I get it tho. Seems the go-to statement for anyone struggling is. ""get therapy"" I wouldn't know what else to say either. As I don't know what helps me feel better when I'm venting.no one can say the right thing so I basically hold it all in so I don't blow a gasket on someone. 

I've been more suicidal since ive been in 2 sessions of therapy a week. I feel like it takes all my time and energy. The days I have therapy are usually fucked afterwards. The emotional lifting I do in therapy is ridiculous. 

Anyways. 

I just don't know where else to turn for help.

I&amp;#39;m doing this on my phone and it&amp;#39;s hard to type and fix anything)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m over 50. Been suicidal since I was 14. 
Maybe even younger. I have dealt with severe migraines since I can remember. They made me quite crazy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m currently stuck in a not great situation. But also. Even when I&amp;#39;m not, I can&amp;#39;t seem to stay afloat. I have never had it somewhat easy. Life&amp;#39;s always been extremely difficult. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just started having lots of health issues that are preventing me from trying to enjoy any semblance of normalcy.  Walks and doing anything that involve being on my feet are a thing of the past. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that I have the energy to do anything. I haven&amp;#39;t slept a decent night in years. I can&amp;#39;t work. I can&amp;#39;t do anything, and all I want to do is die. 
The wishing for death so badly has crippled me from getting anything done &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I can&amp;#39;t move. I have zero will to live. 
I hate this life and everything in it. 
I&amp;#39;ve been in therapy since age 14. 
I&amp;#39;m currently on my 3rd round of dialectical behavioral therapy courses that are a year each. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have tought me skills to manage the depression supposedly. I can barely tell. I know the skills but I have no will to use them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get pissed off when I see someone that has no hope and people just say. &amp;quot; Get help&amp;quot; 
What about the people that have had help their whole life. Help doesnt help. It almost makes it worse for a lot of people. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get it tho. Seems the go-to statement for anyone struggling is. &amp;quot;get therapy&amp;quot; I wouldn&amp;#39;t know what else to say either. As I don&amp;#39;t know what helps me feel better when I&amp;#39;m venting.no one can say the right thing so I basically hold it all in so I don&amp;#39;t blow a gasket on someone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been more suicidal since ive been in 2 sessions of therapy a week. I feel like it takes all my time and energy. The days I have therapy are usually fucked afterwards. The emotional lifting I do in therapy is ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know where else to turn for help. 
As nothing seems to. 
I wish I had the guts and the know how to just fucking end it. But I don&amp;#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I’m not really sure why I think it matters, or what normal is…but I guess I want a sounding board as to how common it is to feel like I do after loss or whether I truly have depression.

In March, my grandmother died. She was 103, all I could really do was salute such an achievement because my mother had gone from sharp as tack to severe dementia within 3 months. Three incredibly painful months for her and for our family. My mother died in march, i sat and held her hand while her breaths became less frequent until one was finally her last.

I have a six month old baby, and had to do most of the funeral planning as my Dad has just fallen apart (they were together for 56 years) so i coasted through all that in a haze of activity and responsibility.

But now, a few months later I feel like I’ve heard people describe depression, and recognise it from my youth when I had no idea what it was.

I cannot really sleep, but I cannot get up. I have no interest in anything other than seeing that my Son’s needs are met. There are tears in my eyes or just behind them at all times. I cannot think straight.

I think its a dumb question, but I don’t know if this is just how grief is? There is a person who was infinitely kind and always believed in me and she’s gone. I feel so alone. I do not know what to do as I do not have the energy for life.

I started two retail jobs and I hate them, everyday I&amp;#39;m tired, anxious and in pain, the small amount of disability I get only covers my rent. I want to quit so badly, but I have so many other bills plus a horrible shopping addiction. I have no hobbies, friends and can&amp;#39;t drive. If money was not an issue, I&amp;#39;d never leave my house. I&amp;#39;m so mentally tired of living. I don&amp;#39;t want to go to work today, but I need the $60 on my check (pathetic).&lt;/p&gt;

What to do after you quit your job due to depression? I’ve been in bed all day staring at the ceiling or my screen. Sometimes I journal or write notes but that’s it. I can’t open my window blinds because I can’t stand sunlight. I have trouble getting outside the house. 

I’ve written tons of stuff in my to-do list, including building a sleep schedule, cleaning my house, getting a pet, having creative hobbies, volunteering, doing part-time gig, etc. but I have no energy to do any of them.

I don’t want to do anything. For the first time in my life, I’m letting myself do what I want, which is nothing. For the first time in my life, I stop ignoring my emotions.

But this can’t go on forever? When I do nothing, I can’t help but ruminate on my trauma and feel anxious.

,depression,"first off, i know im a bad person. i just need to tell the truth for once, so i can feel like a man.

okay so, me and my ex had been dating for 2 years. we both had our flaws, we were young, and eachothers first love. she did things, i did things, but what i did was way worse. in september of 2023 i commited my greatest mistake and sin.

she was a special girl, at first she stayed with me and i swore to her i wouldn't do it again. but since then, she got further and further away from me. and i don't blame her for it. we were off and on but on the night of july 25th, she told me she was with someone else. i took it very badly because i still loved her (ironic, i know.) trust me, i know that i deserved for her to do that.

i do regret it very much. i apologized to her a million different times, and i would do anything to make it up to her. i would do anything to warn myself, to change the past. i was a really bad boyfriend, but it only took something as tragic to realize that i was a bad boyfriend. i wish i could tell myself to be a better man so i wouldn't lose her.

i feel extremely guilty and depressed. i cry almost every day all day, even though i should not be the one crying. and i cannot take care of myself. when i look in the mirror, i see a boy who could not control himself. i lost the love of my life because i was so fucking stupid. since that night, i have been hung up on alcohol and weed. i also struggle to keep meals down and usually throw up alot. i also cut myself alot, because i feel as though someone as bad as me deserves to feel that pain.

on top of it, im very jealous. i wish she was with me, and not him. but i know i shouldn't think that. i wish i didn't feel like this because i know im a bad person for doing this.

what im basically asking is, how do i make it up to her? should i wait for her? she said she forgived me, and that she knows that i really would do anything to make up for her, but i feel like shes only saying that so i dont hate myself. the truth is that i do hate myself, and i can hardly look in the mirror.

im not sure on how to be a better man. i know that i need to change, for her or for everybody. but im not sure how. i feel as though i will never be better than that boy in september who could not control his own body.

i guess this post is open ended. if you want to comment bad things about me, that is fine. if you want to give me advice, that is fine. i need to know how to forgive myself, because i can hardly look in the mirror. i carry a great shame, and i just wish i had a time machine so i can tell myself to be better sooner. how do i make sure she knows that i would do anything to fix us? do i even have a chance of being with her again after what i did?

she was my first love, and i still have very strong feelings to her. i know this is all ironic but i really just want to make it up to her one day. im struggling to move on because of my mistake. it feels like i will feel like this forever. im not sure if i could trust myself to date anyone else.

thank you for reading this post if you did read all of it. i know im a bad person, but in making this, i hope i can become a better man for her.

&lt;p&gt;i do regret it very much. i apologized to her a million different times, and i would do anything to make it up to her. i would do anything to warn myself, to change the past. i was a really bad boyfriend, but it only took something as tragic to realize that i was a bad boyfriend. i wish i could tell myself to be a better man so i wouldn&amp;#39;t lose her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i feel extremely guilty and depressed. i cry almost every day all day, even though i should not be the one crying. and i cannot take care of myself. when i look in the mirror, i see a boy who could not control himself. i lost the love of my life because i was so fucking stupid. since that night, i have been hung up on alcohol and weed. i also struggle to keep meals down and usually throw up alot. i also cut myself alot, because i feel as though someone as bad as me deserves to feel that pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;on top of it, im very jealous. i wish she was with me, and not him. but i know i shouldn&amp;#39;t think that. i wish i didn&amp;#39;t feel like this because i know im a bad person for doing this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;what im basically asking is, how do i make it up to her? should i wait for her? she said she forgived me, and that she knows that i really would do anything to make up for her, but i feel like shes only saying that so i dont hate myself. the truth is that i do hate myself, and i can hardly look in the mirror.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;im not sure on how to be a better man. i know that i need to change, for her or for everybody. but im not sure how. i feel as though i will never be better than that boy in september who could not control his own body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i guess this post is open ended. if you want to comment bad things about me, that is fine. if you want to give me advice, that is fine. i need to know how to forgive myself, because i can hardly look in the mirror. i carry a great shame, and i just wish i had a time machine so i can tell myself to be better sooner. how do i make sure she knows that i would do anything to fix us? do i even have a chance of being with her again after what i did?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;she was my first love, and i still have very strong feelings to her. i know this is all ironic but i really just want to make it up to her one day. im struggling to move on because of my mistake. it feels like i will feel like this forever. im not sure if i could trust myself to date anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;thank you for reading this post if you did read all of it. i know im a bad person, but in making this, i hope i can become a better man for her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;edit: i know that people like me who have done terrible things are reasons why you wonderful people are on this sub reddit. i am sorry. i just dont know what to do. i am really lost&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"31M uni student (B.sc biology major) currently work nights 32hrs/week at a supermarket. Living with my ex and our 2 year old son. We split up after 13 years because we were/are both unhappy, neither can afford to rent on a single income, because it would be over half either of our wages just to live in a small unit.

Even if we could find separate places, she wont agree to a week on week off arrangement with our son. And then even if she agreed to that, she's anti-vax and where we live vaccinations required for daycare.   
  
I work nights and she works days, which means I am the daycare during the day until I go to work at night. This leaves very little room to study.

I've nearly finished my degree, but we still live in our home town, and it has very few career paths to pursue in my field of study. The plan was to move to a bigger city and get a job, but then everything fell apart.

I feel extremely trapped.  
  
I can't date, because I'm a 31 year old single dad living with his ex.  
I can't pursue the career I wanted.  
I can't live anywhere I want to.

As much as I love my son, I ruined my life by having him. My hopes of achieving what I want in life are all gone, I didn't ever want kids, but she convinced me in the end. 

It hit me really hard tonight while I was trying to finish an assessment that is due in the morning. I didn't even finish it, I just stopped caring and decided I'll just hand it in late at some point.

I don't know what to do. I know it's my own fault, but I am having a hard time accepting that I'll never get to do the things I wanted to do in life.

,depression,"Do you guys wonder how different your lives would be if you were born neurotypical? I wonder all the time. It's always been a struggle, depression at 13 and a ""better late than never"" autism diagnosis at 30. 17 years of this, at least i know why i was always misunderstood. I hate the feeling of being misunderstood, I hate unfairness in general. 

Don't get me wrong, even as I lament the life I could've lived and mourn for the person I could be but am not, I still realize I'm only 30 and having doctors and diagnoses and meds is better than not. I just want the green light to rest.

Not ""eternal slumber"" rest, just the green light to let off my shoulders the years of being misunderstood, the weight that injustices of decades past that still (see prior neurovirgency details for explanation) haunts and clings to me.

I know that pain is a teacher. The child touches the hot stove once, if he's smart. I have a problem where I often cannot tell when the pain has stopped being useful to me, so I hang on to it far too long as if there's a final lesson to be learned still. 

Maybe the last lesson is to take that leap of faith and say ""I've ruminated over this for 3 months, screw it"" and try to convince myself that doing so will not cause the world to implode and my family (who are all extremely loving and supportive) to shun me like some ancient tribe.

It's the time that I worry about with mental illness. It takes time out of every day to be mentally ill. I need a longer notice than 1 day usually for a social meeting just to psych myself up. If I have something bad happen that really hurts me emotionally, it could set me back for months. Months that the people who hurt me are out living and moving forward, while I have to remember how to trust people again.

,depression,"I've been struggling with depression for quite some time now. I'm a man, aged 32. It was especially bad in coronavirus times, when I lost my job and girlfriend. But I somehow got through it, because I had a lot of other things on my mind. But right now, I have a cushy office job. From the outside you'd think everything was ok in my life. I got an ok job, an ok apartment, 2 cars... But it's just the face I put on. I leave the house and I'm in ""automatic"" mode. I do what's required of me and when I'm back home - I unwind. Usually with a glass of whiskey in my hand.

Anyway... Today I felt particularly full of negativity. I didn't want to talk to anybody today. I didn't want to see anything outside my house. Even when I talked to my parents... in the back of my mind was a feeling of ""When is this talk going to be over"", but I continued talking with them as if nothing was wrong. Now, I love my parents and I like talking to them.  
After we finished talking, I felt intense hatred and anger in me. Really intense, almost like never before. I smashed my fists together as hard as I could, got up and punched the wall until I noticed blood on my right hand. I washed my hands and cleaned the wall and then I cried for about 2 minutes. Not from the pain of hitting the wall, but a sense of being overwhelmed by it all. I don't know.

Anyway... this happened about half an hour ago and the feeling of intense anger is gone. I don't feel as sad. I feel neutral and a lot more social. I also served in the military if that matters... Guess I was taught to get a grip and carry on and maybe that helps.  
The problem is still there. But it's not as severe at the moment. It's like my little episode was like a relief valve on a high pressure system.

I tried getting help twice. First time the lady doctor didn't even hear me out and went on about the typical bullshit, how I wasn't hugged enough as a kid and that's why I was having issues. No! I had a good childhood and my parents were and continue to be supportive and love me.   
So I tried a second time. Got an appointment for a psychiatrist. Guy listened to me go on for 20 minutes about my problems and then said I was fine and that's it. I wasn't prescribed any meds, I didn't get any more appointments for therapy. It's like the doctor didn't want to deal with me.

,depression,"

Hey,
Sorry,dass ich euch hier zutexte,aber ich muss mir das mal von der Seele schreiben,um einigermaßen (hoffentlich) mal wieder ein Auge zuzubekommen.
Manchmal frage ich mich,sitzen da oben irgendwelche geisteskranken zusammen und denken sich sowas aus? 

Mein Leben ist wie ein Horrorfilm. Mit 11 Jahren hatte ich eine beste Freundin, Sabrina. Wir waren immer irgendwie zusammen,selbst nach ihrer OP war ich bei ihr. Ja,dann war sie tot. Mit 9!! Das begleitet mich bis heute. 

Meine Mum ist ein Mensch,der mich noch nie in den Arm genommen hat,geschweige denn gesagt hat,dass sie mich liebt. Wenn ich mal als Kind krank war,war sie mir böse. 
Und das zeigte sie immer,indem sie mich ignorierte.
Einmal 7 Monate am Stück kein Wort mit mir geredet. Nicht beachtet. Eiskalt. Und auf Nachfrage nur gesagt: Ist Nix. Dann wieder Schweigen. 
Meine Mum hatte eine beste Freundin, die an Krebs verstarb. Sie hinterließ eine Tochter, die 7 Jahre jünger als ich ist und bat meine Mutter,sich um die Tochter zu kümmern. 

Dieses Mädchen wurde praktisch von meiner Mum adoptiert und siehe da,meine Mutter kann lieben! Nur halt nicht mich. 

Immerhin bin ich mit 21 Jahren mit meinem ersten Freund zusammengekommen. Die Liebe meines Lebens. Ich zog mit ihm zusammen und wurde Grundschullehrerin,ein langes Studium und hartes Ref. Mit Mobbing. Aber egal,es war geschafft. 
Wir hatten Höhen und Tiefen aber er war mein bester Freund, meine Familie. Ich war mit ihm zusammen aufgewachsen,kannte ihn praktisch mein Leben lang. 
Wollten heiraten. 

Dann starb ganz plötzlich mein Dad. Allein. In seiner Wohnung,in die er gezogen war,nachdem sich meine Eltern getrennt hatten. Anstatt dass die Familie zusammenrückt, machte mich meine Tante (Dads Schwester) für seinen Tod verantwortlich und prügelte mich. 
Sie nahm Oma zu sich und verweigerte mir den Kontakt zu ihr, aus Rache oder so.

Ich wollte nichts Böses,nur meine Oma sehen, die auch schon nach mir fragte und mich vermisste. 
Eines Tages,als ich Blumen zu Dads Grab brachte,entdeckte ich das Grab meiner Oma. Richtig krank. Meine Tante hatte es niemandem gesagt,dass sie gestorben ist. Ich konnte nicht mal zur Beerdigung.

Es geht weiter.
Gerade in dem Moment,als ich dachte,ich will jetzt meine eigene Familie gründen, kam es. 
Ich dachte,ich brech weg. 
Mein Verlobter machte Schluss. Nach 12 Jahren.
Wegen einer anderen Frau.

Ich dachte,ich überlebe das hier nicht,wog 42 Kilo. Totaler Tiefpunkt meines Lebens. Alles,aber wirklich alles weg.
Bis auf eines: Die Tanzschule.
Ging dort dann wieder regelmäßiger hin, musste ja irgendwie wieder bei Null anfangen und war dort eigentlich schon seit 2017 Mitglied. 
Ich lernte dort jemanden kennen und verliebte mich. Hätte nie gedacht,dass ich das nochmal könnte.  Ein Jahr lang hielt er mich hin. Spielte heiß/kalt. Sagte, er brauche noch Zeit aber will unbedingt eine Beziehung mit mir.

Ich erwischte ihn beim Sex mit einer anderen. 
Ich brach den Kontakt ab und was ist passiert? Genau, er ist jetzt mit einer anderen aus der Tanzschule zusammen. Plötzlich ist seine Bindungsangst weg! 
Ich kann euch nicht sagen,wie sehr mir das wehtut, so dermaßen fertig bin ich.

Ich werde also gehen müssen,denn angucken kann und will ich mir das nicht.
Meine beste Freundin hat mich heute für ihn und seine Neue versetzt,spielt also jetzt in seinem Team. 

Ichbin seit 7 verfickten Jahren Mitglied in dieser Tanzschule und werde mich abmelden müssen und wieder da anfangen,wo ich mich bestens auskenne: bei Null und im tiefsten Loch.

Achso und zum Thema neuen Mann kennenlernen und Familie gründen. Ich bin 35 und ein Test beim Gyn hat gezeigt (welch Wunder) dass ich nicht schwanger werden kann.

Mein gesamtes Leben ist geprägt von unerwiderter Liebe, plötzlichem Verlassenwerden und Verlusten.
Ich war immer das Aschenputtel, mehr nicht. Ich hasse mein Leben,trotz Therapie und Antidepressiva komme ich mit dem Verarbeiten nicht nach.
Ich hasse mein Leben.

Sorry,dass ich euch hier zutexte,aber ich muss mir das mal von der Seele schreiben,um einigermaßen (hoffentlich) mal wieder ein Auge zuzubekommen.
Manchmal frage ich mich,sitzen da oben irgendwelche geisteskranken zusammen und denken sich sowas aus? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mein Leben ist wie ein Horrorfilm. Mit 11 Jahren hatte ich eine beste Freundin, Sabrina. Wir waren immer irgendwie zusammen,selbst nach ihrer OP war ich bei ihr. Ja,dann war sie tot. Mit 9!! Das begleitet mich bis heute. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meine Mum ist ein Mensch,der mich noch nie in den Arm genommen hat,geschweige denn gesagt hat,dass sie mich liebt. Wenn ich mal als Kind krank war,war sie mir böse. 
Und das zeigte sie immer,indem sie mich ignorierte.
Einmal 7 Monate am Stück kein Wort mit mir geredet. Nicht beachtet. Eiskalt. Und auf Nachfrage nur gesagt: Ist Nix. Dann wieder Schweigen. 
Meine Mum hatte eine beste Freundin, die an Krebs verstarb. Sie hinterließ eine Tochter, die 7 Jahre jünger als ich ist und bat meine Mutter,sich um die Tochter zu kümmern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dieses Mädchen wurde praktisch von meiner Mum adoptiert und siehe da,meine Mutter kann lieben! Nur halt nicht mich. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immerhin bin ich mit 21 Jahren mit meinem ersten Freund zusammengekommen. Die Liebe meines Lebens. Ich zog mit ihm zusammen und wurde Grundschullehrerin,ein langes Studium und hartes Ref. Mit Mobbing. Aber egal,es war geschafft. 
Wir hatten Höhen und Tiefen aber er war mein bester Freund, meine Familie. Ich war mit ihm zusammen aufgewachsen,kannte ihn praktisch mein Leben lang. 
Wollten heiraten. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dann starb ganz plötzlich mein Dad. Allein. In seiner Wohnung,in die er gezogen war,nachdem sich meine Eltern getrennt hatten. Anstatt dass die Familie zusammenrückt, machte mich meine Tante (Dads Schwester) für seinen Tod verantwortlich und prügelte mich. 
Sie nahm Oma zu sich und verweigerte mir den Kontakt zu ihr, aus Rache oder so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ich wollte nichts Böses,nur meine Oma sehen, die auch schon nach mir fragte und mich vermisste. 
Eines Tages,als ich Blumen zu Dads Grab brachte,entdeckte ich das Grab meiner Oma. Richtig krank. Meine Tante hatte es niemandem gesagt,dass sie gestorben ist. Ich konnte nicht mal zur Beerdigung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Es geht weiter.
Gerade in dem Moment,als ich dachte,ich will jetzt meine eigene Familie gründen, kam es. 
Ich dachte,ich brech weg. 
Mein Verlobter machte Schluss. Nach 12 Jahren.
Wegen einer anderen Frau.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ich dachte,ich überlebe das hier nicht,wog 42 Kilo. Totaler Tiefpunkt meines Lebens. Alles,aber wirklich alles weg.
Bis auf eines: Die Tanzschule.
Ging dort dann wieder regelmäßiger hin, musste ja irgendwie wieder bei Null anfangen und war dort eigentlich schon seit 2017 Mitglied. 
Ich lernte dort jemanden kennen und verliebte mich. Hätte nie gedacht,dass ich das nochmal könnte.  Ein Jahr lang hielt er mich hin. Spielte heiß/kalt. Sagte, er brauche noch Zeit aber will unbedingt eine Beziehung mit mir.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ich erwischte ihn beim Sex mit einer anderen. 
Ich brach den Kontakt ab und was ist passiert? Genau, er ist jetzt mit einer anderen aus der Tanzschule zusammen. Plötzlich ist seine Bindungsangst weg! 
Ich kann euch nicht sagen,wie sehr mir das wehtut, so dermaßen fertig bin ich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ich werde also gehen müssen,denn angucken kann und will ich mir das nicht.

,depression,"TLDR: I need advice on how to tell someone that I want to die, that I feel empty and life is a haze with each day slipping into the next ad nauseum ad mortem. You don't need to read the rest, it's just why I struggle with figuring it out on my own

I have been sitting here, looking at the post screen, my half removed tooth still keeps agonisingly thumping on and on and on, and you know what? I think I like that, I think I feel alive because of that, my head hurts and I feel disorientated from it, but I feel alive. One could argue that this is some weird representation of myself, I am suffering in my head and I won't tell anyone I know, because I fear help. 

As I write this it is no surprise to me, I have basically convinced myself that suffering is making me alive, I want to die so dearly, to just stop being, the lack of any embrace, if I drank I'd say it was intoxicating like beer or whatever. I just want to spend my life in bed without anyone knowing I was there, I can't sleep because I never felt awake in the first place, I'm going through life like a haze, yer again reminding me of how hard it is to think straight with the rotting nerve endings of my tooth screaming at my like my own thoughts do. 

Much like the tooth I don't know how much longer I may endure it, I fear I may yank it out instead of talking it out. I have tried to endure for years, I don't know when it began because it felt like it was always there; I never knew a day without it. 

I am terrified of getting help, I tried therapy before, I basically lied through my unbrushed teeth because I was younger then, my mother was in the room with the therapist so I did not dare say what I truly thought. I remember distinctly when she saw my self harm scars, she threatened to show my younger siblings and my father, shaming me for it. 


I have contacted suicide and crisis hotlines before, each time they explained how to help, each time I didn't do what they said because it always would end up with someone else finding out, which scared me to no end.

Okay so long story short my husband has been depressed. He has dealt with depression his whole life but it’s gotten really bad recently. For context we recently moved to Alabama from Utah. His family lives in California. We are currently staying with my parents while our house is being built. We have one more month until it is done. He gets along super well with my family. He works as an accountant and does super well at his job and is up for promotion next year when someone is retiring. We play video games together and it’s our number one hobby. He said nothing outside of personal relationships are making him happy. He comes home from work and nothing he does makes him happy. I try to get him to play games or watch movies and try to help anyway I can to suggest things we can do outside the house too but he is a natural homebody anyways so doesn’t want to go out. He said he feels like he’s not doing enough not making enough money not taking care of himself ect… he just makes these lists of things that he feels he needs to do better. I try to listen and tell him that no one else thinks this and he is putting this pressure on himself. He really is amazing and I’m trying to help him see that. He keeps insisting that he isn’t putting pressure on himself and he is just depressed. Normally when he gets in a funk the next day after some food and sleep he feels better. But this has been going on for weeks. I try to keep reassuring him he is doing enough and I truly love him and think he is the best man. I’m just not sure what to do or what can help.

I'm sorry, but you won't be able to understand much of this post without the context. 



So this happened two days ago/a day after my last post.

I woke up at 11 am and my parents were talking about how my aunt had called my mom in the morning asking about my bank account details( implying that she'd help finance my career).  I thought it was weird how last night my aunt/uncles/cousins had seriously stated how much this offer should not be known by my parents so that they don't influence my decision and today my aunt just offered it to my mom. 

My parents were initially against the Idea and didn't wanna accept help but then I tried to convince them how it would actually be beneficial for me for now and they could just pay my relatives back when they received their money. They agreed after a long conversation. My mom then called my aunt to accept the offer but only for one semester so that they could pay my relatives as soon as they could and my aunt was okay with that. 

I got a group call from my cousins at night and they asked why I couldn't do the only thing that they had asked of me which was to not tell my parents about the offer. I told them that I only discussed this topic with my parents because my aunt had already told my mom about it. My cousins then asked my aunt while still on call and she fully denied ever mentioning financial support to my mom. My cousins then just lectured me the entire call about how I lied to the people who were willing to help my career. I kept denying it but I don't think they believed me. I cried and then pretended like nothing happened to my parents as I don't think they would've appreciated me telling my parents about anything related to the offer.

Apparently, after the call about my mom accepting the offer by my relatives with my aunt, my aunt told my cousins and uncles that I had told them everything about the conversation that they had with me, which is why my cousins had called me at night.

  
I then woke up the next morning to my mom showing me a message that my aunt sent to her just now. It said that I should pursue a completely different career path as it could pay more( implying that they revoked the financial support offer). I opened my phone and she wrote the same thing to me. I just went to the bathroom and had a breakdown like always and came back.

  
I texted my cousin about it in the calmest way and he just said that my aunt/uncles/cousins just aren't sure they can help anymore as there is a risk that something like this could happen in the future as well and my relatives also have limited finances with their own families. I said that I could never give them the guarantee that something like this won't happen in the future as I don't control the finances, my parents do, and can only make sure to remind them. I also asked if they still thought that I had lied and he said that He didn't. I said it was okay and I'm tired of talking about my career for today at the end.

  
I just have one question, shouldn't my cousins/aunts/relatives at least be sure that they can or cannot finance me before offering me this serious opportunity? I was ready to lie to my parents for the sake of my career for these two days but still got accused of lying and had that opportunity revoked.

  
I feel like it was a prank at the most wrong time lol. I haven't picked up any of the calls from my friends in that college because I don't have a good update nor am i gonna be able to talk to normal when my life is declining. They must think that I've become an asshole now. 

  
I had such a big headache that day from all the crying that I had to take a paracetamol and I just didn't wanna talk about my future for the day. At night, my mom started to talk to my aunt initially for work-related purposes which shifted to them talking about how it's annoying that I won't tell them about my conversations with my aunt/cousins/uncles. I couldn't keep it in anymore so I walked out crying to the bathroom. My mom kept talking to my aunt even after I ran. I came back after an hour and they kept pressing me about the conversations that I had to confess and my parents felt sorry for me.



It's already SO hard receiving messages from all the club/college messages where My friends discuss what they're gonna do tomorrow. Posts of everyone enjoying college on social media. I wanna break my phone. It feels like everyone is moving forward and everything in my life is moving back except my age. I'll turn 19 this year.

  
Rewatching old shows is the only way of detaching myself from reality so I won't cry every second. It gets even worse lol because my mom keeps talking about my relatives in a bad way but I just don't wanna hear their names anymore, sorry. So now my mom thinks I'm rude, my friends think I'm an asshole and my relatives think I'm a liar.

  
Life feels like a tragic tale that no one will remember. That's why I'm writing this. Maybe one day someone will discover my phone and look at this (delulu). I think it deserves a cry :)

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry, but you won&amp;#39;t be able to understand much of this post without the context. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this happened two days ago/a day after my last post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I woke up at 11 am and my parents were talking about how my aunt had called my mom in the morning asking about my bank account details( implying that she&amp;#39;d help finance my career).  I thought it was weird how last night my aunt/uncles/cousins had seriously stated how much this offer should not be known by my parents so that they don&amp;#39;t influence my decision and today my aunt just offered it to my mom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents were initially against the Idea and didn&amp;#39;t wanna accept help but then I tried to convince them how it would actually be beneficial for me for now and they could just pay my relatives back when they received their money. They agreed after a long conversation. My mom then called my aunt to accept the offer but only for one semester so that they could pay my relatives as soon as they could and my aunt was okay with that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got a group call from my cousins at night and they asked why I couldn&amp;#39;t do the only thing that they had asked of me which was to not tell my parents about the offer. I told them that I only discussed this topic with my parents because my aunt had already told my mom about it. My cousins then asked my aunt while still on call and she fully denied ever mentioning financial support to my mom. My cousins then just lectured me the entire call about how I lied to the people who were willing to help my career. I kept denying it but I don&amp;#39;t think they believed me. I cried and then pretended like nothing happened to my parents as I don&amp;#39;t think they would&amp;#39;ve appreciated me telling my parents about anything related to the offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently, after the call about my mom accepting the offer by my relatives with my aunt, my aunt told my cousins and uncles that I had told them everything about the conversation that they had with me, which is why my cousins had called me at night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then woke up the next morning to my mom showing me a message that my aunt sent to her just now. It said that I should pursue a completely different career path as it could pay more( implying that they revoked the financial support offer). I opened my phone and she wrote the same thing to me. I just went to the bathroom and had a breakdown like always and came back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I texted my cousin about it in the calmest way and he just said that my aunt/uncles/cousins just aren&amp;#39;t sure they can help anymore as there is a risk that something like this could happen in the future as well and my relatives also have limited finances with their own families. I said that I could never give them the guarantee that something like this won&amp;#39;t happen in the future as I don&amp;#39;t control the finances, my parents do, and can only make sure to remind them. I also asked if they still thought that I had lied and he said that He didn&amp;#39;t. I said it was okay and I&amp;#39;m tired of talking about my career for today at the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just have one question, shouldn&amp;#39;t my cousins/aunts/relatives at least be sure that they can or cannot finance me before offering me this serious opportunity? I was ready to lie to my parents for the sake of my career for these two days but still got accused of lying and had that opportunity revoked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like it was a prank at the most wrong time lol. I haven&amp;#39;t picked up any of the calls from my friends in that college because I don&amp;#39;t have a good update nor am i gonna be able to talk to normal when my life is declining. They must think that I&amp;#39;ve become an asshole now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had such a big headache that day from all the crying that I had to take a paracetamol and I just didn&amp;#39;t wanna talk about my future for the day. At night, my mom started to talk to my aunt initially for work-related purposes which shifted to them talking about how it&amp;#39;s annoying that I won&amp;#39;t tell them about my conversations with my aunt/cousins/uncles. I couldn&amp;#39;t keep it in anymore so I walked out crying to the bathroom. My mom kept talking to my aunt even after I ran. I came back after an hour and they kept pressing me about the conversations that I had to confess and my parents felt sorry for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s already SO hard receiving messages from all the club/college messages where My friends discuss what they&amp;#39;re gonna do tomorrow. Posts of everyone enjoying college on social media. I wanna break my phone. It feels like everyone is moving forward and everything in my life is moving back except my age. I&amp;#39;ll turn 19 this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rewatching old shows is the only way of detaching myself from reality so I won&amp;#39;t cry every second. It gets even worse lol because my mom keeps talking about my relatives in a bad way but I just don&amp;#39;t wanna hear their names anymore, sorry. So now my mom thinks I&amp;#39;m rude, my friends think I&amp;#39;m an asshole and my relatives think I&amp;#39;m a liar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life feels like a tragic tale that no one will remember. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m writing this. Maybe one day someone will discover my phone and look at this (delulu). I think it deserves a cry :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there Anything I can do?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"My life fucking sucks, and it has for the past two years now. During the final week of 2021, I left an emotionally abusive relationship and ended up with Covid. During that time, I developed painful open diabetic ulcers atop both of my feet, which took 10 months to clear. November 2022, I moved out of a volatile household situation (alcoholic roommate), and moved in with a nearby co-worker/friend.

,depression,"So on January I have opened a business, and I have decided to partner with my best friend as we complete each other in terms of business. 

We were driving a motorcycle, and we crashed. This night, I was traumatized as he almost lost his life,his  teeth has fell off, nose is severed, lips is splitted, and skull fractures. 

I have resumed the business on my own, and I fixed the bike as we shared it. Few months later he is better, and he started going to the gym and hangong out with his friends, and I am handling the business trying to make it reach the takeoff stage. But I failed doing it on my own. 

So I told him, now you’re better, you should be in charge because there is so much that I don’t understand, he said I willing to close it. 

So we agreed to close it. I am now working on a 9-5 job that I don’t really like, just so I can cover my expenses, and I remember all of those months I have spent on my own waking up everyday to be there for the business. Sacrificing my social life so I can take it somewhere else. All the money I have lost, and All what I saw in terms of stress and anxiety. It turned into depression. 

I don’t know from where to start and where to end it. But I lost money, business, friends, and a relationship as I broke up with my GF when the accident happened as my life turned chaotic in one night. 

I am still collecting the pieces, and I hope for an upcoming trend. But I feel nothing but confusion and a void.

&lt;p&gt;We were driving a motorcycle, and we crashed. This night, I was traumatized as he almost lost his life,his  teeth has fell off, nose is severed, lips is splitted, and skull fractures. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have resumed the business on my own, and I fixed the bike as we shared it. Few months later he is better, and he started going to the gym and hangong out with his friends, and I am handling the business trying to make it reach the takeoff stage. But I failed doing it on my own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I told him, now you’re better, you should be in charge because there is so much that I don’t understand, he said I willing to close it. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm just tired. I can make giant strides in improving, I can go almost a week without making my thighs look like an aspen tree, and then shit (usually relating to extremely close friends nearly killing themselves) fucks me up and throws me back down at rock bottom. The more this happens, the more I just want to give up, because it always ends the same way, and destroys me over and over and over and over and over and fucking over again. Just numb at this point, and genuinely scared as to who'll get fucked up next. I'd be dead if not for my friends, but two of my closest are also two of the most suicidal friends I have. One of them nearly killed themselves just yesterday, which is the most recent back-to-the-bottom part of the cycle.

I can't fucking do this shit, man. Just can't. Nothing in my life is in my control anymore and I just give up trying to reign it in--every time I do, life always reminds me that I can't get out of this fucking hell-hole, no matter how hard I try.

Not helped that I'm a trans, neurodivergent, and depressed lad in Utah. I think I'm overdue for my death via suicide by a long-shot. Hell, I nearly convinced myself to kick the bucket last night, and I've been generally numb since then (not helped by the fact I doubtless scarred myself last night too, lost at least 3x more blood from s/h that day than I had in a literal month or two.

I'm gay, but I've never been in a relationship. Nobody knows “officially”, except my parents, who pressure and manipulate me to hide the situation.

I went bald when I was 21/22 and it completely destroyed my self-esteem. I'm afraid to expose myself socially. It makes me nervous to go out in the street. When I look in the mirror, I explode with anger and sadness and start crying.

In general, I'm small, short, pale and unattractive. I had a failed hair transplant, which makes me look rather odd. 

When I see boys my age, on the street, social networks, etc., so much more attractive than me, with such “normal” looks and hair, it makes me so sad that I'm not like that... 

I feel like I'll never find anyone. And even if I do, I live in a very homophobic environment, and all my (very few) friends are also homophobic.

I feel so sad and alone. 

And I don't see how my life can change in the future. I'll never have a family or children. I deeply hate my job,  which takes up all my time and all my life. I hate all the moments that have passed from my life. I feel like I've completely wasted it, to little fault of mine.

Nothing gives me pleasure. No hobbies, nothing. 

I know I've been depressed for years. But I don't see any reason to see a professional. They're not going to change my appearance or change anything that ails me. I don't want to learn to live with my “abnormality” (not talking about being guy, but rather my looks and strange way of being), I just want to be normal. Or not to be at all.

,depression,"TW: Self-h*rm, su*cidal thoughts, su*cide attempt

‼️Long read but please bare with me, the storytelling is messy sorry I'm writing this while trying to hold my tears‼️

I don't think I can handle this anymore. In my 18 years of living, I can handle any more torture and pain. I am f*cking done living. I f*cking hate my family, especially my dad. I hate my mom for tolerating what my dad does because ""discipline"" and because of ""religion."" I hate my younger brother for being a toxic male like my dad. And I especially hate my dad because of all the physical, mental, emotional, religious trauma, and baggage that he gave me. I don't think I'll last until my next birthday. I've been having su*cide thoughts again and recently I've been drinking 2-3 pills of whatever medication I can find. I f*cking hate living.

It all started before I was born, my father is the carrier of the poison that is now flowing in my veins. He was almost 30, my mom is 21 and just graduated college. She got pregnant when she was 21 so based on that info, I think my dad was pursuing my mom since she was 19 or 20. When my mom got pregnant, her whole world broke and she isolated herself until her birth. She had abortion thoughts and I wish she did abort me, maybe then she would be happy and living her dream. I broke her dreams, I am the cause of it all. Thankfully her family accepted her and my dad showed up at my mom's house when I was around 2. I wish he didn't, maybe my life would've been completely different. Him and my mom got married and the rest was history. History of abuse that is. My earliest memory of being physically abused was when I was around 3 or 4. Haha ain't it funny, the very first memory I am conscious about is abuse. I vividly remember me crying near the doorway outside and my mom packing our things. Idk what happened then because I wasn't conscious enough. Then from then I'd get beat up whenever I make a mistake. Whether small or big, I was smacked with what my father can grab and he would hit me where the weapon would land. I can't even remember the rest of my childhood haha. Idk man. The physical abuse got worse as I grow up. I get compared to kids that are smarter than me, he's the one to do so yet he graduated with low grades. The peak of physical abuse was around 10-14. I can't remember much haha, sorry. He only stopped when I was 16 but he moved to mental and emotional abuse, no wait he didn't move he just amplified it a ton. Honestly I think this is the age I started to be reserved and more quiet, I also space out a lot and my memory went sh*t. I oversex*alize myself and I hate it. He didn't s*xually abuse me tho, I think it's because I think I deserve to be punished, to be beaten, even to be f*ckin killed. I had my very first s*icide attempt when I was around 14. I tried hanging myself, the rope snapped. I tried it 2 more times and the last time, I think it almost worked but one of our neighbor who is around my age saw me and got me down. From then on I think I got addicted of taking meds. I would take any meds I find and pop a pill or two(sometimes 3) haha. And now I'm 18, I'm starting to feel the effect. I swear something is wrong with me idk what tho haha but it's fine there are way bigger problems in the world than what am feeling. I guess this is also one of the reason why I am a big empath despite not feeling emotion other than constantly hating myself and my dad. I am feeling even more pressure now that I am gonna go in a university that the tuition is super not cheap and I need to maintain my scholarship to study there. I am not smart, never have been. It doesn't help too that my univ is just across where my whole family is living so I'll be living with them and attending the ""religion"" that also destroyed my mental health. Idk what to do man. I just wanna live my life. I'm thinking of ending it all before school starts. Idk anymore. It's either i die or my dad dies. Idk If I can plan a m*rder on him so I'll probably just kms. Hahaha sorry for being pathetic and acting like a pick me. Idk wjat to do. Everyday I hate myself and I drown myself with games, videos, p*rn, or anything just anything to feel something. I don't c*t myself because I feel like it's super messy and it'll be obvious I'm harming myself. I wanna f*cking die man, idk what to do anymore. I'm drowning and I'm too afraid to ask my friends for help because like an anchor, I might bring them down too and be a burden to them. Haha idk anymore

,depression,"I live with my parents currently and my main issue is no motivation to do anything, apathy (mild?), fatigue etc. Don’t know if that’s depression, don’t really care, you lot are probably quite numb/sad if you’re here and that’s how I feel so hopefully this fits the subreddit. Haven’t read the rules, if I’ve not followed them remove the post so on and so forth.

I’m only 18, just finished school, life isn’t going great. My motivation is always at or next to 0 and I don’t think living with people that can support me is helping. I’m planning to move out (or at least half move out, my stuff will probably stay in parents’ house. I’ve thought about it a lot and I think finally getting a job and making myself face the possibility of homelessness is the only thing that will motivate me to not be a zombie. I want to experience physical rock bottom so I have a reason to do anything. It might not be a good idea, it might be a form of self sabotage or isolation, I don’t much care at this point; I struggle to comprehend a more depressing/hopeless mindset than I have right now, at least if I live physically like I do in my mind I’ll have a reason to be miserable. I have no reason to be miserable/numb right now, I just am. Maybe it’s normal. Don’t know, don’t care. 

Nothing I do makes me feel proud or happy for more than a few hours so I fail to see why I need a rent free house or no responsibilities. They don’t make me remotely happy so why bother with them really. Talking to people is tiring now and I really honestly don’t do much. I at least want to be independent and not live under my parents, afraid to spend money because it won’t come back. I can’t even trust my own words or actions anymore, it’s like I’m hollow and I don’t have full control. At least if I manage to live independently I’ll have something. It’s so small but it’s something I can hold onto to prove to myself that I’m not totally helpless.

I want to be a writer. That’s the big dream, so I’ll focus on that. I’ll go to work, read when I can, I’ll come back and write. Maybe on the weekends I’ll go out with friends. I don’t seem to enjoy life much regardless of what’s happening to me right now but I want to feel something strong that isn’t hopelessness. If that’s sadness then so be it. It’ll probably get better soon, nothing lasts forever as they say.

That might’ve turned into a rant. Not sure what it was supposed to be. Maybe asking for advice on how to go about it, if it’s a half decent idea (probably not). I don’t know, it’s more of a rant, feel free to ignore. Unless you’ve felt the same way with this weird self destruct thing, don’t ignore then.

I have no friends and never have. I was alone in high school. I was alone in college. I was alone in grad school. I've been alone since then too. Basically no one other than my parents ever talks to me or asks about me.

I have no professional successes to speak of. I work a shitty job that I'll be out of in a few months as the place I work is closing. I've never made more than $50K/yr in my life.

,depression,"From the overflow of the heart,


You reach and reach with no avail. You give and give until you are empty. You strive to find purpose, yet in your search, you exhaust yourself completely. In one moment you are cared for; every other moment, you are forgotten. You are mistaken by others, for it is easier to judge than to love another. And the love you do have is nothing but fleeting words—never actions. The things you once looked forward to now sour and make you ill. And you bleed and bleed to find help, yet soon enough, help itself becomes distasteful—a voided husk of repeated answers to weigh one down. Answers often unsolicited, laced in pride and ignorance. For once others learn what help means for you, they realize they can't or won't help. 

You speak and speak and speak, yet no words come out. No one hears you. As the tree that falls in the forest does not make a sound, you also do not exist. You ask and ask, and ask—you ask for one thing. Yet no matter how many times you ask, God is slow to answer and is preoccupied. All together, you have become seemingly voiceless. A silence that eats itself out of spite. A screaming in  the depths of a shallow sea. 


The only time you are seen is when you are drastic—and even then, in your cries for help, you are labelled by those unable to truly understand your affliction. Only leaving a greater mess than that was before. Leading you to be even more shut-in; more hidden due to fear and misconstrue. Finally forming within you, a facade so convincing, so realistic; a facade bent on preventing others from seeing the actual you—and seeing your hurt. An act so real, that even you deceive yourself into thinking you are okay, that there is nothing wrong.

Giving into an act of isolation through a fictitious front. Where loneliness becomes so apparent, so consuming. Creating into oneself a vicious desperation to belong and to be wanted. Where any rejection makes the thought of being under a knife admirable.  Where cosmetics become a way to love oneself, a mask to hide in. Where talents become not shows of passion but a currency for buying affection. Where looks and skills question, proclaiming ""Would you want me if I were this?"" A loneliness to motivate an endless toil to belong—to be seen—to be loved. A loneliness to take all warmth. A loneliness so deeply ingrained that it starts to shape and define you.

And when it all gets to be too much again. With this repetitious fall and climb into insanity, a trying insanity being your only sanity. When you get to the edge. With these forgotten fragments of script; these torn-up pieces of yourself. When it seems the Reaper opens a welcoming embrace to you. Gripped by a crushed spirit. With thoughts that used to torment that now comfort. You become faced with a truly terrifying decision, an utterly terrifying unknown.

A decision into an unknown more unknown than any other—that stiffens one step, that saps one strength. An unknown that drains dreams and desire from one's very being, very soul. An unknown that takes all. And faced with this terror, with dread stalling movements forward and memory siphoning all power left to escape, you become trapped. Imprisoned between the lines of destruction and hopelessness. Glued to a perpetuating suffocating misery. Snared by a loop of a self brought about hell in the inability to complete a task. Forced to suffer a slow death due to the fear of death itself. 

 And the more you try to run from this despair, the closer it gets. If you stand still, it still overtakes you. What can you do? Though you fight for better days, what can you do? And if only the heart was a bottomless well, then it wouldn't overflow into writing. Yet it seems bottomless because the heart is still longing. ",t2_9d6wpzte,False,,0,False,"I wanted to share this.
