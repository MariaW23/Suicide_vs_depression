"Feels like I’m getting closer, day by day","I feel like this is probably just as much a release and hopefully helps me let out a lot of tension I have inside me. 

I have a history of suicide, I tried when I was 14 and failed (which is quite ironic because I was doing it because I felt like a failure). I’m 26 now and the feelings have got stronger and stronger day by day. 

It’s hard to explain because on paper I’m very fortunate. I’ve got a good job, I’ve got mostly a good lifestyle and I live one of the best cities in the world. Butttt.. I hate myself, I hate everything about myself outside of the situation I’m in. 

I hate my skin colour, it makes me feel like an outsider in my own country, with my own friends. I’ve been brought up in a society that I believe thinks being white is better and that’s more so drilled into me and my thinking. So many people saying oh you aren’t British, no no where are you really from. 

My dad left my family when I was young. Which I think is pretty common but it’s the lack of effort he tried with me. His only communications with me, if we can even classify it as that, was to goad my mother. 

My last girlfriend told me she doesn’t love me and felt like she never could. That shit cut me so deep, I felt unlovable and even when asking to explain it she said she didn’t know, but I was so nice she wanted to try.

My mum has always put the pressure on me to perform and whilst that has meant I’ve achieved a lot of academic success. I will always look for the negative in myself or the situation because that’s how it’s always been for me. My mum would always point out my weak points to prove. 

I can pinpoint all the things that I don’t like about myself and where they stem from, and yes I’ve tried therapy, I’ve tried medication too. They just don’t seem to subdue or get better.

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Hating myself and depression in relation to performance and mindset,"Why does hating myself and depression help me perform better in all areas of life. Hating myself gives me a reason to improve myself and helps me look at myself more objectively and value myself and tasks etc to 1s and 0s. My weight loss and gym journey has become significantly better. I track macros pretty casually. Locked in at university and grades are improving, my gym sessions are more intense. Less shy around strangers, friends, work colleagues, my superiors.(i just treat everyone equally). My social and professional life is improving( It was decent before). 
But here comes the problem, with progression should come a sense of fulfillment.Instead i still feel like something is lacking. I still desire more hatred as i feel like it will push me more but where do i stop. I have come to understand from my friends, family and etc that i devalue myself too much( i think of myself as worth nothing ), take too many risks and am low-key self destructive. Apparently it is a sign of depression but at the same time it helps me get the mindset of  because I’m worth nothing, everything is a gain from this point. 
My point of this text is though things are getting better why do i feel lacking, and why do i keep craving more self hatred. Why don’t i think more positively like others and look for more optimistic ways of self improvement. Things being good makes me feel stagnant. I even miss a certain level of chaos in my life. I just need a fresh perspective that can help me navigate through whatever this is.

Running out of steam.,"Just kind of feeling the need to vent here... I don't really feel any motivation anymore. I'm 31M. Have an okay job but am by no means wealthy. I have savings but can't afford a house and probably never will be able to. I've never been in a relationship and am starting to accept that I probably never will be in love. I don't really feel motivation towards anything in my life anymore. I go to work, am generally bored by my job and sit there for 8 hours waiting to go home most days.

I then get home, have no real motivation to do anything, and effectively sit there waiting to go back to work the following day.

I think that I've been depressed on some level for about 75% of my life, or at least since I was a teenager. Most of the time i've felt that some change in my life would make things better... ""When I get the new job I'll feel better."" or ""When I move I'll feel better."" or ""When I find a girlfriend I'll feel better.""

I'm starting to realize that none of those things ever really change anything. I recently got a new job, moved to a new city. I thought I would feel much better. I don't. There's almost always been some light at the tunnel that I convinced myself would make me feel better, but I've realized that my depression never goes away. I'm genuinely unsure if I'm capable of sustained happiness.

Even if I felt there was another light at the end of the tunnel/carrot on a stick to chase, I think its unlikely that my life will improve much from here. I don't think wealth or relationships are really in the cards for me. My life will likely continue to be a cycle of working a boring 9-5 and coming home to a boring/lonely apartment.

On top of those feelings, the world itself is so bleak to me. I feel that as a civilization and species, we're hopeless. I think we've reached a point where technological advances are actually a net negative for human happiness/fulfillment, but those advances are impossible to stop or reverse. Politically, I think the US is completely fucked. Both parties are corrupt and on some level or another just serving the interests of the ultra rich and elite at the expense of the 99%. I don't think that these problems are fixable either. The elites have managed to create alignment with the poor. Your 401ks are tied to the value of their companies. Your home valuation is skyrocketing because their corporations are buying up single-family homes across the country. If you want your bread crumb, you better hope they get their feast.

I just find life so depressing both on a personal level and when I look at society as a whole. I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately but I refuse to kill myself while my mom is alive because it would completely destroy her and thats about the only thing I care about anymore...

Again just felt the need to vent. I'll probably go see a therapist or psychiatrist soon and maybe that will be helpful.",Hot_Competition724,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4zfur/running_out_of_steam/

Yesterday evening I told myself, tomorrow would be the day. This morning I was supposed to slit my wrists. Not sure what the plan was after that. Either call the emergency number myself or have my mom help. 

Well, I did it, kinda. Not enough to seriously hurt me though. 

I just can't get it out of my head, and everyday I'm in a constant debate whether I should do it or not. 

What I absolutely do not want though, is to get the rest of my family involved in this, and Gods those social workers. No offense, they're just doing their jobs, but I seriously cannot deal with those people anymore and I can already imagine the conversations. Also a mental hospital sounds absolutely miserable. 

Then, make it look like an accident? Be hit by a car? I frequently go out, it wouldn't be strange for me to wound up in an accident at all. But that'd hurt damn bad, and the chance of me dying would be bigger.

These thoughts are horrible and I've had them for so long, but never have I been so close to actually following them as I am now. I just *cannot* live like this anymore. I am so goddamn miserable everyday and no one can do anything about it.

So much therapy, so much different medication, so much ""how does that make you feel?"", so much being forced to look into my future when I don't see anything there, and *none* of it has helped in the slighest. I'm done, I need a break. 

I can't talk about this with my mom, it'd make her so concerned and she already has too much stuff going on, in general I just cannot seem to talk about anything like this face to face with someone, and I'd be scared a therapist would put me in a mental hospital. And frankly, 'talking about it' has just never helped for me.

I'm a 17-year-old male and already want to take my life.,"I don't really know how to start this post or why I even came to this platform, but I've been feeling so trapped and helpless over the past few months and wanted to share my situation. For some background, I'm a 17 year-old male, and my mind is essentially in a permanently blank, withdrawn, depersonalised and dissociative slate, like I'm watching my life as a movie, drifting through it on autopilot. Everything and everyone around me feels lifeless and foggy. I feel completely detached from my body and surroundings, as if I'm not really alive.

It's hard to explain, but everything feels disconnected and distant, like living in a permanent state of amnesia where I'm detached from my own body, lacking thoughts, memories, or a sense of identity, like an ego death that never ends. This has severely impacted my social abilities; I don't converse or speak with absolutely anyone at all. At college, I always stay by myself and avoid any social interaction. I'm incapable of having basic conversations because absolutely nothing is happening in my mind. I'm permanently zoned out, with nothing to say or express, and trying to find something to say is extremely difficult.

I can't explain anything about what I do at college because I'm zoned out and withdrawn the entire time I'm on campus, and I don't remember anything the next day. The only reason I'm doing relatively well is that I've been studying all the information at home. I'm essentially in a constant dream-like state and don't really think about anything. I don't speak at all. I cannot explain my situation to medical professionals; when I try, I just sit in silence, unable to convey my problems because I'm permanently zoned out. My mind is empty, and I'm entirely withdrawn. I feel crazy writing this. Am I going crazy? Am I going I mentally insane?

I feel so lost and alone. It took me a long time to write this Reddit post, and even as I typed, I felt withdrawn and can't really recall what I've talked about. I don't want to live like this anymore; it pains me to see people around me, reminding me of the life and self I can no longer get back.

I am extremely depressed and can't find joy in this life anymore. I have suicidal thoughts regularly. I do not want to continue this existence at all. I have absolutely nothing to say or express anymore. It gives me pain knowing this will probably be how I live for the next few years, and I can't bear the thought of living like this any longer.",Thomas_Cromwell1532,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4yngg/im_a_17yearold_male_and_already_want_to_take_my/
Hi ,"life is shit, I also feel like some of us really have it so much worse to go through the experience but I just want to say that everyone of us deserves love, even you ❤️


It sucks to be lonely every night, questioning if there’s anybody that actually cares, to just be here and feel lost everyday. Like everybody always wants to say they care about you but when the time comes when you need them It’s always just you alone

I just feel so terrible,"I am truly at my lowest emotional point of my life, I feel so terrible that I feel physically and mentally unable to do any of the things I enjoy, I cannot eat, I can barely drink water and just exist, I feel like I am barely able to pretend at my job, and its only a matter of time before someone notices how badly I am performing before there are consequences.

I have been speaking to my therapist a lot more often but now she is on vacation and it feels so difficult to wait here by myself.

I don't know why I am making this post because I feel nothing that anyone would tell me can help me, I know I am supposed to pick myself up and take care of myself, but it feels like the hardest thing to do is to exist and I feel powerless to do anything, I just felt the need to say this because I feel so terrible that I don't know what else I can do right now besides post my words somewhere

what’s the point,"i know someone if not all of y’all will tell me to just leave and be done with it but i cannot physically bring myself to do that yet so please, please don’t. “i know you said not to but you gotta leave” no i don’t want to hear that i just want to know that i’m not insane right now without being pressured into doing something like that, maybe i’ll be able to leave on my own.

that being said, my relationship with my SO is great, i love him a lot, he’s usually affectionate and appreciative of me.

but then he gets in these moods. he’s got depression that tends to come and go. when he’s depressed he blames me for every problem that HE caused in our relationship.

he cheated on me (if you can call it that, he stayed texting random bitches who live across the country from us) … we fought a LOT about it but stayed together. he’s shown me he’s sorry, and he’s the one who came out and told me about it on his own. i didn’t find it or nothing.

his problem with all that though is that i was “so angry” and when he’s depressed he says he thinks about it and can’t let it go. i understand that, i slapped him as hard as i could across the face. but fuck man, how would you respond?

oh, and the fact that his mom and family found out about this and hate ME??? not for the slap, i don’t know if they even know about it. because i was so angry at him even though i stayed with him. i was angry so i said a lot of hurtful shit. i get that. i fucked up.

but he always acts like we’re past it when he’s happy. couples go through shit, right?

i really have no purpose if not for him. all i do it work, cook food for him (i’ve realized that’s my love language) and try and help him with his dream career. he works a more physical job while working on his career on the side. the only chore i ask him to do is the dishes. we both are working now to save up money, he said once i’m pregnant and i can stop working if i want and he’ll provide. i’m happy with that.

but right now he’s in one of those depressed moods. and i’m feeling it right now too. more than normal. i know this will pass like every other time. but i’m so tired, man…

Hope. That's all I need.,"This post will be long because there is so much that is on my mind right now. Everything that is making me make plans to write suicide notes to my family and ending it are things completely out of my control. Here is some context: 

*  I live in the U.S. I am a young, disabled, Black college student. I live in a red state.
* I am nonbinary and AFAB.
* I do not have the money nor the means to leave the state or country before the election.

I know that a Trump presidency is inevitable. I feel like I will be hurt and abused by fascists. I feel like we are repeating history with Weimar Germany. Nobody in my family are really taking it seriously, believing that Biden will somehow pull through. I don't have faith in the two-party electoral system. I know Trump's base are more confident and rampant due to the attempted you-know-what. People have said this will earn him sympathy votes and that it is over. People constantly say stuff like ""We are cooked."" Other people say, ""Get to know your neighbors and join local community!"" but fascism is fascism. We live in an interconnected age where information is readily apparent and our digital footprints are at the fingertips of authorities. Maybe joining your local community was a viable option to those who stood up against fascist forces in the past, but now, we have better technology, better tracking, and more. Local community can't fix this. I can't fix this. There is nothing I can do but wait for the inevitable fascist to come to my house, abuse me, and end me. So I feel, why not end it myself? I know my family will miss me and it pains me and makes me cry every time I think of their tears. It would be devastating for them, but honestly with the way things are going, they will join me if a white supremacist fascist theocracy takes hold. I tell myself, ""Maybe the physical world is not meant for me, and there is some afterlife that I can enjoy instead. If I stop seeing death as the end, it will be easier. After all, my death ultimately won't change anything and billions of humans have died. What makes me special?"" I don't know. I have no hope. People say they live out of spite. I cannot do it. I want something to look forward to. I'm a planner. I can't go on without structure and reassurance and the ugly foundation of U.S. bigotry is giving me more reassurance that there is no hope. The Earth is dying too. I can only wish that those who wanted fascism but who are not rich and powerful enough to be sheltered from climate fallout and fascist in-fighting see the errors of their ways and foolishness of their actions, as fascism and capitalism are unsustainable.

I struggle with dissatisfaction with life and hating myself,"I live in a constant state of dissatisfaction, regret, envy, and self-loathing. 
 
People think I’m exaggerating when I say this but there is truly nothing I like about myself. I don’t like how I look. I don’t like how I sound. I don’t like how my mind works.

I hate how pathetic I am, how stupid I am. I’ve become everything I look down on. I have no accomplishments. No medals. Sure life isn’t about medals but they are to me. To be praised, to be envied, to be held in high regard. I envy my athletic classmates all the time. It’s too late for me to be a prodigy. I’m not good at anything. Anything I’m remotely decent doing is clouded by the fact that it will never give me what I want and I would trade it any day for something else. 

I want nothing out of life. I hate nature. I hate the rain. Hate the sun. I hate when people think that I should care about losing these things. There’s nothing I like that isn’t tied to being a consumer. I am materialistic at heart and I don’t plan on changing my ways. I consume what I can afford and dream about consuming things that are expensive. But even that will never fill the hole I feel where there should be a zest for living.

I don’t care. I can only see life going down from here (shitty college and generally not motivation to get out of bed). Yeah yeah life isn’t about where you go or whatever. We all hear it. But for someone like me, these things are important. I believe people are measured by their achievements and success. I believe that life is linear. You do this, you do that, and you do it well. 

Everywhere I look, I’m dissatisfied with how things work and look down on everything including myself. I hate and look down on this country. I look down on my school. I look down on my family and friends. I look down on the bad things happening in the world.

Sure, some might venture to say that it’s this dissatisfaction with the world that makes it my calling to change it or fucking something. But there is nothing and no one I look down on more than myself. It’s not just my circumstances I despise, it’s me. I am disgusted with myself. 

The answer is simple right? Just change then. Some would say. But I can’t change. I don’t want to. I will remain in this cycle. Because it’s not my actions I hate (though it’s also a part of it). It’s my person. I hate the person I am at my very core. I hate how I squirm when my wrongdoings are held in front of me like a child caught in a lie, with my mouth open like a fish. I hate how people see right through me. I hate how I pretend to be smarter than I really am but if you really quiz me, I know nothing. I don’t have the answers. I’m not interesting. 

The only things I don’t hate and I think are worth looking at are the things that make me envious. And when I envy, my stomach is twisted into a knot and I feel nauseous. I’m constantly jealous. But I don’t plan on removing the things that make me jealous because I deserve to feel jealous. It’s torture seeing the people have what I want, do what I want to do, receive worldwide recognition, being beautiful. Say what you want about taking a break from social media but you don’t understand how much I need to see it. It makes me despise myself even more than I really did. I keep a compilation of these things and dedicate a self-inflicted, mental torture session sometimes. 

Everywhere I look, I see no reason to give it my time of day. I see no reason to live. I hate everything. It seems childish but at its core, I hate everything. Everyday, I wake up cursing because I have to go through this again. The dissatisfaction. The envy. 

I want to die and I’m tired. I know I’m the problem. But I don’t care.

Are there any alternatives?,"Almost all sources of happiness for me are gone, and those left became self-destructive because I abused them too much. My current and future circumstances as of now (3, 4 years) won't be different unless I change my habits. But since I can't do what makes me happy, I can't keep up with the short-term constructive lifestyle alterations. There's just no purpose behind it all. I'm the only one who can give meaning to life, and I fail to do so ever since. But earlier I had the things that brought me joy at least. 

Suicide is the epitome of egoism, and if I went through with it, I'd definitely destroy the lives of my parents. And I'm not selfish to that extreme.

i understand that this isn't like doctors diagnosis or anything, this is reddit for goodness sakes. i just wanna hear like public opinion 

so couple things:
a. i lost passion in things i used to love (reason being i'm not good enough)
b. too lazy/no motivation or drive to even try to get good at the things i say i'm not good enough at

1. i hate my friends all of a sudden. (Not all of a sudden it's been a gradual climb. it's just like all their little quirks just set me off. i can't handle their entire personality) 
i have been friends with them for a while so maybe i just grew out of them? 
2. i kinda am disliking my family. not my family, just my siblings. (i'm the youngest and all my siblings are highly accomplished so i have a big gap to fill in. i feel like i have no personality and only my older siblings exist. i just hate how i'm constantly compared to my siblings and have nothing that they can compare to. I DONT HATE MY SIBLINGS. i hate that i get compared to them)
maybe all normal siblings hate each other? also maybe it's an inferiority complex thing idk. 
3. i really just hate myself for being all these things. (I feel like i have no true reason to hate any of my friends or siblings. they all are great people but for some reason i can't handle them. I just don't understand why i hate them so violently. it just makes me feel like a disgusting shitty horrible person.)
is this depression or just like me being an unreasonably bad dude?

I constantly live in the past and relive through my trauma every single day to the point that i can no longer take care of myself. i've been depressed for years and started self harming a decade ago, at 11 years old. i've been waiting for it to get better but it just seems to get worse. i've tried every single medication from SSRIS to mood stabilizers to antipsychotics to benzos to self medication with psychedelics and weed. The only thing that helped with the suicidal thoughts was the psychedelics for a few years but they turned into a dependency and i would not like to try them again.

Feeling so empty and confused,"I spent most of my teenage years suffering from extreme depression and anxiety, though I have improved, I still sometimes find myself regressing back to my old habits. I have diagnosed borderline personality disorder along with endometriosis and Autism. With those along with my past trauma, I never really know why im feeling depressed or how to fix it in the moment. I am currently finishing up my bachelors degree and starting work on my Masters in 2025. This summer I have been feeling extreme burn out and just feelings of helplessness. I dont really have friends in my home town so I spend majority of my summer alone in the house. Some days I find myself waking up and not leaving my bed until 6-9 hours of the day have passed. The end of the summer semester is approaching and ive been struggling with school work due to lack of motivation and other things, the guilt from falling behind is also getting to me as well. My boyfriend is amazing, but he has a lot of mental issues as well and its hard for me to open up to him because I know he is fighting his own battles right now and as much as I love him, he has never been as invested as our relationship as I have so I fear that if I start asking for help too much he will decide its for the best for us to split up.

Severe depression treatment: did you have a super feel good phase?,"I am in my thirties and was diagnosed with severe depression on december, 2023. What broke me and made me go to the psychiatrist was that my ideation day failed, not for mental reasons. I couldn't work, eat and for the first time in my life I felt lonely.

I am on meds since then. In march I felt really good, never in my whole life I felt so good, could think better, talk better, could describe if food was good or bad, and for the first time I had a moment in my life that I could describe as happiness. I was able to go do lots of exams (bloos test), everything is good. Walked for 4 hours in one day. Wrapped a birthday gift for my best friend. Could describe how good or bad a food was, never been a picky eater. Went out with all my friends. Was able to do 6 sets of all my workout routine everyday in 1 hour, 12 exercises divided in 3 supersets. Cleaning my whole house was easy.

The best expression to explain it was cloud nine.

One month later, things got worse again. Less energy, harder to concentrate and think, harder to do basic things, crying more, went to 6 sets everyday to 3 sets and then 1, and somedays I wasn't able to workout. I go out with my friends and feel nothing, on that stage that no one wants to see that I am not good, so I just pretend that things are okay.

Doctor increased meds and changed to ""stronger"" and expensive meds. It has been 3 months and It didn't get better. Some weeks ago someone recomended L Citrulline and helped a bit, but not extraordinary.

I am losing my hope, I feel that the ""feel good phase"" wasn't normal and I will never experience it again. I am currently off work since december, not receiving any money from my country social service. I will run out of money in some months, and planing a date again.

I am posting this because in my lurking experience here and on other social medias, I have never seen anyone describe that feel good moment that lasted only days or weeks.

I know that people like to say that it will get better and that I am still on the beginning of my treatment, I am here to read this.

Please be honest, if you have severe depression, did you had this experience? Were you able to feel that again?

dead end venting,"Throwaway but I'm hitting 30(M) in a bit and I legitimately feel like I've hit a complete dead end in my life.

Lost my job two years back and been living off savings since - I had a pretty senior gig and I was essentially at the top of my peers but after losing it, it's hard to climb back to anywhere decent. But that's just the normie stuff, let's deep dive into the misery well for a bit while I allow myself some self-pity.

Since my teens, I've been suffering from unending headaches/migraines. Untreatable, and non-diagnosable. I wake up to pain, and I fall asleep to pain - my sleep is never rested because of this, and I've come to realise that I genuinely don't know what a good sleep actually is, after over a decade of this. I simply sleep for the physical benefits, but my mental has never benefitted from the process. The worst bit about the headaches, is that it chronically cripples me - it's hard to work out without it coming back to bite me and leave me unable to operate.

I moved back in during the pandemic, only to find that my dad has become a shell of himself due to a mix of dementia and Parkinson's - so it feels like part of my life has been lost due to a feeling of my mum needing me to be around to help out. I personally think the burnout from the sudden need to be a caregiver and juggling my job led to losing my gig, but it's whatever.

I can't find the motivation to do anything anymore. The fatigue, the headaches, the idea that I've become hopeless - it's all coalescing and I guess I needed to just write this all out and send it to the universe, even if it amounts to nothing.

At this point, I legitimately think I've given up. I exist to serve others, even the idea of offing myself is trapped by the idea that everyone would be burdened by it. I have friends, sure, but who would want to listen to all this. They know bits and pieces but I generally am rather high-functioning so it's under covers for most of my life. Quite sure a lot of people would be freaked if they saw the true depths of my despair.

"I have no friends, no family, &amp; I think I have herpes. Thinking about quietly running away and ending it. ","I \[27F\] have been no-contact with my family for four years. There is not a single person in my family (not even a distant cousin) who I talk to. I also have no friends because I have social anxiety and come off as cold/distant. I have tried to make friends many times with little success. 

My depression and longing to be desired has gotten to a point where I've started going to bars alone and hooking up with random men. I started doing this two months ago and have slept with three people. 

Today, I had to go get an STD test because I have been having symptoms of herpes. I don't have my results back yet but I am 99% sure I have it. 

I feel like a waste of space and as if my life has no purpose. My family wants nothing to do with me, nobody wants to be my friend, and I don't bring anything positive to this planet. I am a stupid, diseased slut. 

My last hope was finding a relationship, but I've pretty much blown that by catching this disease. My dating pool has been reduced by 90%. All because I was depressed which led me to make stupid, impulsive decisions.

I'd rather let myself wither and rot than asking for help.,"I don't know why life is the way that it is now, however I feel it just leads to nowhere.

I remember people asking me when I was younger: ""How do you imagine yourself in 10 years?"".

I don't fucking know, maybe struck by a car? Maybe in a storm so bad it damaged my car and part of my apartment? Because that is what happened in 10 years and sincerely I did not want that in my life.

Hope is stupid and bliss is anything but permanent.

Bad shit happens and sincerely I can't muster any strength to see myself in a better light.

My electrical meatball is malfunctioning again,"I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience to me. Does it get better? What helped you through the seemingly downward spiral? 

A few background things: I stopped taking my medication at the end of May. I stopped cold turkey (I know I shouldn't have, but I didn't want to stop during the school year as a teacher and deal with withdrawal symptoms). My doctor had me on 20mg Lexapro for a year and a half. I was also on 150 mg of Welbutrin for a time to curb side effects, but I stopped that way before May. Part of the reason I stopped both is because I kept forgetting to take them regularly, anyway. 

The first week or so, I was just irritated and felt kind of nauseous. I felt fine for the next 2-3 weeks and slowly, my depression symptoms have been creeping back in.

I am now at the point where I have a hard time even mustering up enough energy to eat something for most of the day, even when I'm hungry. I can't get anything done around the house unless I break into my reserve energy vault that leaves me exhausted. I really could sleep all day, every single day. I'm just so overwhelmed and have no real coping strategies to rely on at this point because getting out of bed or off the couch is so, so difficult. 

Thanks in advance, and I'm sending love and comfort (even if you can't relate or don't respond to this) 💕",kmilan99,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2570g/my_electrical_meatball_is_malfunctioning_again/
"No plans to do it, but man, I probably have good enough reason as any","So buckle in, this might get long.

44m

I relocated to Memphis TN last year for work from Nee Orleans LA. As soon as I set foot in this place, I kinda knew it wasn't for me - was not happy, but the work was good and I decided it would have to grow on me. I had came up BRIEFLY for a few weeks over the summer to get the transition lined up and made the permanent relocation in October.

So while I was on my temp summer jaunt, I went out for my birthday by myself to this little beer and pizza joint. There was this server who was absolutely beautiful - she wasn't MY server, but she kept making excuses to come by my table to talk. She was enchanting. She awkwardly spilled a bit of water on me and we laughed. After I left I thought little of it.

So then I move to the area permanently, find a local dive bar... and she is there. Still beautiful. She approaches me, we reconnect. Long story short, we very quickly fall in love.

She is my life. Everything she does is musical and magical. She doesn't even drink (always DD for her drunk sister, thus why at the bar) and tells me she decided to quit when she realized she didn't handle alcohol well. I respect it and tell her I'm haply to quit myself, or at least never do it around her - all she needs do is tell me, she's totally worth it. She tells me not to worry about it.

She moves in with me. I could not be happier.

We go out for dinner one night, she tells me she thinks she's in a good place to casually drink again. I tell her only she can make that decision, just make sure she feels right about it. Now here it gets a little weird, because I remember thinking ""this could be the start of bad things"" but I tried to push it out of my head.

Her drinking doesn't seem troublesome - for a while at least.

She winds up getting a job bartenders at the same dive we met in. She's excited and I support it, since the money is good, she wants to do it, and the location is super convenient. Another time when I wish I would have realized then that this was setting up for a massive failure later....

Slowly, her focus becomes more on staying out all night drinking than on anything else. I still do not suspect infidelity at all, as she would be extremely open about her activities, just staying out all night getting incredibly drunk and stumbling in 4-6am most nights. I work a high stress day job, but I tried to adjust the best I could.

Now she had always made no secret that she wanted to marry. And we had talked about it in detail and I wanted it as much if not more than her. She knew a proposal was coming soon and appeared to be thrilled about it.

So I booked the hotel for a week in New Orleans over July 4th, told her we would take a week so I could bring her to my hometown and show her where I come from (she had never been). I planned on proposing in front of St Louis Cathedral during the July 4th fireworks over the river. My plan was BARELY a secret. She essentially knew I was proposing. Again she was on cloud 9.

The Friday before we are scheduled to leave, she wants to go to Beale st to go out with me. I am somewhat reluctant (more concerned with the upcoming trip in 4 days) but I decide to take her out per request anyhow.

Then night falls apart.

She gets black out drunk. She mouths off to some Memphis police and almost gets us arrested. I tell her we have to go home because the cops are seriously considering taking us in because of her behavior. She unleashes hell on me. Calls me worthless. A failure. A piece of shit. She tries to get the streetcar co doctor not to let me on the car.... screams vulgarity at me in front of the other riders. She almost falls off the car when it stops and myself and a bystander catch her so she doesn't hurt herself. ""Get your fuckin hands off me"".

I tell her ""I can't fuckin do this. I can't marry this"".

She tries to swing on me several times in the middle of the street. 

I call her coworkers/bar buddies and tell them to come pick her up and I wait around the corner to ensure she's safe, then take an uber home.

They take her back to the bar and keep feeding her liquor. She comes in at sunup unintelligible drunk and passes out.

We try to talk that morning, she doesn't remember anything, but tells me I'm a monster for leaving her ""alone"" (I was still there till she left) downtown drunk and defenseless. I ask her where do we go from here - that this is her one chance to tell me what she wants, and I'll do it.

She chooses to avoid accountability and just berate me.

I go to New Orleans alone for the week.

It's horrible. I just sit on the river, stare at the barges and the bridge, and quietly drink by myself.

I return 2 weeks later, she's still at the house. I try to talk to her one more time, she avoids talking/accountability completely. I finally tell her we are over. She goes to work/late night drinking/whatever and STILL keeps coming to the house when she needs to. I finally tell her to not come back unless it's to get her personal belongings. 

....they're still here.

I return to work today after 2 weeks (my work knew about the proposal plans AND the complete failure that followed). I have to face all these people looking at me like I'm a broken wretch that is just waiting for the right moment to swan dive off the fuckin bridge.

It's awkward and humiliating.

I get to our job site. Discover that several of my coworkers actively despise me (by their own words). 

I am now stuck in this town that I never wanted to be in, lovelier than I have ever felt in my life, surrounded by shit that reminds me of her, just waiting till this lease expires and I can move back home to New Orleans.

I literally have no one here now. It is the coldest feeling I have ever experienced in my life. The only thing that keeps me holding on is that I know I'll be back home for Mardi Gras.

Help me please,"Hello everyone I came here to ask for advice on what to do about my parent’s marital problems. My mom recently found out that my father has been seeing another woman, I already knew this a long time ago but I didn’t know what to do I was afraid to tell my mother because I know it would hurt her and I was still young at that time. My father has been a responsible father, he provided us food, a great house, he spoilt us with many gifts and gives us decent amount of money, but I think it’s really painful for my mother because she was trying to do her best to become a good wife, she provided him love and support but he just ignores it. I’m gonna leave for college because I’ll be studying at another region about 1000km, I am really excited to leave because I felt that staying in our house was really intoxicating, my mom would always compare me to my older sister, she would always remind me that I am different than my classmates, (I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder) she keeps telling me that I should really be organized and responsible which made me felt incapable of doing and achieving higher dreams since I am being constantly reminded that I can’t do it cause I’m different, she also has her favors on my sister, she always prioritize my sister and praise how good she is and that I should be like her, I tried to be like her once, I remember during my 8th grade I really worked hard to achieve with high honors because I always saw them really proud at my sister, my father even wears his uniform on the stage(he’s a police officer) but at the time of my recognition, nobody came, so I told my teacher I wasn’t feeling well and left, even at my high school graduation I felt really bad cause I asked them to come for my graduation it was only about 4 hours but my father left early and my mother was in a hurry, she keeps calling me that we should go home but I told her if she could wait for a moment cause I was still taking pictures with my classmates whom I would be leaving cause I’ll be studying in another region but she left anyways. I really envied how the other parents hold their children with pride in their eyes. In my sister’s graduation my father took 4 days off to come visit my sister, my mother was prouder than ever, I kept asking myself my graduation only lasted 4 hours and they even couldn’t wait for me, what is it that my sister have and I don’t? It really hurts me how they give so much importance at my sister but I guess she deserves it cause she’s smart, brave and confident and I think it’s because she was born first, my mother would always tell me that I should respect and prioritize her, I remember we transferred to our new house, me and my sister picked the same room but it was given to her cause she was the eldest and naturally eldest gets whats the best, my sister was leaving to study at another region in a few months but I didn’t argue cause younger siblings should always submit and respect their parents and older sibling/s. I didn’t hate them for that though, I was still grateful that I have a roof under my head, I have food at the table and I was able to study. Now that I’m in college I’m ready to leave and chase my dreams but I worry about my mother what if she and my father would fight, she would be all alone and I can’t let that happen, I know how it feels to be alone, to succumb in a dark place where everthing feels useless and pointless to the extent that you just want to end it all. So please help me, tell me what to do, do I follow my dreams and study at another region where I could heal myself? or should I stay and with my mother so that she could heal herself?",Remote_Seat6047,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1is2y/help_me_please/
Stressed,"Hey everyone, i’m a 22f and i’m really struggling either way accepting my fate.

Am I in Crisis?,"I have other reddit accounts but need to post this under this account because quite frankly the name fits how I feel. This is long, but context, I wrote this right now after the thoughts and actions of last night.

Looking back, I think I was having a mental health crisis last night. For some reason, at dinner, I felt a wash of calmness come over me about my life. This calmness is **not** the type of calmness someone should have. 

I thought “maybe if I just go to sleep, the thoughts won’t be as prevalent”. Then I woke up in the middle of the night with these thoughts in my head the loudest they’ve ever been. Then I bargained with myself “If you write them down, then they are real, and you need help. If you don’t write them down; you’ll be ok.” Finally, the voice was so loud I had no choice. I started to write from 4-7AM I was research and preparing.

When my sister died, we had a terrible time finding all her accounts and contacting her friends. 

Last night I took multiple steps in preparation.

·      Made a sheet with all my important account logins (with instructions on specific logins to make sure they don’t cancel things like my cell phone before all those are completed)

·      Located the deed to the house (at least I think it’s the deed)

·      Turned off things like two factor authentication on accounts wherever possible and FaceID

·      Confirmed the beneficiaries of my employer life insurance policies? (Did you know that some policies through your employer only allow you to change your beneficiaries during either a life event or open enrollment?)

·      Tried to confirm if self-extermination would still pay out the above (in general policies apparently do after 2-3 years of being written – always check your specific policy though)

·      What contact they should let know that I self-committed.

In addition to the above, I even started to do one of those online wills. But then I realized the following.

·      I need two people to sign my will. Who could I get to sign this without setting off alarm bells.

·      Would my last will and testament even be valid when it was created in crisis?

Then finally I started writing a letter to my mom. It wasn’t a letter explaining why I did the irreversible; but why I felt this way and how I promised her if I ever felt this way, I would seek emergency help. Then I questioned myself, ""Am I really at that point""?

I then decided to find a better definition of what it means to be in a mental health crisis. Does thinking about self-extermination make a crisis? If so, I’ve been in one for years with varying intensity. Does preparing for the logistics of post expiration make a crisis? We all know that if someone attempts self-extermination they are in crisis. But what about before that? How do you recognize that you, yourself, in that moment, are in crisis and need help but don't have a fully thought out plan?

By this time, it was about 7AM. I decided that I am unable to work today and e-mailed my boss such. I almost slept on the floor of my bathroom because it is the only room that I could make completely dark to match how I felt. However, I did not go that far. I just kept the ac at the temp I normally sleep in and cocooned myself in my blanket in a tightness I have never done before and slept. If I woke up, I would just lay in my cocoon till I would fall asleep again. I kept doing this till now, 1500 US eastern.

I am telling myself I am writing this because I am unsure I need help, and I think I may have to go at least on a 72-hour hold, but because for me 

·      I am unsure I was or even still am in crisis

·      I bargained with myself that if they I can push a little harder and wait a little while longer; the feelings will go away, and then can try and just get through life.

The feelings aren’t going away, they may become subdued; but they do flare back. Even in this moment, as I close out this, I still wonder if I am crisis and need to seek emergency help. The scary thing is what they will do to me, and how at that point, I will truly feel like I have failed at life.

Maybe I’ll stop barging with myself and go; maybe I won’t and just try and push it down again, hoping it doesn’t come back worse because; today…I fear by doing what I did above; I have made it 1000% times easier for me to go even further the next time these thoughts come around.",ThinkImInCrisis,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e43873/am_i_in_crisis/
A popstar pushed me over the edge,"I’m 19 (trans fem, which is kind of relevant), and I’ve gone through life unhappy, constantly setting arbitrary goals thinking it’d help, but when I get there it feels the same. Anyways, a couple of weeks ago I tried listening to this singer that I’d heard a lot about, and I absolutely fell in love with her music. I spent two days straight listening to her stuff, and then I actually looked her up. She’s beautiful, she started at a young age, and she is unfathomably talented. In the span of a few minutes, all the joy I got from listening to her music melted into misery as I saw, for the first time ever, a life that actually appealed to me, that I knew I would almost certainly never reach, even if I dedicated every second of my life to it from now on. I have no idea why, honestly I’ve never been that jealous of celebrities before but this singer just broke me. I’ve been kind of on the edge for a while, but this stupid thing kind of finished me off. It’s been over two weeks of sadness and crushing envy now. I’m just exhausted, I really have to end it.

The funny part is, even if everything lines up perfectly and I somehow become the next big thing in the exact right way by the time I’m her age, I’d still feel unhappy. Everything just feels so unfair. Why couldn’t I have been born as somebody else? Somebody who was the right gender, someone pretty, with a little bit of talent and a family that encouraged her to do what made her happy, not what they could brag about to other rich assholes? It’s so frustrating that my brain works this way. With the conditions I was born into, I could easily live a well above average life, but that just wouldn’t be good enough for me, I have to live the exact life of one person out of over 8 billion to even have a remote chance at happiness. 

I just really want to kill myself so I can rest. Either I do it now, wait until the end of my young adulthood crushes the last little bit of my potential, or somehow through some massive series of miracles get to the life I want, realize I’m still unhappy, and probably kill myself anyways. The only reason I haven’t slit my wrists already is the delusional belief that there’s a tiny fraction of a decimal of a percent chance that I could do it with enough practice, money, and luck.

"I don't feel real, and I want to disappear.","I've recently turned 18 and I don't know what to do. For a while now, I've been catching myself in auto pilot, I'll be talking to someone and laughing and smiling, but inside, I'm spectating myself in third person, I know I don't care about the conversation and just want the day to end so I can be alone in my room. I'll usually just spend the rest of my day on Chai and listen to music to escape. I know I'm fucking up and making my life worse, but I'm at a impasse. I feel dejected from reality, I keep thinking to myself that I'm going to wake up, that this isn't real life. When I look in the mirror, I can't accept that I am myself, I feel separate from who I see, like I'm playing a character in a play or something. I'm stuck in the past, constantly longing to go back but suffering the pain of nostalgia. I want to go in the woods and be separate from all of this, I'm not really living for anything, I don't particularly have any plans for the future either, I just want to be seperate from my life. I wish I could just throw in the towel and say, ""Please, I'm done."" It's currently 3:02 a.m. I woke up from having to take a piss, but now I can't get back to sleep and I'm dreading having to go to work. I'm not sure what else to type, but I've been wondering if anyone else has felt similarly—that they don't feel real and will eventually wake up.",TheCoolestDaniel69,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4j6rx/i_dont_feel_real_and_i_want_to_disappear/

I don't know what to do ,"I posted this in r/therapy bci wanted help finding a therapist but a bot let a comment saying I should find resources here so I'm just going to copy and paste what I said.
I need to speak to a therapist or somthing, I've recently moved to seattlewith my husband to live with my mil (we are 23 and 24) and I've never been so depressed in my life, the only reason I haven't started hurting myself again is because my husband would see it, on thrusday I almost got hit by a bus my friend yanked me out of the way (i wasnt trying to get hit but i'm very blind and couldnt see the bus coming, also it was our turn to walk the bus flew through a red light), 3 other people were there and also almost got hit. whole the 3 of them were freaking out and on the phone with the cops (1 guy left after a few minutes) all I could think about is how much I wished it would've hit me so I wouldn't have to be here anymore. Me and my friend joked about getting isakaied afterwards but I really do wish that bus hit me. I don't think I'll do anything to actively end my life but if something comes my way I'm also not going to stop it. My husband has also been through alot in life whenever he'd upset he completely shuts down i have to beg him to text me what's wrong because he physically can't talk.

I'm losing hope in humanity and things just keep getting worse,"I just want to state I'm doing okay in terms of a place to work and a house to stay at. I'd say I'm dealing with less stress than the average person working in the US. The issue is I'm breaking mentally when I thought I overcame some of my biggest problems that held me down. I use to deal with a lot of depression and anxiety. It held me back horribly and I tormented myself In the past thinking how the way people treat me I must deserve to suffer. I thought that maybe I had done something so horrible in a past life that I absolutely deserved the hurtful things friends would do to me. I'd lay in night crying about how I would be better off if I had disappeared and the only thing that stopped me was not wanting to end my life just out right sense who knows where you go and what damage I would cause to people finding out I killed myself. Even my family treated me horrible as a kid I know I was not raised well. I wasn't raised horribly but I still went through stuff that caused me to develop how I felt about how I deserved to suffer. I know it was what caused my anxiety. Even back then when I expressed my severe panic attacks no one tried to help. They even found out I was cutting cause I tried getting help through a suicide hotline who just threw cops my way so I had to get cuffed and sent to a mental hospital. Explains why I don't go there for help anymore.

Of course I no longer face this exact challenge of hating myself. I actually have grown to accept the things I like and and who I am. I have bought things I like to look at like art and just stuff that would help me. Ultimately I begun taking care of myself and loving myself. With all of this it was very impowering I felt good about life. The last time I felt depression/anxiety was 5 months ago when my bestfriend who I talked to everyday for a year started ghosting me. She had moved back home and shortly after the energy we equally put in started halting. I gave it time thinking oh she just wants to be with family for a bit. A month passed. I had grown to hold a lot of anxiety and concern the friendship was ending. I expressed my feelings of how ever sense she moved back home I felt I wasn't someone she liked anymore. Like I was just used to pass the time she was away from home. I only received deflections and how my comment hurt her. I was just shocked.

What made all of this worse is I had just helped this friend get a new pc with a good amount of money. Money I was anxious to spend but there were no issues in the friendship prior. We always worked things out we always played games and did voice chat. When she needed someone to vent to I tried to be there for her. I gave her advice helped her away from bad friends. Showed her how to be more positive and get through work. I put so much into it and I loved it. That friend felt like a sister to me that I didn't have. Just like that though I was no longer even a thought to them. They said they would pay me back first. They ended up paying others back first. I asked them about it. They said how I told them they could take their time. I did. Though there was absolutely desire being shown to pay me back. 2-3 months in no money was given back. I was dying over this. I spent a year with this person almost daily sharing so much. Now I'm not only not worth talking to but I'm not even worth getting the money back that I so kindheartedly loaned. Remembering hearing how she looked up to me so much. Hearing how I helped so much. So I guess it wasn't meant at all. Or they liked my actions but not me as a person. Eventually I had looked into stuff and my mind switched. I was done treating myself bad over all the stuff that went wrong.

I started taking care of myself and buying things for myself. It honestly didn't feel as good but I know it was helping and after sometime I realized how horrible those close friends were to me. So I started trying to better determine my friends and started a goal of staying out of friendships that had drama. Anyone who I had issues with I put a long stick between us at the very least. This horrible event at least gave me room to treat myself better. Then it started. I started realizing how sickening it was for people to treat such a sweet person like that. To selfishly use me like that. Use me as a wallet. Use me for emotional validation. Use me to fill in their boredom. Most of the closest people hurt me the most. Said some of the most vial things I had heard. It all ended on such bad terms. It made me question if I should have anymore close friends. Shortly after someone who I considered a friend started trying to make me mad. I knew what they were doing cause they started instigating things. They even expressed how they were trying to instigate. I can't just leave this friend because a good friend hangout with him. I'd have to leave as a whole.

All of these little details all of these little actions that I saw in people. I saw how sickening we are as Humans. We steal from people who love us. We use them like tools. We do anything to make ourselves feel better even if it means someone dies. What was unbearable an amount of depression and anxiety is now an unbearable amounts of anger building up more and more. I knew how everyone close to me treated me so disgusting. No one sacrificed anything for me. No one did anything that was at their inconvenience. No one in this world wants to be understanding. No one wants to put in the same effort all the time. My friend group is getting smaller and smaller. I don't make anymore friends. So it just seems like a painful process of me losing all my friends in some disgusting way eventually and I'd have no way of know sense most just switched up on me. Where they take advantage of me or use me in any kind of way. Where at the end of it my health is never a concern to them. Its disgusting how much stuff I dealt with that was horrible as someone with such a big heart.

Now I don't know who to trust anymore. I don't know whos going to toy with me next. I know I can't make any friends not that I don't talk to people but because I'm such a different person from everyone else. My interests are niche and very few people ever know them. No one really gets my way of joking a lot and Im so spastic. I have a lot of energy and I just act dumb because its fun. I don't hate me for this but I know the way I am doesn't bring anyone in which as a human is making me feel very lonely. So while I'm losing people there is absolutely no one showing up in life. I'm growing up and I know less and less people will like my way of joking and interests. Its just saddening cause I use to love people and I wanted to give someone the most a human could. I wanted to experience true love. The closer I got to this it felt like life was stabbing me in the most painful way it could. People I thought I knew who lured me in only to use me and throw me away.

So despite wanting to love people and care for people and help I now Just feel so much disgust and hatred. I'm so full of anger and it gets worse everyday. I stay physically active to hopefully burn off this anger but I can still feel it there. Even if I manage to get it out of my mind during it comes back. Its just there. I'm so disgusted by what Human do. It feels like truly humanity was never full of love. It was never a place with good people. I just hate how no one cares. Whats the point. Whats my purpose. I just want to say fuck it and leave everything. I don't want to deal with this shit anymore. Getting close to someone just means a big chance at me getting screwed over in some way. I don't know how to feel or what to do now. everything is just feeling worse. I just feel like blowing my brains out. There is no good here. I won't even feel that happiness i did from friends in anything else and I've been trying. I want to be happy but I can't find anything to distract me away from this anger like those friendships did. I love my hobbies and interests but I'm not a fueled to them. At least when i do them yes I enjoy it but this anger comes back.

I'm so sick of it. Its tormenting. You think you make it into a peaceful happy life then either someone or life itself kicks you down as soon as you get better. I just don't want to be here anymore. Not even cause I hate myself. I actually want myself to be okay so just imagining ending it all being free from this painful headache. From all the sickening humans out there. That sounds lovely. Its sound like that would be the only thing I'd have to finally put my mind at rest. No more emotions that take over my life. It would be fine if I could be okay for a whole year without breaking down so bad like this. But i don't ever get that. Sense 13 my like has just felt like shit. I don't know how to feel anymore. Yeah maybe I can ride this out but ya know when you actively snap into a positive mindset finally and then anger comes along to kick it out. Well whats the point. All of that work is gone. Its obviously impacting my friendships and even work. I can't talk to people when the thought of blowing my head of is in my mind or when the crippling disgust of all the horrible things people have done to me is catching up. I'm just so annoyed now. I haven't hurt anyone but I've just stopped showing up. Only 2 fucking people would care about where I am and the other would be concerned about me.

Well I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't really have anyone to go to with this. Its funny I wanna give up on Humanity and stop relying on people but I'm here. I just want peace really. Also if anyone is concerned please don't have police show up again. That actually caused me to lose a lot of trust too. Maybe I'm just paranoid now cause how would they tap my stuff on here but whos knows. Just send the police to deal with the guy who needs comfort and care. I know it would be expecting a lot for some to read and respond sense nothing is ever really free but yeah. Well thanks if anyone does. I'm gonna lay down and hope I can swiftly fall asleep before it gets even worse.",Fluffy_Tax1711,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2qav2/im_losing_hope_in_humanity_and_things_just_keep/
I feel like running away to the country will fix me,"I'll just be surrounded by trees and cows and be happy. But I'm pretty sure being depressed is more complicated than that. But what if leaving everything behind truly fixes me? I love the people in my life. I just hate myself in my life. So if I have a different life I should be fixed right? 

I'm too much of a coward though. I don't want to make anyone sad. And I have no money to do so. How would this even work?

I don’t know what to do ,"
Warning: this post includes loads of triggers, please don’t read if it’ll hurt you. 
I apologise in advance; it’s quite long I thought I should provide context.!

So I (27F), just been told I’m the toxic one in my family. My little brother (19M) got tired of my shit and called me on it. I didn’t know. It was 3h ago, I’m having a breakdown/existential crisis/ realisation overload. 
It’s horrible. I don’t know what to do with myself. I called the suicide helpline. 
For a bit of context: I have several chronic illnesses, all of them quite painful, for the past 7 years. Monthly trips to the A&amp;E, daily hormones/painkillers/antidepressants, weekly appointments to Specialists Dr. It’s quite hard because I tried going to University and had to stop because of the pain, tried working and pain stopped me again , I can’t even be a reliable volunteer. I used to play the cello, and do ballet, and paint and draw, and read a lot, but the pain shakes and the medication makes it too hard now ( kids’Paint by number are too hard for me). 
On top of those chronic illnesses; I have to battle PTSD for multiple rapes, a psychologically abusive ex, medical malpractices, absent father, school bullying ( from preK to A levels), being sterile and daily pain. 
Not a surprise if I tell you I am depressed. 
And I thought the best thing to do was to just deal with all of that myself, to prove them I was independent and strong. Not to burden them because they already had their problems to deal with. 
But no. My brother in law gifted my sister a “how to deal with narcissists” book and I just realised it was about me. 
I had to move in with my mom ( parents going through a separation right now), because I wasn’t able to take care of myself on a daily basis (like food and showers and cleaning and groceries ect were too much). 
And I’ve been treating her like shit. I would be on the streets without her. 
And I thought I had the behaviour that conveyed my gratitude. That’s the worse part, it wasn’t on purpose. The pain gave me tunnel vision and I was so focused on one meal at a time, one step at a time.
They know me so badly they gifted me shelves for my birthday, and did party food ( crisps and mini toasts), because they don’t know my favourite foods. 
I thought I was masking my daily bad moods ( very hard to be happy when your one and unique thought is PAIN), but they were suffering. 
I treated my mum like a slave, I didn’t even say good mornings or thanks to all the chores she did for me. 
I knew I did something bad because she’s been retreating herself from me, leaving me to deal alone with my mess. 
3 days ago I had a flare up so bad I was immobilised and crying /yelling in pain for several hours. The neighbours got worried and called the cops and ambulance. They took me to the hospital and kept me for 3days to ran tests and control the pain. Apparently they came ( mum and brother)to my room and knocked to check up on me and I didn’t hear them. Now, my mum is angry at me because she was ashamed of having to deal with the cops.
A part of me is tired to be made the bad guy every time. If I go to my room to deal with my pain ( like at Christmas), I’m sulking and ignoring everyone. My mum says « to not check for non intentional consequences/ accidents of your actions, is doing it on purpose », basically if you cared you would have thought ahead if it would hurt anyone. So for her, all my hurting behaviour is on purpose. 
They always jump to the worst conclusion; I’m not in terrible pain for days; I’m just being moody and not replying to their texts. 
They don’t understand that I have nothing happening in my life for the past years except my illnesses. I can’t out and I’m losing a lot of my friends ( not on bad terms but it hurts to reply to every “how are you?” With “bad”). 
And I love my family so much, they’re the most important persons to me, the closests. But I just learnt that it was only one way. I was close to them but they didn’t know me. 
You know what the worse is? I don’t remember all that bad behaviour, I zone out/dissociate a lot. Apparently I yell; I don’t remember ever having an argument with my little brother but he just told me it happened several times last summer. I was very mean with all of them, yelled at them and said horrible things ( again I don’t remember).  So they cut me off for several months, September to Christmas. Then I did something wrong for my sister’s birthday apparently and was cut off again in February. My mother only invited me to live with her because she had to pay my rent ( moved in with her end of April). They stopped telling me when they cut me off because apparently I don’t change. 
So my question to you all; I want to explain to them that it’s the depression and ask them to give me another chance ( I’m getting myself into a psychiatric hospital by the end of the week). But a big part of me don’t want to hurt them, to guilt them into forgiveness. I realised how much pain and hurt I caused, and it would be so much better for them if I got out of their life. 
It’s so hard to keep on living every day when you are in non stop pain ( it will be for life, there is no cure, but it won’t kill me so not a Medical research’s priority). I am useless, I can’t provide anything to society, I can’t work, I can’t have kids, I will be someone’s burden all my life. I am suicidal, but the only thing that kept me going was them. I couldn’t do it because it would hurt them. But I already hurt them alive, how much worse can dying really be ? Im seriously thinking of going to Switzerland for the assisted suicide charities, I don’t want one of them to find me dead and traumatise/hurt them even dead.

Does anyone have a way to kts that would actually work ?,"I can’t deal with this life anymore even though I’m a teen. I feel like I’m not important to anyone.

I'm not going to do it today.,"I'm honestly just here to vent.

Recently I got into a very minor traffic accident,  literally just a fender bender, but it was so triggering for me that I attempted (and failed miserably due to using an ineffective method) . Not just the accident itself was triggering, but the girl I hit called her uncle, (who was a fucking former prosecuter) over it and she decided to make me go to court because of him!!!! :D nobody in my family went to college or knows the law. How is that fair??  so anyway I went to court, and then I had to take a driving class where for some reason the police Sergent is allowed to show a bunch of 16-24 year olds real gore of real people dying in wrecks!!! :D I was the only person there who wasn't there for going 20 over the fucking speed limit!!! :D

I also am so fucking stupid and braindead that I managed to forget to appear in court last Thursday to simply acknowledge that i listened to an old geezer complain about how hard it is to be a cop and scrape peoples bodies off of hot pavement. I'm gonna call the court clerk in about three hours and see if I can fix it today. I won't get any sleep tonight. I would've if I could've forgotten for just a little while longer.

 After that, I have to drive almost an hour away to visit some office for a new job which will pay me barely enough money to live, take money out of my check to pay for licensing or something and health insurance. I remember when I first heard someone say that 15/hr was the bare minimum of what you need to live off of and thinking 15 was a lot. It's low. It's nothing, actually.

 I'm gonna go to college in the fall, on top of a full time overnight job, so that I can get some useless degree, because no matter which major I choose I feel like every market is flooded and I'll just end up making people's coffee.

 Especially considering that all I want to be in life is an artist. All I care about is creating art. But unfortunately, I feel like there are so many talented people that mine would be lost in the noise. I'm good at it but so is everyone else, including fucking AI apparently. I told someone that I was gonna major in graphic design and they deadass laughed in my face and told me to do something else because of ai. By the way, I think that people who can't tell the difference between ai and genuine art at least 80 percent of the time should not be allowed to vote.

And the worst part is I don't want either type of work, coffee or cushy. And I don't understand why that is so controversial to say. Why do you people dream of sucking off your bosses? I just want to swim in the lake by the dock with my best friends. I want to get a house for all of us to live in. I want to have fun and be young like I've never had the chance to before.

But I won't be able to afford that, because apparently the generations before mine were too retarded to create a sustainable and functioning economic system. The same people who care more about trumps stupid ear than 35,000 dead Palestinian people. The same people who literally unironically think Donald Trump was sent by God to ""save america"". From what?? Civil rights? And don't even get me started on how hot it's getting outside. Or how they keep finding microplastics in placentas.

I'm just so fucking angry because I just got here and everything is too fucking expensive. Old people complain about prices, but you at least had some time before during non recession periods to save something up. I have nothing. Once my grandma dies I will have nowhere to live, and I will have to scrap and struggle for every dime. And I never even got to be a teenager because of a fucking plague. I had no fun. I haven't even had my first kiss yet. The world is burning, and the only way I know how to solve my problems is by dragging a blade across my skin. I can't save anyone.",Small_Reveal3806,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4l2fp/im_not_going_to_do_it_today/

Worst arguement of my life,"Not even sure this is the right subreddit to post in. This morning was the worst point of my life. I got into a massive arguement with my big bro which I didn't even start. I broke glass, I started yelling at him for starting it. The reason is because I dont go outside and I haven't been to school in1 year due to kids bullying my looks and i've since developed depression and anxiety. People at my school used to call me horrible names and it's been sticking with me ever since. Every person looks at me in disgust like I murdered someone or something. I just wish someone was there to talk with and reassure me but nobody is willing to actually have a normal conversation with me. Kids at my age are having fun and hanging out with friends while i'm just here on my bed all day. Whenever I try to make a friend at school they either ignore look at me in disgust.

I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

Good News! I've finally decided the date!,"19th of July, Friday is the day I will finally be free! I will finally don't have to live anymore!

I have booked a therapy session that day and I have to commute my way there. I will get tot he station and as the train approaches I'll throw myself beneath it and that will be the end of it. 

It will happen so quickly that by the time anyone can do anything about it, I'll be long gone.

This is it. Now I'll be no more and don't have to live any longer. I never had a choice to be born so I'll make sure I have one now. 

There is no turning back and no last minute back outs. No more of that. It only happens in movies and TV shows that the person has a last min moment of clarity or some shit and they stop and then they get help and become better. I regret that. I cuss myself everyday that I should've just jumped in front of the train but didn't because lIfE or some shit like that.

My other best friend watched a friend of his kill himself many years ago, and is best friends with my BF and other bestie. While he says he feels like he could control himself if anything were to happen, he can’t guarantee that his trauma will take over and that he’ll hurt himself if either of the other two do…

Everything I have tried to do I have failed. I haven’t committed suicide because I am on medication and I have a dog.,"I am tired of trying. I have no energy to do anything or even take care of myself.

I remember years ago thinking if can only go up from here but things have gotten worse.

I only stay alive because my medication helps me and I have a dog.

I am a disappointment to everyone and especially to myself.

I have so much potential but yet nothing I have tried has panned out and I feel cursed. I no longer want to try or put effort into anything. It all goes downhill and never works out for me.

Others my age have families and children and friends and a career but my career prospects have just been ripped away from me and I don’t know what to do and I feel disillusioned.

I am not good at anything because mental illness has stolen a decade of my life and robbed me of my hobbies and interests. I am shell of who I used to be and I am numb to everything.

I want to kill myself or go to a mental facility but I don’t know what will happen to my dog if I go away for several days and if I commit suicide my dog will be sad.

I just don’t know how I can be this much of a failure even though I have tried. Maybe I didn’t try hard enough maybe I should have been better with my money and my mental health and shouldn’t have let the bad things that happened to me lead me down this path. I don’t know.

All the things people have told me to do to become happier hasn’t worked and I just give up now and fantasize about killing myself but I don’t want to go to hell and I worry about my parents not recovering and blaming themselves and also my dog will be sad.

I wish I could just cease to exist and feel nothing but not harm anyone just exist in a comatose state that I can’t wake up from. 

I wish everyone would leave me alone so I wouldn’t disappoint them any further. 

I have a great relationship with my boyfriend that I feel like I don’t deserve and I will screw up like everything else in my life because I don’t have any effort to be a better girlfriend. He deserves so much better than me and I am a disappointment. I just want to die more when I think about these things.

i feel like a burden,"i've been feeling off for a whole month already.  i've been having severe health anxiety, panic attacks, ocd, and depression.

yesterday, i had one of the worst panic attacks ever. it happened at 2:00 am-ish and i woke my mom up because it was so bad.

a few minutes into the panic attack she kept telling me stuff like ""get off your phone"" ""do something else"" ""i don't understand why this is happening to you.  you get everything you want"" bla bla bla.  i felt sad as hell but i slept it off

i woke up the next morning and the energy between me and my mom changed.  it felt distant and she looked, sad.  i asked her ""why do you look so sad?"" and she told me ""my husband's already a crazy man, and even you are crazy too.  i hate myself.  everything was a mistake."".  

i don't know what to do anymore.  it's not like i can control whatever my mind thinks, what my mind does to me, &amp; what my mind manifests in my body.  i just want to kill myself so she wouldn't have to care for me anymore.  i love my mom, she's the best person i've ever known and maybe me committing suicide would be the best option for me and her.

I was diagnosed with BPD this year. Should I kill myself?,"I've pretty much gone through everything at this point.

I've (unsuccessfully) gone through training via an outpatient program to learn DBT skills, I've restarted my ADHD meds (which help with my impulsive behavior, but not nearly enough), I've been seeing a therapist for about half a year now to no real effect, and I've continued to spiral, withdraw, self-harm, and drag everyone around me through completely insane emotional outbursts.

I don't feel self-righteous or justified in any way afterwards, though, the way people seem to talk about it. I feel exhausted and deeply embarrassed, because looking back, I can see how completely irrational I was being to the point that my own behavior doesn't seem to make sense at all. It just makes me want to crawl into a hole and disappear, because how the fuck could anyone tolerate that more than once? What makes a person like that worth the effort?

Everyone around me is trying their hardest, but my outbursts and meltdowns are constant, sometimes more than once a week, and none of the grounding techniques I learned in outpatient work very well.

I feel like a burden, persistently.

When I try to look up advice, information, or self-help, I'm just bombarded with horror stories about people's abusive relationships at the hand of someone with BPD, that people like me should simply be abandoned, how I'm doomed to suffer for the rest of my life, how I'll never be happy with anything and I simply cannot be fixed.

My therapist and my current psychiatrist tell me that what I have is actually CPTSD, and that BPD isn't a ""real"" diagnosis, and yet it's right there on my psych eval from my last psychiatrist, permanently affixed to my mental health record, and even they tell me that it's not something that'll ever be fixed, that I just have to learn to cope and manage it.

I'm sitting in a voice call right now feeling irritated by everyone speaking, wanting to lash out irrationally, but even if I leave it'll set people off, and that if I leave, I'm going to progressively cut myself off until someone comes to retrieve me. I can fucking hear it already, ""There she goes again, she's doing it again,"" I can hear the sighs and the exasperation, I can feel my best friend's blood pressure rising.

I just can't stand this anymore. I'm not happy. I'm never happy. I feel like a fucking curse on everyone in my life and I care too much about them to keep subjecting them to this bullshit. I can't even make new friends, I just drive them off or else they abandon me or lose interest, which is fair, given I'm not very interesting, so it's like there's just this slow trickle of everyone away from me, like I'm bleeding out, and I can't stand this persistent feeling of isolation and misery anymore.",RitualEnthusiast,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4cv50/i_was_diagnosed_with_bpd_this_year_should_i_kill/

Gender Dysphoria and Hopelessness,"I (18 AMAB) have been very depressed over my gender dysphoria for a long time, and have been diagnosed with clinical anxiety and depression for longer.

My family has no interest in helping or supporting me with wanting to be female. Any time I try to talk about it, I get shot down, told it's just a phase, or anything else except some empathy. I've been explicitely told I'm not allowed to ""Walk around here (home) thinking I'm a girl.""

Worse, my dad recently expressed that he thinks that project 2025 is a good thing and trump is a patriot. What's so worrying this that we don't even live on that continent. It just tells me that he's so conservative he's transcended nationality to support bigotry.

I hate looking in the mirror. Showering is agony. Even masturbating just feels bad, because I hate my genitals.

I have considered genital self mutilation, anything to get rid of it. But I'm afraid I'll be confronted by my family in a less than comfortable manner.

I’ve had enough. ,"People tell you to hang on in there and how it’ll get better, but I have spent almost all of my life waiting for it to get better and trying to change things and nothing has gotten any better. Believe me, I have tried so damn hard to change things and it very rarely if ever changes for the better. The rare time it does, it’s so short lived and never lasts. 

To be truthful I hate life. I don’t enjoy it. Every day is a god damn struggle, and I just want an off switch or to go to sleep and never wake up. I genuinely don’t have a reason to carry on, yet people will constantly guilt you by saying things like “what about your family” I have tried to talk to people numerous times and it only makes me feel worse.

I have no hope in life right now. I have struggled with depression since I was 9 years old and I recently got my Asperger's diagnosis but even though I am in therapy nothing is helping. I am currently 18 years old and I had to move out when I was 17 because I had to go to another part of the country for vocational training. Since then, everything has been even harder for me. But the worst thing is that I have no future. I finished secondary school (I think that's what it's called in English), but because of my grades, I had to work in really bad jobs. Because of my autism, I can't keep up and I don't know what to do. I am in debt and barely have enough money to eat. My family won't help me, so I just feel so alone and like suicide is the only option left to me, since I have to quit everything I try out.

help,"me (18) and my boyfriend (24) are falling apart. it started when we moved to my homestate and bunking up with my bestfriends. we moved from Texas to colorado hoping to be in a better ground because our old roommates had to go back to their homestate, and we were helping them and vice versa financially. my family dumped me last year about a month and a half after my b day, and my boyfriends sister and uncle are the only ones left for him. now it's mid July and we have been fighting. I know we both have trauma from shity lives, like foster care and family abuse. but I've been so close to blowing up on him to get over it like I did but that would be hypocritical and wrong. it's been every little thing and now he feels like he's begging for love, mostly I believe its because I am asexual, and rarely take him up on advances. I know I'm the cause of this cause I know that it's not right to project my mental problems onto him, and worse having an alter that hates being alive for me with a passion. honestly I don't know how to help him if I'm battling my self and my minds. any advice on how to make sure he feels loved and receives the proper emotional care?",anonymousAITA6088,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e46aqs/help/

I plan to end my life soon,"TW: mention of suicide plans. I’m not sure if this subreddit allows that but I checked the rules and couldn’t find any rules that said you can’t. 

I am going to kill myself very soon. I will steal rope from the shed at my place of work and tie a noose. Then I will go somewhere deep in the trees and find a high, steady branch. I’ll climb the tree and tie the rope off and push myself off the tree. Hopefully the fall breaks my neck, but I will wait to be strangled to death if it doesn’t.

Should I just kill myself? (Serious),"I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for many years. When I was in college for the last 6 years, it mostly stemmed from being lonely and being financially dependent on my parents. I hopped on dating apps and quickly realized how dating is simply not an option for me. I never bothered trying to date after that because I was an unemployed loser college student still dependent on mommy and daddy. Now I’m an unemployed loser college graduate that is still dependent on mommy and daddy. Fucking gross. I hate myself.

I thought things would get better. I finally graduated 7 months ago. My spirits were up. I finished with a CS degree, 4.0 GPA, and felt like I would find a decent job by now, even if it wasn’t in tech. I finally felt like I accomplished something. The reality is that I could only apply for a single job role with my degree, and I haven’t landed a single interview yet. It’s just constant and immediate rejections every damn time. People are now telling me a CS degree was a mistake and that I should have known better to major in something else. Obviously I’m a naive dumbass, especially for my age. Now I’m sitting here with a useless degree, only two irrelevant retail jobs as work experience, a 4-year employment gap…obviously I know to put projects on a resume for software development roles, but this doesn’t work for anything else. I have fuck all to put down. My only option lately has been to apply for jobs that don’t require a resume submission, and I’ve been doing that. However, if I’m really doomed to just throw away a degree I worked 6 years for and work at McDonald’s indefinitely for the rest of my life, then what else am I supposed to do? That’s not how I want to spend my life, and I don’t see what else I’m supposed to do anymore. I’m so fucking lost.

I feel like the only right option is to kill myself. Why shouldn’t I just do it? I clearly failed at life.",cybernetek,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e48z0r/should_i_just_kill_myself_serious/

How can I help my depressed friend?,"
Every day I feel more useless and helpless, I don't know what to do anymore :(
Some context: me and my best friend have been friends for about 5 years, she's had depression for as long as I can remember. We are both minors and we go to different schools, so we don't see each other very often and most of the time we only talk via chat. She has self-harmed several times before and, even if she thankfully hasn't attempted ending her life, she has thought about it. Ever since she started telling me about her depression and her problems, I did everything I could to help her. Unfortunately, because I didn't know how to react to that kind of situation, I think I ended up doing more harm than good. I would sometimes lash out at her, minimizing her feelings and overall saying very hurtful things that I didn't really mean. I know it was wrong and I feel terribly guilty about it. Apparently, because of this, she has become more reserved with me and no longer tells me her problems.

I'm trying to become a better person for her so I try to ask her if she's okay (when I can, since we don't talk much right now). She just told me that she was a little sad. I asked her if she wanted to talk about it and she said no, but hinted that she tried to hurt herself yesterday (she had done it before, I managed to stop her for a while but to no avail as she did it again). I honestly didn't know what to say. It stresses me out a lot that she doesn't tell me what's happening to her since I don't know how can I help her, but at the same time I know that I can't force her to tell me, especially after how I was to her. I really don't want her to hurt herself and I feel very sad to hear it, especially since she promised me she wouldn't do it again but she ended up doing it anyway. But I know I don't have to take it personally since this doesn't have anything to do with me. It just  distresses me so much to know that she's going through so much suffering, to the point of wanting to hurt herself, and I can't do anything at all.

So, in summary: how do I get her to open up to me again? How can I be a good friend to her? And, in the best case scenario, how can I make sure she doesn't have thoughts like that anymore and hopefully feels better?

I’m so depressed and all I want is to die. I wasn’t feeling well and my partner made me make an appointment with my therapist.

Then he asked if I took more than one and I said, Im doing well now. He continued by asking did you do intentional overdose on your medication and I responded, Im doing well now and I don’t like to talk about it. He said he wants to talk with my partner and I declined. Then he said that he has to call a police for well ness check and after some begging and discussion I relented and let him talk with my partner. He told my partner every thing and after that call, my partner collected all my pills and ruined my plan for my next overdose. The therapist told my partner that I will receive a call for iop program. I have not received the call yet but I will reject it once they call.

Poly relationships are wild.,"I've been fighting with my girlfriend a lot lately. She never wants to talk. Is stressed out by everything. I just want to support her, but I can't help her if she doesn't know what's wrong. She makes me feel bad for wanting to spend time with her or telling her I love her. We haven't had physical or emotional intimacy in about a month.

Truth be told I don't know what happened. We are in a poly relationship. She had another relationship end recently. Part of our rules were that we just don't talk about our jealousy issues. I suspect she's just not telling me anything because she's worried ill make it about myself. I know its too late for that. 

I told her today that I'd be there whenever she does want to talk. That it doesn't have to be today or tomorrow.

But every day fills me with more and more and more sadness and what feels like my relationship just falling apart. Its hard. We both need therapy. We both need communication and support. She at least has friends. I have nothing like that. If she stops talking to me about things I just don't even wants to think about it.

If i lose her... I would just want to end things instantly. I just wants this fucking sadness to go away. I want somebody to tell me its okay to tell my girlfriend I love her and that its okay to feel sad about the distance that has grown between us. I get that whatever happened wasn't because of me and that I'm making it about myself now.  I'm a selfish piece of shit who just wants my girlfriend to be happy and that would make me happy.

I'm a shitty boyfriend because I push her boundaries. Especially during sex. I'm a monster to her. And I don't know why. She's the best thing in my life. She's my shining star. And I hurt her. Again and again and again. She says that I don't respect or love her. That she's just someone to fuck to me. I hate myself. Why did I become this person.

Alone,"""Are you okay?"" 
Yeah I'm fine.
My brain screaming ""NO I'M NOT OKAY!!!""
I'm the only one that hears it. 
I haven't been okay in 20 years. I distract myself with people that I deem need me and push hard on that. I attach myself to people that are not okay thinking I will be the one that can help them find the place to be okay. A broken man trying to fix broken things hoping it fixes him.
I'm angry all the time and I push it down so nobody will feel it. I plaster a fake smile on and laugh and joke all the while dieing inside and no one sees. Silence is deafening and the only thing that truly scares me is being alone. I starve for attention while I tell people that I'm an introvert. 
I don't ask for help because I feel I can't more over I feel there will be none. I've have honed the craft of mimicking people in situations to fit in to blend and hide amongst the crowd. For acceptance. When I'm comfortable with a person the see the real me but it could take years for that. I don't trust easily and when I do I give my full heart to that person romantic or not. They have seen me and accept me. But every one leave in time. On thier own accord or death. I am left alone and it hurts and it scares me. I leave situations I can no longer deal with. Because it's easier than putting on a smile taking the assault and feel worse than I did before but if they feel better than that's all that matters. It's not them it's me. 
""You are so smart""
""You are so talented""
""You know so much about everything."" 
""You could be doing so much more.""
""You are so calm all the time""
""Nothing phases you.""
I learn things so I have the answer when someone needs it. I put that to practical use so I can help when someone needs it. If I thought I was good enough I might be able to focus long enough to do more. I have to stay calm or I will explode. 
I get stuck in routine because it is the only sense of normalcy I get in my life. It's the only thing that makes me be able to deal. When the routine is disrupted by outside forces (IE not me disrupting it) I don't deal very well. I develop new routines that become the new standard when it is disrupted in a major way. I'm straight forward and expect people to be the same but my mimicking skills gives me a way to be straight forward without upsetting the other person. Most of the time. My brain works differently I'm not ""Normal"" people expect something that I can never give them no matter how hard I try. I do try. People don't know how to talk to me. Or deal with me. They think they can for awhile but realize that they can't and I'm left alone again. At one point I tried to find the solace in the loneliness and I did for awhile. But it doesn't last never does. I attach myself to people and give my heart because I need that connection. And I so badly want to connect. Nothing is as beautiful in this world than looking into someone's eyes and seeing them and being seen by them. That connection can't break not for me. You showed me something that very few have seen. That is the true beauty in this life a connection with another person on the planet. Another person that has wants and desires and hopes and dreams. When someone leaves the beauty leaves with them. But connection is always there. Because when you find them again they feel it to. Even though I seem disconnected in a moment with a person I'm not. I'm there in the room but my mind is in a thousand places also. What you are saying is connecting with those things also and deeming the meaning of all of it. In the middle of a conversation I might say baby elephants are adorable even though we weren't talking about animals at all. My brain made 200 connection with what you said and baby elephants is where it landed. Now I can never think about baby elephants without thinking about that moment between us.",coldfireisdope,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2s27d/alone/

Is this a sign I might kill myself? 17F,"I usually don’t plan my suicide attempts. When I have attempted in the past it’s always for the most part been a spur of the moment thing. I am always depressed and suicidal but I push through until it gets to much. These past few months my depression has been worse than ever. I’ve recently attempted suicide. I feel like if I attempt again it’ll be over for me.

I’m an actor and I’ve recently been accepted to a really big project for my standards. The biggest I’ve ever done. And I have the most lines and everything. I’m was really excited but the past few days I’ve not been. And even though it’s 100% gonna happen I’ve been finding myself going “if I do the project” instead of “when”. A part of me feels like maybe I won’t. And today I got the script. Usually I’m so excited to read the whole script and I learn my lines straight away and usually have a lot of it learned in a few hours. I’ve only skim read through it and even though I want to read it all and learn my lines I don’t have any motivation to at all.

Even though this is the biggest role I’ve ever done and I’ve never experienced this before. I think maybe this is a sign my depression is getting worse. Maybe part of me knows I’m not going to make it till the show.

I feel trapped. ,"I have had thoughts of suicide for over 10 years now. My little brother killed himself little over a month ago, and the girl I was in love with killed herself 7 years ago. 
I understand the pain that suicide causes really well, and I don't want to hurt others. 
If I didn't care so much about others I would have killed myself a long time ago. 
So I just end up feeling trapped. Trying to distract myself just to get through the days, while also hating myself for wasting time.

"Why did you hurt me... And more importantly... Why do I miss you..

","I hate you.

That's a fact as simple as simple can be.

Like saying the sky is blue Like saying we breathe air  
It's fact, it's easy, it's obvious  
So **Why**  
Why do you live rent free in my thoughts?  
Why do I dream about you?  
Why do I have you in my thoughts always  
I look at something and your name is there

Those good times....  
Were they all a lie? Of course not...  
I adored you....  
You said you loved me...  
How did we end up like this?  
Where did I go wrong?  
What could I have done

It was like glass... We were fragile, beautiful... I broke it...  
You cut me  
You fucking tore open my heart  
You sliced deep, stinging  
Painful cuts  
Only you could have cut me the way you did...  
In the deepest, most painful way...  
those cuts, they heal....  
the scars... I reopen them...

I want to hug you...  
I want to tell you it's okay...  
When did we get so backwards...  
Scars...  
they are a reminder...  
What did you want me to remember...?  
Why did you cut me so...  
So deep...?  
Was it apathy?  
Did you *really* not care...

Am I a fool for loving...  
Letting my walls down...  
Allowing someone into my heart?  
Only to be  
...  
...  
...  
Mutilated...

You fucking mutilated me!  
I... I fucking trusted you, loved you, adored you, in the deepest way...  
You were so close to me...  
I let you in...  
...

So it *is* my fault huh?  
*i'm* the dumb fuck?  
The one who was so **stupid**, to be vulnerable....  
To let myself show through this...  
facade...  
To think *stupidly*, to be so naive, that I believe that someone actually loves me...  
I'm sorry...  
I still do love you....

I do...

Tired Without Escape,"Sorry for the stupid title, i lack originality and will to think about it.

I'm male, 21 years old and living in Italy. I've felt depressed in the last years, but i think that it's only in the last two that i've got clinical depression. Sadly i don't have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist, it's just that my sadness is worst and i see nearly every symptom in me. 
I've always thought about the possibility of suicide, but never in a totally serious way until these last months. Now i'm searching ways to do it, thinking what and if leave something to the few people i care etc.

To be honest i don't know why i'm writing this. I was searching ways to kill myself and found this subreddit, then thought ""Why not?"". Now i feel even more pathetic to be honest, i've read a lot of stories here, people in huge pain and with big problems while i'm depressed just because of problems with myself and my family. It feels like i don't deserve to complain about it and that i'm just stupid to be sad.

Two days ago i was hanging me, but choose not to because i cannot leave my girlfriend alone. She's also depressed (actually diagnosed) and doesn't deserve more suffering, i'm trying to live in orser to make her less sad, but i don't know how long i'll be able to.
She wants me to go to therapy, but i don't think my parents can afford it and probably would think that i'm stupid, crazy or not really depressed if i'd tell them this.

My dad's a deadbeat ,"NOTE: I have not been diagnosed with Depression. However I do suspect myself of having it and don't know where else to post this.

I (a 16M) am struggling a lot right now for a lot of reasons. I have no hobbies and don't take  an interest in anything. As an Autistic person that's unheard of, so to fit in with the Autistic community I faked a special interest in history for months. Speaking of Autism, because of  it I struggle with socialising and therefore hate every*one* alongside every*thing*. I have really bad self-esteem issues. I want to be an author yet can't spell the most basic of words, can't think of any ideas for books and have the world's worst handwriting. However I think my biggest issue is my deadbeat dad.

My dad an alcoholic and he chose alcohol over me. My dad didn't love me enough to choose me over some drinks at bar. Only now that I'm typing this do I realise how entitled I am, but it's how I feel nonetheless. I saw him on and off until 2022 and he was always mentally unstable. He would always yell at some small random thing I did, even when I was little. If I trust what I've heard (which I honestly don't since humans do nothing but manipulate) he also hit his children when he still lived with us, before he got kicked out, before he chose alcohol over me.

All this has made me feel so depressed. I would have committed suicide by now if I wasn't such a coward. Does anyone here know a quick, safe way of committing suicide? I'd greatly appreciate it if someone told me.",TommyCola65,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4515w/my_dads_a_deadbeat/

I can’t stop thinking about it,"I (23F-ish) can’t stop thinking about killing myself. I tend to end up imagining how or when I’ll kill myself, and I keep imagining what or if I say anything to bother people before I do it. I have a handful of friends who I feel as though I have trapped in a bugs bunny-esque social contraption to stay out of obligation and I know my family despises me and how I rarely leave my room. Often, I crutch these ideas as though I’m telling my “imaginary therapist” but lately that barrier has been withering away and it feels more solid. I refuse to tell people because of how they have reacted to less intense things I or other figures have said in the past.

I’ve been thinking that I’m evil, unloveable, and repulsive. I know what my body looks like and I get the whole “you’re just not your type” but at the end of the day I hate how I am regardless of the state because I’m the one inside it. I’ve never been desired and the idea that I could be is laughable and eldritch. I feel as though the only worth I have is through my job, but that the cost of me existing outweighs it, significantly. I feel evil for existing and not having died sooner.

For a while I thought I was fine, I was able to beat this shit back into the bay for a few years with it cropping up occasionally but I feel like I’ve fallen into “bad habits”. I want to lie down on the train tracks and get run over.

I hate this shit so much because I know that sometimes I feel better, less or even not suicidal. But the issue is that I really feel like a completely different person, and being that way I know logically that I have the same thoughts but they just don’t “feel” the same like I’m flipping between two side of a coin.

i’m in so much pain all the time. i’ve already had a traumatic life before all this, i’ve lost a lot of people in my life. in april of 2022, my mom died as a result of domestic violence. i was abused horribly as a child, raped at 17, and have been sexually assaulted many times. i suffer from BPD (along with other disorders) and it’s made my life hell.

Long time coming,"Writing this partly to leave some kind of record and edge myself forward. On a vpn so nobody bother try track me.

After 31 years I'm calling it quits. The last seventeen or so years have been, for the most part, utter misery. No idea how I survived this long but I refuse to any longer. There is quite simply nothing for me in this world. When I was at least somewhat materially comfortable I could keep myself distracted. I hesitate to say happy, but I wasn't constantly thinking about suicide.

Now I am homeless. Can't even get a spot in a hostel or any other kind of temporary housing. Charities and government-adjacent organisations do quite literally NOTHING apart from check that you've essentially registered as homeless (day one obvious stuff) and are aware of where to get a free meal every day. Presumably this is all they do all day and they are paid for it. Bizarre. Glorified directories.

I was on and off various SSRIs for years. Always been skeptical of them but in times of desperation I would go for it. Maybe some small benefit after a few months but hard to tell if it was that or other self improvement things I was trying. Either way, no meaningful difference. Therapy was a joke. Unfortunately, therapy and SSRIs are the only thing medical professionals recommend. ""I know you've tried A, B, C, D and E.... but you haven't tried F yet!"". Fuck you. Another flavour of pill is not going to change me, and my refusal to try is not proof I'm not serious about wanting to get better.

Despite having a long history of depression, whenever I've spoken to them recently they just latch onto the fact that I'm homeless. Obviously its not nice, but that's really not my issue. Worse still, it is very clear they think I'm just trying to score some free food from them and get somewhere to sleep indoors for the night. I've been to A&amp;E three times in five months. One time I was on the very edge of ending it, but they talked me down. The next time I visited I overheard them talking and they flat out stated they thought I was grifting so I left and decided to never speak to them again.

Last roll of the dice was to see my doctor because generally they're more qualified than the social workers role playing as mental health professionals. In addition to SSRIs and therapy she also recommended Jesus. In fairness, my medical history may have had my past beliefs on there which made her comfortable bringing it up - but what the fuck. Won't be going there again. 

Family are trash and not worth talking about. Haven't seen them in years and wouldn't want to. No friends either and I always have to ask myself why. I had them in school which is relatively easy when you're forced to see each other nearly every day. Genuinely enjoyed their company and would sometimes have periods where I would see them outside but it always burned me out after a while and I would pull back. We drifted apart but no hard feelings on my end. I was also involved in a bit of a scandal which definitely was my doing so that finalised things. Met nice people at various jobs but always kept things confined to the office and the occasional work party. Had a few girlfriends but never made it past early stages. The desire to keep it going was never there and I was happier alone. I'd have periods in my life where I told myself ""relationships aren't supposed to be easy, I need to sacrifice more"" and I would always end up hurting myself. Maybe I'm high functioning autistic or have some kind of personality disorder, who knows. Numerous professionals have asked if I'm ""sure"" I haven't been diagnosed with anything but they never press further.

Social issues aside, I have other flaws. I've always been lazy at work. I have known for long time that lack of sleep is a significant driver of my depression but efforts to correct this never lasted longer than a few weeks. I've drank alcohol excessively at points and gotten into some terrible states, though I have ""quit"" for months at a time when I felt like it. FWIW I've not had a drop in months, can't enjoy it living like this. I messed around with a married woman for a brief period despite her having kids and knowing she probably only latched onto me because of family issues she was having. Saying mean shit online. I have been cold to people and sometimes relished in knowing they were feeling hurt. Me simply getting involved in anyone's life knowing I will eventually make a mess.....its not right. This isn't just bad social skills, something else is wrong and I can't make it work despite a general desire to do the right thing and strong aversion to anything outright evil. The willpower isn't there to change myself in any meaningful way.

I've rambled. The burst of emotion which prompted this has faded but the final mission is still scheduled.

Fuck you to:
Teachers at school who witnessed me having a personality transplant overnight and never thought to ask what was wrong.
99% of homeless charities - and homeless people quite frankly.
The NHS. It's dogshit and needs to be pulled by the roots (not just based on my experience)

Thank you to:
My past girlfriends. Love will always be there, sorry I couldn't make it work.
My last two friends. It was only a year but it was special. And I promise I didn't fancy you-know-who. Objectively gorgeous but purely platonic on my end. 
People at work who tolerated me more than was reasonable. 
Everyone from church. Sorry for sudden departure.
The two charities that offered real help.

When I go, it won't be messy. Just a long sleep. Let's see what's next.

"I don’t want anything from life, just keep breathing?","I know, every single post in this thread looks like this, but I don’t know if every single person means it.

There’s nothing I want from life. There’s nothing I am good at or even want to do. Every now and again I will pick up something that I don’t really know too much about and tell myself “Here, I want to do this, this makes me happy”, but the reality is, when I get to know anything, I don’t feel like doing it. Nothing does. And I fail in it, fail in everything so bad that no one will even remember me.

Even if I may say that ok, let me not try and do something mega. Just keep doing tasks assigned to me, I can’t. I have no energy or interest in doing any of those little tasks too.

This includes work, yes, but it also includes friendships, family  and romance or even something like self-care. I might get really into something for a day or two, and then I don’t feel like doing it at all.

I’m old, 35, and have no friends who I’ve been with for more than a year. Have no motivations to keep doing things and facing rejection (external and internal).

I don’t know if withering away is an option, but I’m sure I will fail in that too.

i have no will to try anymore. ,"i'm going to be 32 in february which in itself is a huge achievement; when i was a teenager i never thought i'd live past it-and i might have been right. i've taken most of the people in my life for granted because i was so swept up in trying to cultivate this image that i was doing better than i actually was, and a person that people would like rather than be the person i am. i tried to forgive and forget the child torture i was forced to endure living with my mother who isolated me from everyone and everything, had her friends monitoring the house while i was stuck there alone five days out of the week, until eventually i was old enough to ""take care of myself"" which seemed to make her think that was permission for her to only show up at the house two to five days out of the month. i was never taught discipline. i was never exposed to social environments so i've always struggled with etiquette. i was never shown how to believe in myself, or accept love, or that i was capable of success. i've always been treated like i'm just wrong, body soul and mind. i ruin everything. im a plague. i dont deserve anything good because i'm always wrong and i always fuck everything up. i've never been able to break through the abuse, and i've never had a single therapist who was proficient enough in their art to actually give me the help i need, because i cant afford good insurance that would pay for a more efficient practitioner. and i wont even try. i to my core, don't believe i deserve the help, or to live happily. i can't break the cycle. i was sexually trafficked as a toddler with several other children and recorded as i was assaulted. i've told nobody that mattered this.

my mother and i got into a heated argument a year ago where i held her accountable for some of the things she did, and we didn't speak for five months after. imagine how shocked i was when she texted me threatening to call the cops if i didn't return the guns and silver i ""stole"" after breaking into her apartment (understand i don't drive bc of disabilities and she lives very far away; i take two trains and a bus to get to her place - not to mention i'm agoraphobic ?? it takes a two day pep talk just to convince me it's safe to go to the store across the street from my apartment), and then when i refuted the accusation she said "" yea you probably already sold it all already so nvm "" and then proceeded to tell the family that she SUSPECTS i did these things. if i was to break into her apartment to take anything, it would've been to take the fucking dog. now the family won't tell me where my dementia addled grandmother has been moved to bc they think i'm some kind of drug addicted arms dealer. there's no words for the shock and grief that's subdued me. she's always been a horrible mother and person, and yet i'm in agony over this. i've been grieving the loss of something i never even had for over a year, and all my will is just...gone. i can't hold down a job and i don't care. i'm gaining a lot of weight, and i don't care. i'm isolating and can't get out of bed anymore, and i just don't fucking care at all. all the work i put in when i was in my twenties to give myself some sort of reprieve (ie medications to keep me straight, a modicum of work ethic to keep a roof over my head, maintaining a healthy diet and routine) i've demolished in a state of apathy and self sabotage. there's no joy in being alive when i can't pick myself up. i need help with everything, and i have no one. i don't even want to try. i'm inclined to ask my roommate to remove her shotgun from the home, but i've seen that outcome, and i don't want that to be the last thing she sees of me, and i don't want to leave the dogs scared and confused, and traumatized.

i can't afford to flee the country, and i desperately need to because it's trying to kill me. i have no support systems. i can't stop grieving. i'm crying every day. i don't want to do it anymore. there's no future. it's not worth it. i don't want to get up anymore. there's nothing to get up for. i'm angry and mean all the time. i've never been a good person and i cannot change no matter how hard i try. i wish i was dead.",krichur,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2t7r8/i_have_no_will_to_try_anymore/

Feel like I was destined to always have a low self esteem,"I can’t think of any other instance where I felt good about myself besides this very brief two year period in high school. I didn’t always hate myself, but I surely didn’t love myself either. I don’t believe in self worth, worth is something that I feel has to be assigned to me. I’m not sure if the issue is not getting enough compliments or praise as a child by my parents, or just that I’ve always been a bit of a cynical person. If my parents tell me that I’m handsome or smart, of course they’d say that. They’re my parents. It doesn’t mean anything to me when it’s coming from family. Although I probably shouldn’t say that because in the brief period that I did actually have a bit of self confidence, that’s when coincidentally I’ve heard my mother say that I looked handsome for the first time. I lost a lot of weight in high school and the girls took notice. Since elementary school, I’ve always dreamt about what it would be like to be desirable. No one ever showed interest until I lost the weight. This new found confidence didn’t last too long because I had already sunk down to a very deep place emotionally the previous year and I always dealing with a large number of insecurities. I eventually ended gaining the weight back and stopped putting effort into my appearance. None of it felt like it mattered because my self esteem had already been destroyed due to the bullying I received the previous year. It’s been eight years since I’ve graduated from high school and I still haven’t recovered from the bullying I experienced. I still don’t have any love for myself and I’m at the point where I’m more likely to come up with every possible reason why someone is being disingenuous with me when they’re giving me a compliment (not that I receive many anyways), than for me to actually believe them. I’ve waited for most of my life for people to give me the OK for me to feel great about myself, and now I won’t believe anyone who tries to compliment me. I myself don’t even know what it’ll take to build up my self esteem. Apparently I’m too averse against the concept of loving myself.

I got too much love as a child. It’s ruined me.,"I’ve come to the conclusion lately that I do not want to live and function as an adult. I shouldn’t have to have any commitments or responsibilities. I should have died age 7. My life has been downhill since then. 

My parents loved - and still love - me so hard, it makes me hurt inside. I don’t know if that makes sense? I refuse to look for romantic love because the only people I want to care about are them. The more years I spend masking my true self (because nobody - nobody - would ever suspect I’m like this; me, the attractive, successful career woman who has bought her own apartment and been living independently for over ten years), the more I want to give it all up and just move back in with them and totally regress. I want to regress to the age I was when I didn’t know of negative emotions, or anxiety, of grief and loss. I want to be ignorant. I am both saddened and filled with rage that growing up happened. I want it to be just the three of us forever. To play with Barbies with my dad in the garden. I want to see colours as brightly as I used to. I want my mum to hold me tight. The love I experienced in my childhood is like a chokehold. On a bad day, old memories is all I can think about. I cycle through them in my brain and cry until I have no voice left.

Nobody asked me if I wanted to be an adult. Nobody checked with me. I watch my friends get married and have kids and I’m like why. Why do you want to adult so badly? How sad that you are now taking care of your own children. You should still be children yourselves. Why the fuck are we getting older?

And then, because everyone seems to be going down that path, I start thinking ‘What gene am I missing that I turned out so wrong?’

I would like to die a dignified death with my parents in a couple of decades’ time. I can hold on till then if I know I get to go with them. I fully intend to end my life as soon as they go, but I am hoping that they might be interested in looking into options of going the three of us at the same time.

I thought I was stable. I wasn't. ,"I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

i really need help.,"i don’t know what’s wrong with me, for some reason i’m incapable of communicating my feelings with anyone. i had a slight falling out with one of my best friends today because i was really struggling but it just turned into anger and i completely took it out on her when i shouldn’t have, so she just told me to fuck off and ended the call, we’ve never really fallen out before so i just feel like a really crappy friend. 

also, my other friend also got mad at me the other day because i wouldn’t tell her how i was doing (although she is VERY pushy when it comes to this sort of thing and the last time i told her it ended up with me being safeguarded). 

i’ve been in a constant loop since i was 10. i feel numb for a while and then go into a really deep state of utter sadness (which lasts around 2-3 months, the numbness can last anywhere between 1-2 months). 

i believe that i have had depression for a really long time, i’m currently on the waiting list to be diagnosed for ADHD and i’ve made it clear to my therapist that i wanted a diagnosis for depression but she just pretty much ignored me.

i’m my own enemy, i bottle things up so much and i don’t know why i just can’t open my mouth and talk to anyone. in fact, the bottling up led to two attempts in february because i felt so alone, i also started sh again after 2 months sober.

is my trauma valid?,"
Hello, im a 17 years old girl with lots of trauma. For context my mom (40f) and my dad (38m) have their own traumas which are connected with their own parents. half of my family has mental issues and alcoholism. anyway, lets go to my story, when i was 7, i went to 1st grade of elementary school (im from Europe, i will not say what country). My dad picked his 10 hour long work, yes he’s working 10h per day. Im seeing him maybe 10 min per day for 10 years now. My dad is abusive emotionally towards me and sometimes my mom. For example, on my 14 bday he told me that he hates me and he never loved me cuz i didn’t went to school that day. And he’s always yelling at me that he spends money on my therapist, psychiatrist and meds. he hates the fact that i have LOTS of mental illnesses. Also i was bullied my WHOLE life in school, thats why i have my school online now. Plus, im not basic AT ALL from my appearance, and he’s always laughing at me how ugly i am. When i was a kid and i wanted his help he was yelling at me and telling me how stupid i am. Thats why when i was 11 years old i started sh and i was suicidal, and nothing changed to this day. On the other hand, my mom is drinking so much and she has alcohol issues. And she’s always yelling at me that its not true that she has issues with alcohol. Plus, shes never protecting me from my dad. For example, yesterday i came home crying cuz people were laughing at me on the street cuz of my looks and overall im extremely suicidal since 1 month. (i had suicide attempt 2 years ago and i want to repeat it) And my mom was complaining at me that im weak. Plus she told me that she have REAL trauma and problems and she’ll die cuz of me. Plus she’s always yelling at me that she’ll close me in mental asylum. honestly? i have nobody. my grandma which i was extremely close with died 4 years ago, she was only 52 years old. i have enough. i want to kms. and i feel like my parents are right. Is my trauma valid or i am overreacting? (obviously they’re examples cuz worse things happened with my parents)

Turns out I might have cancer,"I swear I'm cursed or something. Bad shit keeps happening to me, it's not been a very good few months already and now I've got to deal with this too. 

I've had symptoms of bowel cancer for a while now, but I just assumed it was something else since I'm young so I ignored it. Last week the symptoms got so unbelievably bad that I had to see my doctor. I was hoping for something simple but he ruled out hemorrhoids or a fissure an had me do a FIT test. I maxed out that test, literally as high as it could measure. There's only a couple diseases that can cause that result, and the only one that matches my symptoms is cancer. I'll have an endoscopy soon to confirm though.

Ive almost certainly got cancer, at 23 years old. Ill probably lose all my hair from chemo and look like a man. They might have to cut out parts of my bowels. I might need a permanent colostomy bag. Maybe it's spread to other parts of my body and I'm basically dead already.

I’m probably going to kill myself tonight,"I don’t know if this needs a nsfw marking so if it does I can or however that works.

But im pretty sure im going to do it tonight. I’ve had a rough life if that’s how I should put it, a lot of bad things have happened to me. And for a while I thought I was getting better, but it turns out that was fake. It doesn’t really improve for me. Up and down, back and forth of happy and sad. I’ve dealt with depression for some time now. And the past few weeks I’ve sort of been driving myself crazy. I’ve also not had a good relationship with the people around me. Me and my mom have been arguing or fighting a lot despite my efforts to avoid it, trying to be better, etc. my siblings hate me. They tell me that everyday and they’ve just resorted to insulting me and telling me to kill myself. I don’t have any friends nor do I have anyone im romantically involved with. I’m alone 99% of the time. I have nobody, I am nobody. I am a living embodiment of nothingness, of failure. 

I try to be a good person. I do good things, I help people whenever I can. I have a job and I’ve been in school. I have always made a point of being there for others in any way possible. But nobody gives me the same. People either use me for money or try to use me for sexual things. That’s all I am to anyone. Someone they can use, who they know won’t argue. I’m a pushover, a failure, a disappointment, and so much worse. 

And I was having a bad day again, and my mother and I had to argue. Like the universe had an itch it needed to scratch. And now im sitting here crying planning everything out. I have no notes to write. Maybe one to my mother apologizing for doing her the disservice of being her child, of ruining her life just by being in it. And just a general note of what I’d like done with my things and my pets. I hope they get taken care of nicely when I’m gone and I hope my things don’t just get thrown away, but if they should, I understand that decision as well. 

I know I can’t talk about methods or anything so I won’t. I don’t plan on doing it in a messy way, I’ve cleaned everything so I don’t have to burden anyone with the cleanup afterwards. 

I just hope if anyone on here sees this that someone would remember me. Whether in a positive or negative light, I just want to know someone knows I existed. That I was here. And I tried. I just want to be remembered as a good person that tried. ",StateFormer6241,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3hr1r/im_probably_going_to_kill_myself_tonight/
my depressed online bsf is making me depressed ,"i met my now bsf about two months ago on the internet. he's a great friend &amp; has helped me in many ways. i genuinely enjoy talking to him. the thing is, he broke up with his ex about 6 months ago &amp; he's been crazy depressed &amp; suicidal since then. a little after we met, he started falling for me. so did i. he started showing signs of getting better. but it worsened when i told him i was atheist &amp; since he's a theist, there was no way we could ever end up together. then he was back to being depressed. 

everyday we talk about anything &amp; everything. all the time. from the moment i wake up to the moment i go to bed. some days he's really really depressed &amp; fsr i feel like i'm obliged to do anything &amp; everything in my power to make him happy. even if it doesn't work, i still do everything. i don't like leaving him to himself bc ik he'll start overthinking &amp; be sad again. 

he's my best friend &amp; it hurts so bad to see him this way. he doesn't deserve this &amp; i always feel like it's my responsibility to make sure he's not sad. he has an emo posting account on ig where he sometimes make posts saying he misses ""them"" &amp; it hurts so bad especially bc he's clearly in love with me. it makes me feel like he's using me to get over her. sometimes i wish for her to just come back to him, apologize &amp; take him back. i did kind of confront him about this but he assured me that he would never use me like that &amp; that he just misses being happy. but idk man. i try to ignore the posts on that account of his but they pop up on my feed &amp; with every post i feel a knife twist &amp; turn inside me. everytime i see that he's posted something sad on that account, i get so so anxious to check it out. sometimes i get close to tears seeing the shit he posts there. whenever he mentions his ex, i get so fucking anxious, i have to put my phone away for a while &amp; then come back.

i do everything i can to make him feel better but nothing works. he's so precious to me &amp; i just want him to be happy. i'm really boring &amp; unfunny but he still talks to me about anything.

he sometimes send me pictures of his online girl bsf whom he loves like a sister &amp; says stuff like ""she's so pretty i love her"" &amp; it's true. she really is pretty. she's gorgeous. everytime he sends me her picture, i can't help but zoom in &amp; admire her. she makes me feel so ugly &amp; insecure. everytime he sends me her picture i get so anxious bc ik he'll say something like he loves her or that she's so pretty &amp; idk why. sometimes i wonder if he does the same to my pictures with her but i doubt it. a few weeks ago i was crying bc i felt like i would never be pretty enough for him. i went to our chats &amp; pulled up pictures of her &amp; started crying even harder. i felt so insecure.

the thing is. i rarely ever cry. but these past two months i have cried about 3-4 times. i just got done crying for 40 minutes. i was even clean from self harm for almost two years &amp; i relapsed like last month. i've self harmed twice till then. i even had the urge to do it rn but i didn't. 

i just want him to be happy. even if it's without me. sometimes i feel like he doesn't love me &amp; it hurts. i'm very cautious while talking to him bc i don't want to say anything that'll remind him of his ex or make him sad. i don't tell him when i'm sad bc i don't want to add onto his depression. but he tells me everything. he shares a lot with me &amp; trusts me so much. we'll meet irl next year bc we'll go to the same university. who knows what'll happen till then. it's been like a week since our chats have been dry, bc he's sad &amp; i have no clue how to make him feel better. i have nothing to talk about. even if i do, his replies are short &amp; he seems uninterested. ik that's not the case &amp; he's just too sad to talk. &amp; that hurts. knowing i can do nothing to help. i've kind of accepted that i can't help him &amp; it hurts. i don't know what to do. i just want him happy. i feel so emotionally drained. he doesn't know any of this.

Depressed ex just left and I wanna text her,"It happened yesterday morning. We have been together 3-4 months and everything’s been amazing, it’s not often I find a connection with someone. 
The past week or she has been struggling with depression, she has been noticeably struggling with needing space and I given it to her whenever she asks and however much she needs. It always ends with her wanting to be near me and holding her.
A couple days ago she had a tough day and really opened up to me and I listened and told her I was there there for. She kept saying how amazing and grateful she was to have me as a boyfriend.
Yesterday morning she woke up and we talked on the phone about meeting up because we had plans and she wanted to see me, her words, but after a few minutes when we’re gettting ready and her kitten just pooped on her carpet she started spiraling about she didn’t wanna drive and that I deserved better and that she’s bringing me down and destroying my life. Eventually we broke up but I made sure she knew I disagreed. 
We agreed to meet up next weekend to exchange stuff. 

Now a day later, I can’t stop thinking about how she spiraled and maybe I should’ve told her to take a second cool down and that she didn’t have to drive I’ll come see her.

I feel lost. I'm the biggest burden to myself.,"I have never felt like I belong?

I'm sure most people feel that way.

Each day feels like I'm putting on a mask. 

I overthink too much, I drink too much, I sleep too much, I worry too much, I smoke too much, I talk too much, I'm too needy, I need too much attention, I **AM** too much. Thats what anyone I talked to ever told me.

I feel genuinely happy that I'll move in with my boyfriend soon, and we're picking up our little kitten on saturday. I'll go to school again after having finished training. I have a roof over my head. I have food.

But am I happy? Am I genuinely happy? Or is that just what I **NEED** to feel? 

I feel pathetic for every feeling that I have. Im stressed about exams? Why? I'm ""smart"" according to former colleagues and my partner... I dont deserve to feel stressed or anxious.

I have healthy coping mechanisms? But why need them? Other people might think they're weird. Other people have it worse. Others cope better.

My life is going good.

Why do I still have the urge to selfharm or more?  
Why am I mentally exhausted every night? Why cant my damn mind stop running?

Why does everyone seem to find friends easily? I have noone.  
I cant talk to people. Neither irl nor online. 

But I cant go, my dog and future cat would be sad.  
Eventhough I hate myself even more, since I'm moving out soon and wont see my dog as often..

Emotional abuse ,"Get yelled at most days:
For not reading his mind
For saying something in the wrong tone.
For crying after he is harsh and unkind.

I'm so tired of depending on him for anything that will later inevitably get used against me.

Is there that one moment that completely bent your life out of shape?,"I(24m) was lost and broken and just lost the person closest to me. I went to visit my professor (45f) after graduation. I haven't seen her in 5 years.
I was writing her a novel.

She was the only person in the world that could snap me out of depression. At this point not even love could. She knew I was living with my lone grandmother. One day she had a stroke and I had to leave town. I was so sad I may never get to see my prof again. But I held on the hope that she would get better. There was that voice at the back of my head telling me that something bad had happened to the prof. 

It turned out true her mother died and she was all alone. I promised to always visit. 

I got severe depression because i couldn't handle seeing the my hero this broken. I decided to be her hero and make her happy.

I visited several time with gifts, agreed I would help her with researches. I visited once and then she told me to come again the following day even calling me son.

I went and a friend of hers (that doesnt know me) humiliated me for being unemployed and made fun of everything even saying that she would report me for harassment if I ever came again. All this while my prof played dumb or joked at my expense.

She knew how much she meant to me and still did that. I started flipping out knowing that she will have to cut me off to preserve her image being a single woman and all.

And it was true she now wouldn't even talk to me in the street or would very aggressive leaving while I am talking.


This has made me spiral into a lot of sexual or that I am into older women and violent thoughts, therapy didn't help and nothing is getting better it has been a year.

My brain is forcing me to either fix it somehow or end myself. And I know she isn't worth it either.

I'm autistic and have tinnitus. I feel suicidal. ,"I developed tinnitus a couple of weeks ago and it is already driving me insane. I hear a constant loud, high-pitched ringing in my ears (worse in my left ear). I have sensory issues and used to wear noise cancelling headphones to deal with overstimulation; silence was integral to being emotionally regulated and preventing meltdowns. Now, I can never have silence, and I have to have constant sound to try to drown out the tinnitus but it's so loud that it's hard to block it. I'm like an exposed nerve 24/7. I'm not sleeping more than a couple hours a night if I'm lucky. I'm dysregulating constantly. I'm struggling to look after myself or to work. I'm scared I'll lose my job or have to quit because I can't function. 

I don't have family, so I need to be able to look after myself in every way. But I'm struggling so bad. 

It's like the final nail in the coffin on top of everything else. I also have EDS and live with daily pain and frequent injuries. I have anxiety and depression. I'm a survivor of childhood abuse and neglect. I'm very isolated and only have my partner and one real friend. Being autistic already made life quite difficult. 

On top of it all, I'm actually Catholic and suicide is a sin to us, so I'm torn between the impulse to end my life just to get away from the tinnitus and the fear of going to Hell. And of course, there is the catholic guilt from contemplating suicide. ",knife-frog,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4zobb/im_autistic_and_have_tinnitus_i_feel_suicidal/

my father also never finished school (all of his siblings finished) but then he tells me ""IT'S THE DESTINY THAT DID THIS DADADADA, AIN'T MY FAULT"" then proceeds to blame my freaking existence to god telling me it's god that wanted us to be born not him like man unless our mother is god damn virgin mary right there our mom don't just get pregnant without you having sex with her or wanting to have kids with her, oh yeah my eyes are also extremely bad i couldn't even read a letter properly from 5 feet away, they won't buy me glasses because they think i just want to look like a smart ass and they don't believe my hearing problems while thinking u jjust don't want to comply with what they tell me then they think I'm abnormal while they themselves overthink and over react so much, my step mother also on his side because who am i to her, just a guy who she feels obligated to take care of, he would often look for things about me that's ""not good enough"" just so he could get mad and strat yapping his whole ass out of his mouth.

he also thinks I'm gay just because I don't go outside (that's not a joke he seriously had a conversation with me about that but even after explaining myself and how going outside doesn't make you straight he concludes that i am indeed gay, spoiler alert, i am not), then he starts trying to argue out of nowhere blaming me for his own faults like ""only if you were there but you weren't so it's your fault even though you're taking a dump when it happened it's your fault"" and whatever my brother does that's wrong I'm still included when i have got nothing to do with that situation but when it's only me it's just me.

TL;DR - Father doesn't believe me, accuses me shit and makes me confess to it, my brother's wrong I'm involved, my fault only me, finds things about me to get mad about, thinks everything his mind tells him is true, paranoid as hell, and i got nowhere to run,

Making a photo album before leaving soon ,"
 

I'd really like to be able to prolong this to see how far I can go and if I can heal from all this so that I can build a better life together with the one I love.

I spent 9 years away from my cousins and when I saw them again a few days ago, I saw how much they had evolved with their lives and I was completely saddened, distressed and without expectations, one of my cousins is already getting married and building her family, the other is already working with what she likes and will probably find someone who loves her too.

As for me, how can I put it? Things aren't going so well, you know? Haha... I've been waiting for something good to happen to me for seven years, but I'm not getting my hopes up.

I feel like I'm being pushed to the edge of an abyss. Depression has destroyed everything I had left, the only good memories have become remnants, a figure in the fog of my memories,  

So I decided to make an album and take some photos to remind me of some landscapes and moments that were somewhat comforting for a while, even if they only mean something to me, I would like to revisit these photos in the near future before I leave, at least to remember my old self

When everything seems dull and uninteresting,"This was originally posted on photography subreddit.

Some comments suggesting that this might be deeper than it actually is, so I want to learn from those who are surviving and have learned about it.

Basically, these are the sentences on the post

&gt;Sorry for the long post, this sounds like a rant.

&gt;I've been struggling with not being able to notice and see beauty in the things.

&gt;I think that everything looks dull and ugly to the point where it becomes toxic and unhealthy, and the rabbit hole goes deep it even affects my psychology. I try to justify this by thinking that I just live in uninteresting place which is an absolute ignorant and arrogant opinion. I'm totally wrong feeling this away, I know that for a fact.

I'm aware of my seemingly lack of appreciation towards things especially the ones closely to me. Sadly it's affected my hobby which is photography and my point was to maybe see whether there's some photographers who've had those kinds of experiences, because I'm genuinely looking for help.

Is that kind of thing a sign of depression or anything related to mental health problems?

Switching from Zoloft to Lexapro to Wellbutrin,"Hello, I (21F) had my first experience with antidepressants in the form of (25mg for 2 weeks then 50mg) Zoloft beginning 5/3/24. A month later, I switched to 10mg Lexapro cold turkey due to my provider’s recommendation because I wasn’t feeling better. Another month later 6/4/24, a new doc suggested I switch to 150mg Wellbutrin cold turkey 7/9/24 since I didn’t feel much different on Lexapro either. This doc said since I didn’t have any withdrawal symptoms cold turkeying from Zoloft to Lexapro I should be fine doing the same Lexapro to Wellbutrin. Today is my fourth day of being on Wellbutrin and I can positively say I feel significantly worse. I’m not sure if it’s symptoms of withdrawal or the Wellbutrin. I feel moody like when I PMS (sad, extreme loneliness) but on top of that I feel empty/hopeless in moments I’m alone. It’s making me anxious.

Thinking of ending it ,"I’m thinking of ending things tonight. I’ve struggled all my life with depression, I’ve worked through it with therapy and discovered coping mechanisms. 
But tonight is too much. I’ve worked through pain from childhood, long term relationship ending and my closest family member and best friend passing away. I spoke to my ex tonight, and have realised the love I felt for all those years was never reciprocated in the same way. One person who I thought really saw me for who I was, did, and decided I wasn’t enough. 
That’s not the reason to end things, but it just feels like the last straw. 
There are many things I love in this life. I know so many beautiful, kind and sweet people. But I can’t stay for them. I’m so tired of always being sad ",OkAcanthopterygii325,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2sdkc/thinking_of_ending_it/
why is it so hard to find treatment,I’m 16 years old and have been struggling with depression silently for years. My parents have been somewhat aware but only decided to get me help a few months ago. So many psychiatrist offices don’t have any availability. They had to call countless places and talk to a doctor just to find one that would see me. At this point I felt mostly past the point of being helped and was wary about getting my hopes up and being disappointed. But I couldn’t help the feeling deep inside me that thought this was my chance to finally get better. I’d dreamed of this day for years. We went to the first appointment and spoke to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and suggested I go on medication. She referred me to another psychiatrist in the office who was better suited for my needs and we set up my first session to be the week after. However the next week when we showed up we found out that the therapist I was supposed to see decided to take time off. I cried as soon as I got home. I was so disappointed. Despite my better judgement I truly believed I would finally get the help I desperately needed. I was so close. The little hope I had is gone and replaced with hurt. ,Historical-Habit4861,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e378zp/why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_treatment/

Antidepressants?,"I 20m have been wondering how i can get some antidepressants. I know people have to go to a doctor and get it prescribed. But I was wondering. If I have to go to a doctor or I can do it online. Or is there a way to make sure to get them. I’ve been having thoughts on ending it and I thought I should give medical drugs a try. I’ve smoked pot to deal with it but I can’t no more.

So I want to ask how do I do it specifically. Do I have to go to a clinic and if I do will I have to go again or will I get sent to a therapist or psychiatrist. If I do how do I pay for it. How would it works. I wish to keep it hidden from my parent at all cost. I know they would probably support me at going. But I physically cannot ask them for help. Is there a possibility to do it or is there no way to do it.

"I feel worthless, I think of killing myself so often now ","I’ve been going through a break up, but we still see eachother and do couple things. She tells me she is waiting for me to win her back, and I believe I try my best to do things and improve and show her I’m trying to do better. It’s been around a month now and I just feel so depressed. She treats me like trash most of the time, I feel like her slave and nothing more as I do everything she tells me to do, but I feel like all I am to her is an object to do her tasks for her. 

Recently I felt really down, suicidal, I told her I couldnt handle being in the same room as her and I stepped out to lay down by myself to collect my thoughts. After a while I realized the state that I was in I couldn’t stop thinking that way and I just wanted to cry alone and doze off. I let her know I would do this and she said it was okay with a sad face emoji. I knew this meant she wasn’t okay with it and she stopped responding to me all together. She tells me to be the bigger person in the relationship and at that moment all I could think about was how to make her feel better. I quickly got myself together for her sake and came back, she kept telling me why I came back and I told her it was because I was worried for her. Eventually she asked me why, I told her I was feeling suicidal again. She didn’t say anything to comfort me, or atleast I didn’t feel comforted. Then she went on to tell me how I made her mad and how I make her feel worthless because I don’t do enough for her. I just feel so unseen and honestly writing all this out makes me feel so selfish. 

My suicidal tendencies aren’t because of her or this, this definitely feeds onto it though. 

Just now she called me asking me where I put something she bought as a gift, I told her I didn’t know and after her searching everywhere she believes I left it in her old house. I told her to contact someone there to be given the chance to find it but she completely shuts me down. I offer to do it for her and she says it’s useless. I offer to pay for it and tells me I’m broke and she doesn’t want my money. 

I’m boarding a plane right now, she knows it, but she never told me to have a safe flight or anything like that. She got mad at me yesterday because I didn’t commute to her house one final time (I went to her house two days ago and woke up at 7:30 to commute back to something I needed to go to.) i feel like nothing I do right is ever considered. 

 
I just want to disappear or die gruesomely or something so my parent don’t have to witness me killing myself. I honestly would appreciate someone to talk to, I feel so alone. Or if you think I’m the one in the wrong tell me so I can realize it and I can change it.

I genuinely don't see a point anymore. I live in Australia and our poltics always reflect amercias so next year I'm sure libreal (right wing party) will win and get into parliment and even if they don't it will probably be labour (slightly less right wing)

I look at whats happening in gaza and Congo and ukraine and just can't process how the fuck I'm supposed to do anything to help.

I'm bi and nonbinary i was amab so already life is hard to a degree but i also live rural so if right wing parties get in all over the worlf my life is done for I'd have to go back to suppressing myself because the world just simply refuses to have empathy for people thay don't feel and look like them.

I'm also a musician but i suck ass most of my songs are just mish mashs of grunge songs i like and even ones i think i completely original end up sounding like another band. My lyrics are bland my guitar playing sucks .

Recently me and this girl i was helping cheat fell out and her bf at the time revealed how much she was lying to me about and i was fine with it because i didnt like him but after we sat down and talk i couldn't find reasons to hate him and i jjst feel so fucking guilty

Tricyclics and also quelling musculoskeletal aches?,"I somehow became interested if there were levels of free-floating sadness/gloom even more severe than depression/dysthymia, and came upon melancholia. While it doesn’t look like I match enough symptoms, I did note with interest on one page that it’s very frequently comorbid with musculoskeletal aches/pains.

I immediately thought of my own teleporting minor aches (i.e. on the 1-10 pain scale, they’re generally 1, or even 0.5). I’d even tried bupropion briefly because of them (bupropion apparently also helps with fibromyalgia, and I figured it might be worthwhile to try it even if this were better called *pseudo*fibromyalgia, in case the underlying causes were different but not the ending nature of the aches), but quickly decided it dried out my mouth too much to endure. Next noticed thing: Melancholia usually gets treated with tricyclics, not SSRIs or SNRIs.

Tenuous-looking, but after sertraline and escitalopram losing strength and my being unsure about my current fluoxetine, I wonder if a tricyclic could quell *both* my gloom and the pseudofibro…(I forget why I ultimately decided it wasn’t actually fibromyalgia -_- )",SkyknightXi,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3kn6v/tricyclics_and_also_quelling_musculoskeletal_aches/

Damn the consequences with not going to work, I just can't face the onslaught of tomorrow any more even after spending a month out sick this year and using all my leave.

The problem is, if I explain my living and employment situation it sounds normal to good but I have things going on in my life that mean I am taking a step backwards every day. If I am not perfect every single day then I don't get done what I need to and I am falling further into debt with myself. 

I am mentally fucked I can manage my mental health without work and work if my mental health is stable but I can't manage both, one takes priority and it's not me. but I do because that is what you are forced to do if you hide it well enough. I don't know how to explain it to people because they are not like me, they don't deal with this brand of hell where there are no good days.

I am a broken biscuit masquerading as functional. Many people tell me that this is just normal because they arent like me. They dont need to reign in a need to scream, or resist the urge to rip their skin off, tear themselves to peices and hope the doctors put them back together right this time. This is something i actively have to do. I need to reign in a mental breakdown almost every day, sometimes even multiple times a day just to make it to tomorrow.

Something is seriously wrong with me and I need some perspectives. ,"I don’t even know where to start.
I am in my late 20s and for the longest time, I have not been able to do much with my life or accomplish anything. 
A little background, I was good until highschool, I did more or less well academically and was pretty academically inclined, was considered smart and everything. The problem started when I finished highschool, I took a few years off(because of some issues) so I started college late, it already took a toll on my confidence and I felt too old and too late for everything. 

Eventually I finished college and I haven’t been able to accomplish anything else eversince. 
I blamed it all on my laziness, I rationalised myself blaming my failures on my laziness and lack of trying. 
But since last year, I really made a conscious effort to try. I really did try so hard mentally to focus on the task at hand, made small goals to accomplish, made a routine for myself. But I noticed that I could never focus on anything for more than 20 mins at most. Even though I would make a mental note to not let anything distract myself, I would find myself hours later being distracted by the smallest of things and would feel like shit for having wasted all those time and it would repeat all over again. 
I tried to lock my phone up somewhere far away from my room thinking it was the source of my distraction but my mind would still find something else to waste my time on. It became a mental torture at this point. 
It seems like I would rather do literally anything else than the task at hand it doesn’t even have to be enjoyable at that point. 
It’s like my mind has another mind of its own and i lose control of it. 
This has caused me some major distress. 

Another thing i’ve noticed that, nothing feels natural and comfortable to me. 
For example, even when i’m doing a simple task of doing laundry, holding my clothes or the jar of detergent feels uncomfortable and unnatural to me, like i’m not holding it properly or something. Everything I do feels wrong and uncomfortable. 


I just really need some perspective on this because i can’t access therapy at this point. 

Thank you to whoever read it till here.

I dont know how to live when I am better off dead.,"I live a fairly fine life, a good house, and food to eat, not rich or anything but not poor either. I am well-loved by my family so it amazes me why I push them away and can't show affection. Ever since I was a tween I have always felt some sort of misery. It was so sudden you would have thought a nefarious witch came and cursed me. I wouldn't consider myself a good person, quite the opposite actually. I have worked on getting better, disregarding my insensitivity, and bettering my inferiority complex but little has made a difference. Because even though I am extremely sensitive to others' feelings in a way, I tend to still be indifferent when they show me, love. I have no real life skills as a teenager as a result of being spoiled my whole life. Almost everything has been given to me in a platter, and I take it always with a grain of salt. I have fairly good friends, but I lost most of them because of my personality. During quarantine, my whole mentality rotated to a 360° I was badly influenced and out of control. And now that whole demented persona is just stuck. The main reason I want to die is because I feel like I am better off dead. I don't bring anything to the house instead of being a student and attending school. But other than that, I am truly a burden. I can't do house chores without people telling me to because I feel judged. I don't know why and how. My looks also play a part, I am extremely unsettling to look at, and I do not have the best personality either as mentioned. I have so many imperfections I don't even look human, no matter how much I try to see it. I feel like I disgrace the world just by existing. To add fire to the fuel, I don't have any good talents, I don't sing, or dance, and the best I could do is get an above-average grade in the class. It bothers me how I can be ""good"" but can't be the ""best"" in academics. The only passion I have is reading, I love to read. But of course, all good things come to an end, and I have been little by little reaching a slump. I don't know what to feel. I don't know what to do. 

It's like I am a body without a soul. Maybe I have been programmed this way my whole life, I cannot think of a single trauma that can cause this. I don't know what I did in my past life to end up in this state. I truly believe I am better off dead. 

I don't want anyone to pity me and I don't expect anyone to. I just wanted to get this off my chest and share my experience. To those who are experiencing the same thing, know you are not alone.",IllTransportation488,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e30y7k/i_dont_know_how_to_live_when_i_am_better_off_dead/
my boyfriend is making me suicidal,"my boyfriend is not abusive. he has been mean to me on many occasions but never hit me or emotionally abused me. he recently said he wanted to break up with me because we spend too much time together and he needs to grow as a person. we settled on taking a break. he said i can still talk to him when i want to. he still comes over and we cuddle. he said im not allowed to keep tabs on him and im not allowed to spend the night with him. he still asks me on dates or to hang out. i’m basically his gf without the commitment. but it is supposed to be temporary until he heals and figures things out. 

currently, he doesn’t answer my calls or text me. he is distant unless he thinks we can have sex. whenever i bring up that his control over every aspect of this relationship is making me miserable, he starts to threaten a complete break up again. when we do spend time together he basically leads me on. he tells me and he loves me and everything is going to be okay. we make future plans and i feel like everything is going to work out. but then he ghosts me all day. i have my own problems. i take care of his dog and cat. i have depression and anxiety and am currently struggling financially. i have no friends and my family doesn’t like me. everyday is a struggle. 

when he does talk to me on the phone, he always tells me things like he doesn’t want to be in a relationship with me. he constantly tells me that he doesn’t like to be around me. he tells me that he doesn’t miss me and that he doesn’t want to see me. he knows i have struggled with suicidal thoughts, depression, and anxiety. he is always flipping between saying he loves me and saying he doesn’t want to be around me. he makes me feel like i’m not worth it. he makes me want to kill myself. out of everyone who doesn’t want to be around me or love me, i never thought he would become one of those people. i don’t say anything to make him say this stuff. he just feels the need to. i feel like it’s manipulative for me to tell him that the things he says and how he is treating me is making me suicidal. but i just want to make him stop

I physically can’t enjoy anything anymore,"I got out of/stuck in an abusive relationship, not just with my estranged ex but also my entire family.  I’ve been tossed around quite often and used like filth and trash.

I seriously just want to ruin myself so badly, to let her ruin me, I can finally fucking end any more thinking—but I know that won’t solve anything.

Because this bitch, this woman I loved, who I thought I could trust, ruined my life, abuse me, and threw me away and not once—not once since she crawled into my life again—has she apologized.

I’m the crazy one, the obsessive one, the loser she graces with her presence while she cheats and lies and berates and belittles me and backstabs me repeatedly.  And I go back.  Like some beaten dog wanting to make the fucking whip master happy.

Give me truth.,"Harsh truths. Gentle truths. I need either at this point.

I have suicide plan ideas, no solid plan yet. I want to die. Hanging did not work back when I was 19, so don't wanna try that. OD is extremely difficult to do, I'm more likely to just get hospitalized for that. I do not like gore so don't want to expose that to someone by shooting myself with my step dads gun or jump off a cliff. On my list is either charcoal burning, jumping into a cold lake hoping for hypothermia/cold water drowning, or purposeful heat stroke (I'm a runner; I imagine this would be easy to do just not pleasant to experience). I know the biggest challenge is my body's natural desire to live, unfortunately.

At the same time I don't know if I am actually going to go through with it. Maybe I wrote out the plans as a coping mechanism - to know it is there in case things hit the fan more than they already have, such as my mom dying from cancer/complications of cancer.

I'm on vacation, without any actual plans. I'm just bopping around. Even on vacation I am painfully depressed. This isn't like me, I usually find adventure and fun in the smallest things and find great joy in the spontaneous and I romanticize the shit about everything and anything.

The other night, I could actually feel the emotional pain where I did not want to breathe anymore.

Some background about me: I have depression/anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD. I also have a clinical doctorate and do not dislike my job, but I'm also in 200k+ debt that will be forgiven if I die. I have been feeling quite isolated in the small town I've been in since last fall. My mom got diagnosed with late stage cancer and while she made it through chemo and radiation, she has been having toxic side effects from immunotherapy and recurrent respiratory failure episodes in which she has had 6 hospital admissions in the last month alone. I am not close to my dad or step dad. I feel lonely and I have no close friends. I'm scared of living a life without my mom. Without my aging cat. Without anyone. Life looks bleak. I'm tired of being the funny person and the one that looks out for people, but all alone once I'm at home. Silence is no longer comforting, but neither is music anymore. Nothing soothes the ache.

I do not enjoy what I usually do. I want to force myself to go out and trail run and boulder, things I love but I just do not anymore. I know these are textbook symptoms of depression. I have the logic to identify what is going on, but that does not make me feel better emotionally. I love the moon and sunsets and now when I look at them, I feel nothing. I have no interest in anything in life.

Yes this is a post for ""attention"" because I want to spend the next hour reading advice or insights to keep me distracted, genuinely. I have nothing else going on. I have plans to go through with this on either the 18th or 20th. But I also have a therapy appointment tomorrow too and yes I will let her know, maybe she will admit me.

It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it’s better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i’m the same as them, as if we’re all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it’s because their so mad at the other person’s opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn’t that mean you’ve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I’m not an object. I definitely take it too far though, punching the wall, screaming, and destroying things are not normal emotions. To top that off, I am stuck in a constant eating disorder, starved until I couldn’t, ate until I exploded, I prefer the skinny side of me, I liked my body at least. Back to sadness… I haven’t been able to explain it to anyone else what im feeling, to explain it on the deepest level I can, what I feel (maybe I’m being dramatic) is death, although I dont know what death feels like I assume its like getting old, or being on your death bed, my depression is like waiting to die, everyday not getting up to do anything, never being happy, not having anyone worry or miss you, that’s what death is overall. I seem normal on the outside, besides my arms (yes I mean that) but that’s only because if I cant even handle the beat down from myself, I dont know what’d I do if I had to endure hate from the outside world, that’s one of the scariest things in my opinion.",These_Tomorrow8510,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3uwwv/can_someone_acknowledge_that_im_real_please_tw/

"My manager makes me want to log off the life game, and I can’t escape him.","It’s been arguably one of my worst years ever. I caught my fiancé having a primarily gambling related set of emotional affairs, I was set to get a promotion and it was all a lie, my fiancé (who we decided to do couple’s counseling) lost two relatives in the span of two months so we have to put our problems on hold. I’ve had issues with the step-kids not caring for their brother and speaking ill of their mother and I during school to their father and step-mom. My son has been diagnosed on the spectrum and is nearly non verbal. One of our cars broke down and when we got it back it had more lights on it than dodger’s stadium. And the manager whose position I was supposed to fill as he made a lateral move to a different position has engaged in some strong micromanaging of me and my fiancé (as we work at the same job regrettably) and more or less bullied me by maliciously following the rules while himself being a hypocrite. Once lectured me for showing up less than half an hour late as “not properly representing management” and proceeded to be late every day the entire week. I had no issues with him being in the role that was initially set to be given to me, or that he chose to stay despite being offered to move. I loathe his poor treatment of my coworkers as I am a supervisor, and I despise how every shift with him is so draining that it directly affects my home life. 

Our house is in disarray, the lawn struggles to be maintained, im having a war in the kitchen with flies, and I barely replaced a broken garbage disposal that has caused the underside of our sink to warp. The roof has several leaks, our mortgage is barely maintained, my desk and hobby workspace is often filled with other people’s clutter, and don’t get me started on my social life. 

I just need to vent. I can’t catch my breath. And I had to delay both of my therapies for about a month just to save money. And above all, being a man, I don’t feel like because some of these issues aren’t that big a deal that people will tell me to just “get over it” and “be the bigger person” as if I haven’t always done that. I’m done. Being that person doesn’t protect my peace and if this manager looks at me sideways one more time before I find a new job, I’m just gonna dig my own grave because the things I feel like doing are gonna warrant that I no longer live anyway. Unfortunately for me, these are only feelings and I have no energy to exercise any of it so if push comes to shove, I’ll probably just shut up and quit like always and put on a smile on the way out the door. I don’t want to live anymore.

My therapist always tells me because I overanalyze everything to just look for what is real and what seems to be real is that nobody really cares that I exist, and I can simply be replaced for anything else within reach. I respect him for trying, but the world around me tries harder.",ThrowRA_latergamer,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2ivir/my_manager_makes_me_want_to_log_off_the_life_game/
Sorry mom,"I lost my twin brother when we were 7. It’s been  12 years now! After my sweet brother left this earth, I have had this urge to leave too.

My father used to say that when one twin d!es the other shall follow. I’m not sure if that is true anymore, but surely he must be right, since I have not truly smiled since I lost him.

 I can’t explain the type of grief I feel anymore.
Every birthday is a reminder of my loss and I feel guilty. I feel guilty for growing up!

I feel like he would have loved living, he would have loved growing up instead my parents lost their son and got stuck with a bipolar daughter.
Since I look identical to him all these years my mother couldn’t even look at me without crying.

She used to make me dress into his clothes when she would miss him asking me to tell her that he was okay. I haven’t existed since I lost him. I didn’t realise how much he protected me all these years and he even passed away protecting me. I feel guilty for how my mind is! 

If I could, I would change places with him; I want to change places with him. I feel like a ghost that stole another persons’ lifepath.

I had a best friend she was always there for me. She understood me and never made me feel like I needed to be someone else. I loved her existence everything about her was beautiful. I moved away and she passed at 15! 

It’s been 4 years now. I feel jealous of them, I know how messed up that is but I feel jealous. I miss her!

I have trouble keeping friends now (terrified if I am a curse) and maintaining relationships. I had someone in my life who loved me for me but of course even he got scared when I got into a depressive episode for the first time.

What’s the point anymore!? I am 19 years old and the thought of having to exist for another decate sounds dreadful enough.

I doubt my partner would keep them as if we weren’t together he would probably move back in with his mother (who has 5 dogs that hate cats). The only thing that feels like it’s keeping me here is my worry for my cats. I’m sorry for rambling but I’ve just been a deeply depressive state and had a break down about this.

sick of this life. ,"I doubt anyone will see this but I need to vent. I made this new page just to be able to say how I really feel without judgement.

 I’m sick and tired of this life. I’ve been through so much in life i could write a book and to top it off, my fiancé took his own life last year. I haven’t even hit 25 yet and my life feels ruined. ill never love someone the way I loved him. i’ll never get to have children now (pretty sure I can’t anyways due to endometriosis) or be married. i’ll never have my happily ever after (by choice, I refuse to find a new partner) i’ll never be the same person I once was.  

I’ve had on and off depression for years and i’m TIRED of it. i’m tired of faking like life is okay when it isn’t. i’m tired of hiding how I really feel. I’m miserable. I’ve tried taking my own life in dumb ways (OTC pills and eye drops, i know. dumb.) and of course I never took enough to cause actual damage. The worst part is i’m scared to do anything further because I don’t want to feel pain. It’s cowardly. Everyone says someone who truly wants to take their life will just do it, but it’s hard. This isn’t a cry for help, it’s just how i really feel. 

Every time i’ve tried, I got so sick and regretted it simply because I was still alive and throwing up. Never went to the hospital for any of my attempts. I suffered in my room in silence. My 2nd to last attempt I research for hours on drinking Visine (yes, the eyedrops). I drank 6 bottles and guess what? Nothing. I felt like I was nodding out and two days later I was back to normal. I was in the car with my friends and they didn’t even notice meanwhile my heart rate was slowing and i was losing hearing a bit. i fell asleep in my car and woke up hours later still alive. Why is it so hard?

 I hate expressing how I feel because then everyone looks at you like a charity case or says how ungrateful you are. I have been on depression meds, hate them. I won’t talk to a therapist or anything because advice doesn’t help me. I will fake like it does but it truly doesn’t. I’m so tired of being here!!! I’m so so fucking tired. “It gets better” Yes, it does for some people but i’m not one of them. I’ve had suicidal ideations daily for YEARS. I want to swallow all the pills I have right now but I can’t even fathom the fact of ANOTHER failed attempt and getting sick. Worst case scenario waking up in a hospital room with my family crying wondering what they could do differently. 

I miss my fiancé, I want to be with him. I don’t want to feel this pain anymore. I’m so miserable and there’s only one way out but it’s so hard to reach. It sounds sick but I pray every day that someone with a terminal illness and I can switch places. I would do it in a heartbeat. There’s so many people who want to live and don’t get the chance, why can’t I take their spot? I’m not selfish, I know how it sounds but it’s just how my brain is wired.

Please help. Is this a depression issue?,"Been together for just over 10 years. Husband was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when he was a teenager (Domestic violence). He's taking meds now. We've had couple's therapy from Dec to April this year.

Normally, he's an introvert, low energy but jokes around with me and communication is not an issue, very kind and mild person. If he's down, he plays some video games, watches some game videos he likes then he gets better.

The issue is when we argue about something. He either likes to blame me, and completely talking about his side. (If I focus on his side, he says something and I reply, no problem, we can communicate back and forth) But if I want to talk about my side after he's done his side, he either loses focus gets drowsy or even fall asleep, or tells me it's wrong, or calling me delusional or saying blaming me for making no sense, etc.)

Usually that gets me very frustrated and emotional then the argument gets more escalated and he either loses control calling for a divorce or leaves the house.

Today he took it out on me when the dog bit him. I said ""Don't take it out on me."" He started accusing me for not punishing the dog enough, etc. Anyways I tried to leave the conversation before it got bad. (I just said Don't talk to me until you're calm.)

In the past, i was the one that couldn't take the silence and always tried to make an nice gesture or apologize (I don't want to do that anymore. I'm so tired)

Could you help me?

1. What should i do?
2. Is his behavior depression related? (I've dealed with this issue for years and years and I'm so tired, but at the same time no other issue when we don't fight.

Usual comforts not working,"A couple months ago I got super sick and almost died and had an amazing recovery, during the month that followed I had such a clear mind, happiest I’ve ever been and had such a zest for life. After that I’ve been slowly devolving back into my old self. I’m both miserable and miserable to be around. I have such a hard time conceptualizing what I felt then and it makes me feel even worse bc I got a taste of what everyone feels like and now that I’m back to normal I’m constantly reminded of what life could be and how hard it is for me to grasp it. I’m usually a passive suicidal ideation girl but even THOSE thoughts were gone! 
I remember actively thinking about how I can never let myself get back into old thought patterns bc I can clearly see how life is worth living. It’s so frustrating bc I could so easily tell the INSTANT I started being depressed again. Nothing even triggered me today I just literally cannot see past wanting to die and finally freeing everyone around me from the burden of knowing me. I have friends, I live with my partner of years, I just can’t convince myself I’m not unlovable and that they’re all secretly conspiring against me and all deeply hate me. I can’t even use my usual excuse to not end it which is that my partner would be sad that I’m gone bc I’m convinced she is over it and over me and that she deserves someone who’s not so hard to love. 
Past few months I’ve also been so excited bc I’m seeing some of my favorite bands in the fall, I literally tell myself “you can’t kill yourself you’re seeing X” and it often really works as a silly way to help me cope but it’s not working.

 I don't know how to explain to my mom that I just want her to stop nagging me at the moment. ,"I am currently in college for computer science. This is the first break that I haven't taken extracurricular classes. I took both winter and summer classes just to catch up in my degree because there's an expectation to already have a lot of credits by default in order to graduate in 4 years. Despite this, I'm behind by about a semester worth of classes. 

I live at home and commute 50 minutes both ways everyday because renting is just so expensive. My mom has told me things before, like that college wasn't that bad for her. I don't think she realizes the difference in degree difficulties. She went to school for teaching. Her job is probably harder than mine will be but at the moment, what I'm doing is just a lot more mentally taxing. 

Everyday I come out of my room, and she tells me that I should get a job and am being lazy, but this is literally the only mental break I've had for years and feel like I'm being bullied anytime I come near her.

I literally hate everyone and everything (Long Post) ,"This is gonna be a long post and it’s probably not gonna be well written so bear with me. Reddit is the only non biased place I can vent and seek advice at the same time. 

I am an angry person. I hate everyone and everything. I have no idea why.

My childhood was good I guess. I feel like my parents did a good job raising me. I wasn’t spoiled but I did have more opportunities than my peers. I am an only child. So I can’t think of any childhood trauma that would cause my anger issues. The only thing that maybe would have anything to do with it is when I was in high school I was the kid everyone picked on but tbh it didn’t really bother me because I didn’t like anyone anyways lol

I didn’t start noticing how much of a hostile person I am until I reached adulthood. At 19 I bought my first home, had a good job, good friend group, etc. I did develop an alcohol problem but got it under control after my DUI when I was 24. I still drink occasionally but only when I’m home. There is no correlation between my anger and alcohol. Just wanted to add that for context on my life. I have the smallest fuse. If someone looks at me the wrong way I’m ready to kill them. I can’t count on my fingers and toes the amount of times I’ve plotted someone’s death in my head. 

I’m now 29 and it’s like the anger is full force. I’m happily engaged to the love of my life and he is literally the best person in the world. He’s very patient and understanding and non judge mental. What’s crazy is I’ve felt like I’ve gotten more angry in the last 3 years we’ve been together. But it has nothing to do with him or anything he’s done. He has a great career as do I so financials aren’t an issue. I used to be an extrovert now I can’t stand to leave the house. I can’t stand to be around people because people are fucking stupid. If someone says something stupid it will send me into a rage. If someone is loud/obnoxious I imagine hurting them. I love the thought of beating the shit out of someone who messes with me.

Here’s where it turns into depression. I will get so mad about something so minute and after I blackout from shear anger I beat myself up because once I calm down I’m embarrassed for myself at how mad I get. I do have a history of suicidal thoughts and 1 attempt (during my alcohol abuse). Generally when I do get angry it doesn’t turn physical. I don’t put my hands on people. It pretty much gets compartmentalized. 

My biggest problem is I don’t have any non religious connections that I can properly seek help from. 

I got extremely angry tonight. I had one of the most violent outbursts I’ve had in a while. It started with my DoorDash order. It was wrong. I got pissed. Then I was playing a video game. Game lagged out and I lost all my progress. Rage quit. Decided to go take a shower because I figured that would make me feel better. Went to wash my hair and I was out of conditioner. I then threw all the bottles out of the shower. My fiancé has a little mirror in the shower and I almost punched it when I saw my reflection. 

I’m to the point where I hate myself. I can’t lose weight because of my hormones I’m on from a hysterectomy in 2019. I’m not an obese person just slightly overweight. My sleep is being affected because of my anger turns depression. I’m too afraid to take sleeping meds because I already don’t hear my alarm clock in the mornings. I’m constantly stressed or mad about something. Those suicidal thoughts are coming back and it scares tf out of me. 

Now I’m mad I can’t fix me.

Nothing is Fun Anymore,"I swear,  nothing will make me feel anything at this point. I feel like I'm just draining everyone around me; like I'm ruining everyone else's time. I have become Tweak from South Park; just quieter because I'm terrified of being loud and noticed.

I am weeks away from turning 27 and I have done nothing in my life to show for it. I have no friends, I have no job because there is literally nothing I can see myself doing that won't mentally exhaust or siphon the life out of me. I have had like 9 jobs and every single one made me want to die. I do have income in the form of Employment Insurance. 

I play video games all day so that my bad thoughts aren't as intense - but I fucking hate every second of it. I get zero pleasure. Victory Royales mean nothing; platinuming a Souls game means nothing... just repetition so my anxious thoughts don't get too out of whack.

And before you suggest ""getting out,"" my front entrance is everyone else's backyards. I live in a basement apartment and I have a douchey neighbour above me and crackhead tough guys next door. All eyes are on me and fucking hate it. No matter what, somebody is always outside and I can't fund nowhere else to live because there is a housing crisis where I currently am. Especially now that scumbag homeowners discovered Airbnb and that they can make more money nightly than renting to someone monthly. 

My parents got me tickets for a Billy Talent concert so that I can maybe feel something... and nothing. Everyone is literally doing everything to make me smile and I feel so disgusting and guilty for not being able to just smile for them.

I want out. This isn't fun anymore. I literally am at a point that I'm trying to re-home my bunny because I cannot be there for him mentally and he's just in his enclosure all the time and I just panic now when I let him out. He doesn't deserve this and I can't even find someone that will give him the life I can't provide. I may be in a prison, but this bun doesn't have to be. I often talk to him and say things like ""we're not so different"" because this apartment has become my enclosure.

The story of someone you don't know ,"Last 10 years I felt like I'm skipping on everything in life. My young years is so... I don't know how to even say this... Painful.

I don't want to die. I want to live. From what I can see life can be beautiful... Just not mine. 

First I was incredibly shy. With time I managed to overcome it but then COVID hit. This will sound bad but I gotta be honest. 2020 was the best year for me in the last ten years. I found my first good job, got masters in physics, spend a bunch of time with my friends playing games. It was fun.

Then something majorly changed. Every new day I felt like death is coming and I couldn't understand what it is. I ignored it for about a year until it got so so bad. I couldn't sleep, not a one single good or positive though visited my brain. Level of tiredness was way to high to do basic tasks on the job. I decided to go to psychiatrist since I understood that something was very wrong.

Long story short I got diagnosed with GAD or generalized anxiety disorder. 2 years of treatment and it got a bit better to the point that doctors allowed to stop taking meds. I've felt fine for the first time in 3 years, but obviously those 3 years I was absent from normal life. At that moment I felt like I'm missing something. No relationship, no strength to pursue it, no desire to chase it.

Then happened something way worse than I could imagined. War in my country. It's not a political post so I won't talk it from the point of politics. My mental declined with massive speed, to the point that I've felt again that fear of death on a whole new scale. I knew that I could be drafted at any moment and with my health problems (stomach and spine problems) I knew I will not survive on the battlefield.

Now it's 3 years of war. This whole time I see funerals of young and old, men, women and most scary - children. I don't remember who said war is hell but that person was right. I never ever would wish something like this even to my worst enemy. Too bad my worst enemy happy that this is happening.

Now I'm looking at my life with understanding that even not on the battlefield I can die at any moment. And question myself ""what my life even was for?"". I have no family, kind, woman I love, solid salary, my own home or something to go towards. Some of my friends are dead or badly wounded. If I parishes right now, what did I even left? 

This post is not about asking for help, politics or something like that. This is just something I needed to get of my chest.

I don't know my future. I know my past. I know myself. And I don't like what I am. 

Maybe I will have a chance to send invites to my best friends for my wedding one day. Maybe I will see my kids being brought to life. Maybe I will be able just to enjoy life with someone I love.

Or maybe I will die soon and nobody will ever remember I existed.",LaudanumOn,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4tu2g/the_story_of_someone_you_dont_know/

"Things got better, and I didn't because I'm still alone.","I used to be in a pretty bad place, in just about every regard, terrible job, bad money situation, could barely engage with my hobbies, no romantic attachment, and no path forward.

In the past year so many things have gotten better. I'm making a little more money, I have a job that isn't perfect, but one I don't hate, and that isn't really taxing physically or mentally. I have my own apartment and it's not evern an especially crappy one.

Even though so many things have gotten better, I'm still alone. I don't like my family, I have a few friends that I enjoy being around and that I hang out with, but there is a gaping hole that I can't fill because I've never had any real genuine love in my life.

I thought that even though I can't find love, that improving everything else would make me feel better.

I am surrendering ,"I am 29m severe depression, PTSD, ADHD and anxiety. I fought my way and got a good career and immigrated to Europe. I tried meds, weekly therapy, going out, events, meeting people, gaming, even several posts, everything I can.

I lost desire to do anything and have no want to do anything. The healthcare system in the Netherlands is very stressed and can't do more for an expat. I don't have the courage to suicide. 

So I will just surrender. I will stay in bed looking at the ceiling doing nothing unless I have to go to the doctor or do some work. Take showers only if I would inconvenience others. I will use excuses to push the few people in my life away. Set up some papers in case I die. Just give up on living and wanting to live. Stay in a catatonic state.

Psychiatrists, therapists, suicide line workers, friends, family, strangers, no one really cares and will be agitated if whatever magic wisdom they throw at me don't work. From compliments to encouragement to blame to advice, it's all hollow.

"If the people who abuse me could feel the same pain that I feel, they'd kill themselves ","If my abusers could feel what I feel on a daily basis, they'd kill themselves. I'm honestly surprised I even made it to the age I am now, it's probably thanks to maladaptive daydreaming, but still.

The past year or so I have severely lost confidence in myself yet everything “seems” to be going great for me. I’m sad, demotivated and not happy at all. I feel stuck, and lately have even been struggling to get up in the morning and go to work. I just sleep. I know I’m starting to scare my partner, because this is not me. My dog sleep next to me, I think he can also tell I’m not okay. What do I do? ",YogurtclosetAble9256,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1dvid/am_i_depressed/

Idk what to do,"I'll start by saying im 25 years old, I have two young children with my girlfriend. We live in a trailer and a month and a half ago, I lost my job. I worked a very dangerous job where i picked up an addiction from substances my boss and other coworkers put me on to during my time working with them, not to say they are the reason for my addiction, but they introduced me to that specific drug. After a long period of time struggling with that addiction I was finally able to let go of it for a couple weeks before I got into an argument with my boss in which resulted in my job loss. My house is falling apart, the bills keep coming, my girlfriend is the only one working despite my constant efforts to find work. I've applied to so many places indiscriminately. Fast food, walmart, I have even knocked on hundreds of doors trying to sell yardwork. I dont know what I'm doing wrong, what kind of impression I must be giving off for this to happen. I feel like a complete failure, I have no family thats outside of prison to talk to or beg for help and my girlfriends family is not well off enough to provide any assistance. I feel like me dying would be the most beneficial thing that could happen for my kids, for them to have someone that isnt weak or someone that can provide the life i always wanted for them. I wanted so bad to be that person but years keep passing and the feeling of uselessness that I am is just building. I still haven't used the drug that had a grip on me and dont plan to, not before i kill myself.",ProblemChance8533,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3ek8r/idk_what_to_do/
