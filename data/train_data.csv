I’m stuck and I can’t do this anymore,"Honestly I felt so stupid and dramatic writing all this but I’ll post it anyway because idc anymore. 

I’ve been depressed and feeling suicidal for about 3 months now but things have gotten majorly worse in the past couple weeks. I don’t know how I make it through every day, I’m so bored and there’s nothing I enjoy anymore. The only reason I’ve made it until now is my family and my dog. However my family are going on holiday without me in 2 days. This is like the 5th time they’ve done it because I have severe anxiety and I can’t go with them. This time though, I REALLY need them. I’ve tried expressing what I’m feeling and had the help of my mental health worker too but they’re going anyway. My MH worker thinks they should go too and I’ll cope better than I think I will. I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they’re the only thing keeping me going. And while they’re away my dog is going to the kennels because I can’t even look after her by myself. 

I’ve expressed these thoughts mostly to my MH worker who has relayed them to my family but my family don’t understand why I can’t tell them these things myself. I’ve told them it’s very difficult. I’ve expressed the fact I want to die to all of them (MH worker and family) and I felt like they under reacted. Maybe they think I’m being dramatic and I wouldn’t actually do anything, which was true up until now but now I’m in such an awful place I don’t trust myself not to try to hurt myself or kms. Tonight I self harmed for the first time. I didn’t do much and am too much of a wimp to be honest but I had an urge to do it. I feel like I’m a manipulative bitch because it feels like the urge came from me wanting them to see how bad things are. I still have the urge to do more but like I said, I’m a wimp. Anyway I feel like if I tell my parents, everything will blow up. They get so stressed out about me and I know they need a break but I can’t survive that right now. I honestly feel so stuck. Dying seems like the only way out. 

I’ve also had intrusive thoughts about hurting other people. Like I said, I don’t trust myself. I would never do anything like that in my right mind but clearly I’m not in my right mind right now and I’m worried I’ll go crazy and snap. I genuinely don’t know what to do. If I don’t let my family go I feel like they’ll resent me. But it’s not like there’s even any way I can make them not go. So therefore suicide seems like the only way out. But nobody believes I would do that. I’m so stuck. ",imaginaryability41,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3hhwp/im_stuck_and_i_cant_do_this_anymore/

4 years of depression and lost confidence.,"

I'm just tired,I'm tired of everything waiting for that one happy day out of the month I'm just tired. I'm here for everyone else still while being broken to pieces. Working the day after my rape bc my coworker friend encouraged me to continually struggling. Getting told to get over it 2 weeks after it happened by my coworker friend. Dragging myself out of bed just to work. Just to eat n go to bed. My hobbies don't make me happy anymore. The worst part is the false sense of happiness then being struck down again.

My anxiety is at 21 out of 10 and it's all my fault,"I've written this post twice now after taking too long and losing it.  I'm going to be as brief as possible, while still trying to cover everything.  Mainly the advice I need is at the end.

I've been with my (46M) girlfriend (36F) for 3 and a half years.  I haven't been a good boyfriend.  I've lied about some pretty big things, and I've compounded lie on top of lie.  I was previously married in a loveless and toxic marriage that I am still struggling to end, but I lied to her and told her that it was final.  When she asked to see the decree, I continued to lie, delaying the inevitable. She knows now, and even though the divorce arbitration is moving forward, it doesn't fix the lies.

I had a close friendship with someone from my previous job, that was inappropriate.  Really inappropriate.  It wasn't cheating, physically or emotionally, neither of us wanted anything like that, but we did exchange racy and sexual text messages with each other, memes and pornographic pictures from the internet, nothing ever personal, and some of this did overlap into the beginning of my relationship with my girlfriend.  My girlfriend found out and I deleted all the messages from my phone, out of shame, and fear, and disgust with myself.  I forgot that they were even there because it had been so long ago, but once she found one of them, it all came back and I panicked.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to restore them so she can read them all and get closure.

We are trying to work things out, I think most of the work needs to be done by me.  I am in therapy, both personal and couples', trying to be better.  My psychologist wants to diagnose me with Borderline Personality Disorder, but I'm not sure that completely explains everything.  It's a work in progress.  I just want to move forward and I don't want to lie ever again, and I want everything to go back to normal.

That's where the anxiety is.  I overthink and I self-punish.  I go from 0 to 1000 at the drop of a pin and I am inconsolable.  I am terrified that I'm losing her, that I have already lost her, that she's going to find someone else less problematic.  And part of me knows that that probably would be the best thing for her, to be loved by someone that would never lie or hurt her.  It would end me though.  It would completely destroy me.  She tells me that she still loves me, and still wants to be with me, and make this work, but she can never trust me again.  Even if we work through all this, I can't see how she ever could, and I don't blame her.  Not one bit.  And without trust, how can there be love?  Real love?  And in my head, I don't know if she really needs ME or does she just need someone, and am I in the way?  She wants to meet new people, for friendships and I agree that she should.  I think she should get out and find that support system that I'll never be comfortable finding for myself.  She says that she's not looking for dates, or someone new, or even casual throwaway sex to fill the void that I caused, but that fear exists.  I know how special she is, even if she doesn't, and I know other people will see it too.  And I'm going to lose her, if I haven't already.

We have ups and downs.  Some days we are still madly in love and all over each other physically.  Some days are the complete opposite, cold, quiet, filled with hurt.  It's the yo-yo that hurts the worst, and causes the most anxiety.  Waiting for the shoe to drop that she found someone.  That it already happened.  And it's over.  It eats at me inside and I can't seem to make it stop.  I go for days without eating or drinking, sleeping.  I've lost over 15 pounds in two weeks and my clothes don't fit anymore. I just don't know how to stop accelerating things in my own mind, or how to stop hurting myself and focus on trying to fix the here and now.  I was on Paxil 10mg once a day for a while, but they don't work and I'm pill avoidant anyway.  I don't know what to do and I need help and I feel like I don't deserve any.  I want her and I feel like I don't deserve her.",Forsaken_Bat_5729,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3xzy1/my_anxiety_is_at_21_out_of_10_and_its_all_my_fault/
The cycle isn’t talked about enough,"Hi all,

Pretty much done with life rn. One thing people often mention, but I do not think emphasize enough, is how badly depression feeds into itself. 

I went all in on my last relationship of 3.5 years. I got depressed like 8 months in (not her fault) and slowly kept burning all kinds of bridges around me. 

When she decided her bridge was no longer meant for me, I realized I am a completely solitary island now. 

Was I fine with it for awhile? Yea. Do I still feel safe when I’m alone? Yea. But anyone who’s been here will tell you deep down they wish they had a support system but it’s so difficult to start from scratch. 

It’s wild how easily I made friends when I *already had* tons of friends. same with women. 

So now, yea, in a couple quick years I went from having a dreamy life to having no people on Earth who care about them. The physical toll has shown too, as I’ve lost about 30-35 lbs (already skinny). 

Really really don’t know where to go. I’ve tried reaching out to old friends, it’s mostly unsuccessful and quite soul crushing. Any advice? I fantasize about the big end every night rn.",PlasticHot7188,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3hdnb/the_cycle_isnt_talked_about_enough/

Muddled thoughts on intent,"Not a long rant cause I have tried to explain this to friends and family but they dont understand what I mean, and why i cant just let go.

I am obsessing over the intent of my own actions. Weather im nice because im \*actually\* nice, or am I just subconsciously behaving in such a way that makes me likable. And ontop of this I've been making massive mistakes, and hurting people i really care about. I hate even to be angry or upset with people, let alone actually inflict any emotional or physical harm.   
Im pushing everyone away cause I dont want to hurt them, and Im afraid to talk to people cause I feel so two faced if im just behaving in ways that make me likable.

Again, I know it sounds stupid to be hung up on things like that because life happens, and every person wants to be liked (as I have been told numerous times). But i just cant let it go.

A friend suggested I might have a type of OCD called Moral Scrupulosity, and it fits really well with how ive been feeling for the past year, but I dont want to self diagnose or claim anything cause I could be far off.

NEED HELP / ADVICE - my sister has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression,"my sister is 29 atm, I'm 23m. Diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and OCD when she was around 24-25, she has improved somewhat but used to fight with our parents, scream, break things, and verbally abuse us. She has expressed thoughts to end her life. In college, she had friends but cut off close ones after disagreements. Post-college, despite my dad investing in an office for her, she didn’t work and remains jobless with a disrupted sleep routine.

Frequent fights arose because she opposed my opinions, even when others agreed. My parents now stay silent to avoid conflict. I moved to another floor with my grandmother to reduce fights, but she still feels disrespected by me. She demands respect and acts like a second mom, complicating our sibling relationship. My parents have apologized for her childhood, but her inactivity seems to cause her to focus on past grievances.

She's seen many therapists, but only a few helped temporarily. She stops attending if faced with reality checks. She practices Reiki and other healing but behaves oppositely during arguments. I want to help but fear triggering more conflicts. Counselors suggest regular therapy, but she doesn't go. if we tell her a second time she starts to fight. We need advice on helping her improve her life without causing more conflicts.

Why are people so obsessed with keeping the fact that they don’t like me away from my knowledge?,"I’ve experienced this with people I’ve only known for a while, and people I’ve known for years. It seems like people just love to play with my emotions, make me think we’re still friends and on good terms but in reality they wouldn’t blink an eye if something happened to me, they ignore me and any attempts to communicate, and only initiate contact with me if they need something. It makes me hate myself even more than I already do. What did I do wrong? Why did you stop liking me and enjoying my company? What is wrong with me? Should I even be here anymore if everyone’s just gonna treat me like I’m disposable anyway? And the sad thing is, I still hold love for those people.

It's not easy.,"People like to tell me to just ""Be confident"" and other such commands but it's not possible if you don't have someone in your life who you can trust and let you know/help you believe that you have something. Something good, something worth loving, worth working hard for.

angel,"i’m such a kind and soft and gentle person. people come up to me and call me an angel and tell me i’m a nice calming presence. 

and then my brain sees that same kind, gentle thing and is reminded of its birth-given curse to destroy anything that can’t defend itself. i know how to be kind because i know how to be cruel. i know the pain of all the terrible mean things i could say to anyone else, because i’ve inflicted every single ounce of that pain on myself. 

it’s like when a cat sees a fish in a bowl. a boy sees an ant. a hawk sees a kitten. there’s that need to torture and kill something so defenseless. it’s a part of the circle of life. sadly, for me, it’s the curse of being the predator and the prey. i’m too kind to hurt anything else, but something needs to hurt. i have to be the destroyer and the destroyed.

He doesn’t want me to open my windows and I’ve tried using candles and ozium and nothing seems to stick. It’s not me as I’ve gotten better at showering everyday so really have no idea what to do. If I  don’t do something about it he’s gonna clean my room for me and throw stuff away.

My life is a complete joke…,"To be fair, I have a lot of things to be grateful for. I’m not starving and I have family that cares enough to let me at least stay with them again (though I’m afraid of my mental health tanking with them). I’ve had bad mental health issues since I was 12 years old, that was my first time attempting to harm myself and feeling like dying. I had bad internalized homophobia over liking women and I had to get over that recently. I ended up dating a guy during covid in college summer of 2020. I don’t want to say he was completely abusive. I was horrible and toxic in my own way due to my own traumas, and there are things I should’ve never done, like be overly jealous and threw things he bought me away out of spite, or dropping his toothbrush on the bathroom floor rug after an argument, which I immensely regret because it turns out it could’ve caused bad illness, as well as having a meltdown in front of him which caused him to freak out. But the sexual stuff really fucked me up and how I see my body. I learned after telling people I was definitely raped…and gaslit into thinking I wasn’t. I even feel weird saying that because it doesn’t feel real. I thought I was making it up as an excuse to act mentally ill. He did things that I didn’t consent to on more than one occasion. And shamed me into feeling like crap for asking him to…ask. I explicitly said no when trying to do my homework. I pretended to be ok with the sudden fingering. Then I said no sex tho. Then he just kinda did it. And I pretended to be ok with it. Afterwards I just cried in the shower and kept thinking about it when I was trying to do my homework. It wasn’t just that. I realized he would constantly sexualize me. He didn’t really give a fuck about my hobbies or interests or playing cool games together. The worst time was when I was trying to show off a lego set I got for christmas, after my dad was arrested for a dui (I was supposed to talk to him about his alchoholism but didn’t wanna ruin christmas so I felt like it was my fault). He said he didn’t give a fuck and asked me to flash my tits, which I did hesitantly. I took nudes of myself for him and he threatened to break up two days after that. I was basically personal jerkoff material and felt sexually humiliated. I was also pressured into sex in my own car in the beginning of our relationship. I never really got support from my mom after telling her. I guess she just wanted me to not let it affect my academic performance. I know I could’ve stayed home, but I felt so guilty for letting it affect me and wanted to prove I wasn’t broken. I didn’t want to be seen as a failure because of what happened to me. Plus, I don’t feel completely safe around my family. One of the biggest things keeping me in that relationship was thinking I was receiving love and praise that I hadn’t gotten from my family in years. I went through a bad hypersexual phase, thankfully online though, realized I was a lesbian, but the feelings around how much I hate my body and especially being female are surfacing. I keep feeling like I should be a boy instead now. Ever since I left that relationship I keep having new identity crisis themes or anxieties that I have to constantly think about or else I feel something bad will happen. I feel like such a different person. I look at the person I was before that relationship. I was depressed and mentally ill as well as undiagnosed autistic at the time, but I was so excited to finally get out of my household. Now I even feel like I’ve developed gender dysphoria. I can’t stand my useless body. I need to be on meds and therapy again. I feel so angry with everyone who was supposed to help and support me.

coming up on 20 solid years of unrelenting depression ,"i’m turning 31 very soon and it’s really starting to sink in that my depression is almost of legal drinking age. 
when i try to explain to most people that it’s not just being sad sometimes, it doesn’t go away, talking doesn’t help much, etc, it’s always the same reactions: “well it’ll go away” “when X changes, then you’ll feel better” “you just have to get through this bout”. how do you really explain to someone that you’ve wanted to die every single day (sans not a single day) since i was 11 years old. it seems unfathomable for most people which leads me to believe i might be actually crazy. 
it is very strange to me that i don’t know anyone else in my personal life who seems to struggle as intensely as myself and with as many frequent suicidal thoughts. 
it doesn’t seem to matter what is happening in my life, where my career is headed, how many friends i think i have.. the sum of all the parts still seems to equal zero.

Time is up,"I have a good life on paper.   I'm educated, have a good job, good friends, and a good family.  The problem is that I am 47 years old and can't seem to find a lasting relationship. I'm also not very attractive.  I meet women who swear up and down that they love me and want to grow old with me.  I think they fall in love with me because I make them laugh, and I'm good in bed. Things are usually good for a while, and then they leave.  I have been dumped twice via text by live in partners.   Recently, I got engaged, and now my fiancee is unsure about the relationship.   She took her ring off.  We had some stressors in our relationship. She wouldn't talk to me about it, and instead, gave me the silent treatment.  I talked to one of my friends about it because I needed an ear and advice.  I needed some comfort and to figure out how to fix things.    This angered my fiancee.  She didn't appreciate me airing our dirty laundry to someone else, which is a fair complaint.   I should have kept my feelings to myself.  Anyway, it appears I have failed at yet another relationship because she requested I keep my distance from her, and I have.  I've mostly isolated myself in one of our bedrooms, only emerging to walk the dog or go to work.  I have not engaged in conversation or even initiated any text messages.  The last time we had an actual conversation she told me she feels I don't listen to her.  I waited until she was done talking and summarized what she said.  I even asked if my summary was correct. She said it was.  Later on she texted me saying she is taking her ring off because she is unsure about the relationship.  I really thought I had gotten things right this time.  The biggest problem is that there's a child involved, and I love him too.  I have been a step mom to him for nearly 2 years. The thought of losing both of them is devastating.  I get it, though.  I'm just not good enough of a person to deserve love. It feels like I'm unworthy. I feel despondent. I haven't talked to anyone about this because I don't want her to feel like I'm airing our dirty laundry to any of our friends. Instead, I'm airing it here, I guess.   I'm not even sure why.  Maybe I'm hoping if I let it out, it will help?  I just don't know.   I don't feel like I have anything to lose at this point, and I don't feel like life is worth living anymore.  What's the point of it all?    Anyway, I have 800 units of regular insulin ready to go.   Thanks for reading.

I just don't see the point ,"I just really don't. I'm a 21 year old female and I've tried for years to give myself stupid reasons to stay alive. ""It gets better"" wasn't cutting it anymore so I was telling myself stuff like ""I want to see season 2 of this show I love. I need to see if my theories were correct, I can't die yet"", ""I'm so looking forward to the next spider verse movie I can't go yet"", ""Oh I can't die till the broncos make the playoffs"" or ""I have to see the broncos win another Superbowl! I could achieve immortality with that wait"" 

Just these last months have just been hard. My eating disorder has come back aggressively, and I know subconsciously it's my suicide, the suicide I can control. I want to die I don't eat. I want to live I eat. 

 I feel my friends couldn't give a shit about me. My cat ran away and not one friend could be bothered to talk to me to help me through it. I went through a death last year. Same thing not one friend cared. I'm always the back up friend. I'm the friend people only give a shit about when everyone is busy. 

I took a year off of college to get a job but I can't get any job and I've applied for over 20 jobs. I keep seeing articles talking about how no one wants to hire Gen z so now I'm panicking no one will hire me ever.

 So I'm sick of being sick, I feel like none of my friends could care less if I died, I feel like a deadbeat failure that I can't get a job and an idiot because I was at best a C student in school. I know people go through worse so I feel like a bigger POS I feel this way. 

I have a really hard time talking about these things in real life because I either want to avoid this topic like the plague or joke about it like it doesn't bother me. I kinda did it a little in this post with the ""immortality"" comment. I feel like it makes it harder for people to understand I need help because I can't say it. I can only say it to a bunch of strangers I know I'll never meet.

I give up,"I want to give up.

I'm 15. For a third of my life I've been battling with depression. For all that time, my mother verbally abused me about my mental health. The first time I was admitted to the pysch ward, she didn't visit me the entire time. I didn't get any diagnosises or medication due to her wishes.  The second time, last time, I was put onto a treatment order to basically force my mum into giving me treatment. We went to this mental health tribunal and she said that made her realise that I had issues.   
  
I'm discharged now. My mum's acting weirdly nice, saying that we both hurt each other (me telling people she was abusive and having mental breakdowns) and that we should move on. I'm taking medication, which she supervises. But I'm so done. I don't have the strength to keep on going, to keep on fighting. I think the last straw was my discharge, where I literally locked myself in the bathroom and screamed that I didn't want to go home. But they made me.

I just wanna stop taking meds, stop going to therapy, and wait out my chance to kill myself. But for the first time ever, I felt pleasure and genuinely smiled. But I'm done. I'm sorry, but I'm done. I'm so so done.

It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it’s better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i’m the same as them, as if we’re all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it’s because their so mad at the other person’s opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn’t that mean you’ve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I’m not an object. I definitely take it too far though, punching the wall, screaming, and destroying things are not normal emotions. To top that off, I am stuck in a constant eating disorder, starved until I couldn’t, ate until I exploded, I prefer the skinny side of me, I liked my body at least. Back to sadness… I haven’t been able to explain it to anyone else what im feeling, to explain it on the deepest level I can, what I feel (maybe I’m being dramatic) is death, although I dont know what death feels like I assume its like getting old, or being on your death bed, my depression is like waiting to die, everyday not getting up to do anything, never being happy, not having anyone worry or miss you, that’s what death is overall. I seem normal on the outside, besides my arms (yes I mean that) but that’s only because if I cant even handle the beat down from myself, I dont know what’d I do if I had to endure hate from the outside world, that’s one of the scariest things in my opinion. Truly, if I could, I would cut all my hair off and fix it to my liking, I would tear my face off and stab it until I couldn’t anymore, and pay for a new one, I would melt my body until it could be transformed into something I could bare to look at, I would smush my brain until it could feel all emotions, in a normal way, until it could cure my mental illness(s), but I can’t do that, can I. It’s pretty disappointing that not even death wants to be friends with me, how do I know, from the multiple times I’ve tried to meet them, they declined. Another thing I hate, is that I can’t be grateful for the things I have, I have a normal life don’t get me wrong, I have a nice house and good amount of money, but what’s so selfish and unfortunate is that I don’t want it, I don’t want this life, say, maybe one day I do get out of this comfort of sadness, happiness makes me uncomfortable, if I do get out of this one day, I’m still going to hate what I have, I hate what I have and what I don’t, that’s why its better off to end it all. One more thing I hope for in the future… I want to be able to be alone by myself, and to love the people who love me. And most importantly, I want to learn how to not hate myself.",These_Tomorrow8510,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3us79/i_just_need_someone_to_acknowledge_that_im_real/

"There's something other than depression I have, but I don't know what. ","On top of my suicidal urges. I have this weird desire to hurt others, nobody in particular. I feel I might not do it, but I can't deny the thought crosssmes my mind when I'm with someone. I am frankly disgusted by myself for wanting to kill others. 

Whenever I'm alone I have had vivid though brief fantasies, they feel so real and I have this rush of adrenaline from it, so much infact that I start shaking and I can feel my heart beat out of my chest.

 It's like an intrusive thought. I know very well that I most likely don't have the capacity for this kind of violence but the thought alone is still admittedly horrific. There dosen't seem to be any restrictions on who I think on, it's not decided by hate or by connection, it just happens. I don't believe I would hurt let alone kill another human being, but I can't say that these graphic and violent thoughts don't entice me.

I got a foreign language certificate sufficient to volunteer in Germany for 1 year 3 months ago. Currently I am doing nothing, wait for my profile got accepted and living with my mother. I felt useless because I did nothing. My mother told me to learn sth cuz she knew im useless, but i dont know what to learn. Recently, she has enough since the wait is too long and cant stand watching me doing nothing, she dont let me go to Germany anymore cuz she believe that it will end up like the last time. We quarreled and i got so angry and she swear that she will never talk to me again. I feel like shit and really want to end it here. And how easy is it to end it with charcoal, i live in SEA.

I feel so tired ,"If I wrote everything that happened to me, people would say, “Wow, you’re a fighter” or “Try to find happiness.” The thing is, I kinda stopped having feelings when my mom passed away from an aneurysm. It happened out of nowhere. She was my best friend, and I was only 13 when it happened. I lost my person that day, and as months passed, I noticed my brother seemed sad but was and still is distant from my dad. My brother revealed to me that my dad was having an affair. He knew this before my mom passed away but decided not to tell her because he didn’t want to make her feel sad or lonely. I understood that, but my world fell apart when he told me about this. I knew why my dad didn’t always come back from work, why I felt the urge to go to my mom’s bedroom and just hug her until I fell asleep.

My brother and I confronted my dad, and he admitted it. He also told us he had a kid with this woman. That phrase took everything from me. I met this woman and even lived with her for a few years. She is the worst: so mean, yelling at me for no reason. I always cried because my dad knew this but never did anything about it. My brother started a new life; he got married and had a kid. My relationship with my brother is 1/10 because of this, so in a way, I lost my brother too. That woman and her son moved to another country, and now they live there. But a few weeks ago, I heard my dad calling them and using all these cute names for his son. It made me realize something: he was never like that with me. It made me feel like I’m not enough, like I’m not enough as a daughter to him. So I decided that maybe the best I can do is just live in peace with that. But still, I wish I had a father who didn’t decide to break his family.

I didn’t live with my father for a few months. I met a “nice guy,” but I regret it with all my heart. He was my first, and he got me pregnant. I got an abortion. To this day, I have flashbacks of everything: the way he treated me, when I told him he got me pregnant and gave me an STI. All of this made me realize that since I lost my mom, I was looking for love in the wrong places. Sometimes I feel like this world is not for me. Not once do I feel happy. When I wake up, I feel like I’m not real. I feel numb. What is the purpose of me if I’m just going to feel this hurt? I don’t trust anyone. I don’t say anything to my friends. They think I’m okay, but I’m so tired of pretending. Nobody knows that the nights for me are the worst because I remember everything and I cry until I fall asleep. I feel used, and I don’t wish that on anyone.

There are signs that I’m depressed: my hair is thin, and I had the most beautiful curly hair, but now it’s so thin. I don’t go out. I decided to study online this year, so I’m always in my room. I don’t talk to anyone, not even my family, if I ever had a family. Sometimes I think that there are other worlds out there, and maybe in one of them, I’m happy. I’m happy with my mom, and I got to learn how to wear makeup, how to dress nicely, how to recognize good boys from the bad ones. I know this is just a group of people telling their feelings, and maybe I’m overreacting, but please be a good person. I would like to know that good people exist, and I hope one day I stop having this feeling of regret, of not being enough, of feeling used, of feeling that someone touched me and hurt me, and deciding that maybe it’s better if I just end this once and for all. Before all this, I was such a happy girl. I don’t remember her anymore.",peruvian_girl6,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2zjau/i_feel_so_tired/

I have literally no one in my life and I can't take it anymore,"I'm 27M and I can't really see the point in this anymore. I can't remember the last time I was happy and I always said I'll kill myself when I turn 30, but honestly I reached a point where I'll be surprised if I make it to next year. 

No one really knows the real me. I have no one to talk to, the few friends that I have left think depression is a scam and make jokes whenever the subject comes up. This didn't use to bother me but over the last few years I got close enought to open up to 2 girls. Both ended up ghosting me after about a year each. I probably would have killed myself after the first one if the second one (who I was already friends with, just not close friends) wouldn't have noticed that something is wrong with me. I finally had someone who I could be me with, and now that I lost that I don't know how to go back. It didn't used to bother me before but I was 14, the struggles were easier to handle and I didn't constantly feel that it's too late. 

Just once in this entire fucking life I wish I was enough for someone. Just once I wish someone found me attractive or interesting enough to pursue a connection with me. People usually try the ""oh but you actually are enough"", ""you do matter"", ""you'll find the right person"" bullshit but after 27 fucking years of life constantly showing me that's not true, I cannot for the life of me imagine how things would ever change. Everytime I change and make an effort it just kicks me back down from higher up. Even if by a miracle someone is attracted to me, how could I keep them close having 0 experience in dating and this huge baggage of issues. You will probably say I need to work on those issues and once they are all gone someone understanding will fall out of the sky and we'll live happily ever after. How can you fix a non existing self esteem when time and time again you gathered enough confidence to try again only for it to be destroyed in pieces smaller than before. How can I think ""Nah I can do this"" when time and time again I was shown I cannot. 

It's been 6 months since the real me was left completely alone and I honestly don't know how much longer I can reign it in and stay alive. 

That's it, just needed to rant. Don't expect anyone to read all this.

How do I stop the constant negative thoughts.,"Im 26(m). Ive always had moments when ive been depressed but ever since my 26th birthday i have pretty much been cry everyday in my car after work.

The thing is my life isnt as bad as others. I have a job, earns enough money to live month to month, have some friends i talk to here and there and have parents who love me.

However i cant stop the negative thoughts everyday and my head has been hurting, even in moments i should be happy i start thinking negatively. 

My main negative thought is that im scared to be alone / single forever, ive been single all my life but now its scary, i take care of my body and health, the only one issue is im short (5ft4) and never get anyone notice me romantically.
Also ive been feeling very numb, dont feel many emotions plus i feel like i dont enjoy my job but also dont know what to change to and cant risk  getting pay cut. I dont have anyone to talk to so i feel like all my bottled emotions have been coming out this year through crying etc.

I just dont know what to do with my life or my crying, i feel so empty.

Suicide prevention?,"After the loss of a family member,  there was a lot of concern about my mental health and my risk for suicide, since I've had suicidal ideologies after leaving the military.

Prior, I spent a better part of a decade to get better and found solace in family, I've never been happier or as content with life less than a month ago.

When that all came crashing down, they tried to hide my guns and asked if I needed to go somewhere for awhile to sort myself out but I couldn't leave what was left of my family to grieve without me.

The guilt and regrets are eating me alive, I lost over 15lbs in 3 weeks, I hardly sleep anymore, the drugs make me have lucid dreams, so I quit them for my sanity, but I also want to dream of her in a better place.

Whatever 'faith' I had is gone, I realize that there isn't any Supreme being or heaven or a metaphysical place we all go to when we die.

I welcome this self destruction of myself, I deserve it, I failed, my life is meaningless in the grand scheme of things, I'm not going to cure cancer, I'm not going to be the  president of the United States, I'm just 1 of several billions and my mark on this world will be inconsequential. 

I did have one thing, one of the best things to ever happen to me is now gone and I can't think of how things can get better, because I had it all everything I ever dreamed of came true, I was happy and content and that's all gone now and there's nothing to gain or achieve anymore. My ambition was set and completed and I don't know if I can start over as there is nothing left to accomplish in my life. Nothing.

They took away my guns temporarily because of my past history but I have them back while my hostility and hatred has returned from the dead I fear my self destruction is imminent and nothing can stop me now. I'm not control anymore, God help those who try me because I don't care about the repercussions of my actions and I can easily justify it in my fucked up head.

I made a mistake I can't get over,"Warning: Language (IDK if this is worthy of a warning or not), small mention of sex

(Note: I never meant to be a jerk to anyone. A lot of people don't see me as a jerk, and I've tried to change my actions to be kinder and better. I never tried to do any of this to impress anyone. I did it because I was naive and being a dumbass)

I'm sorry for venting I just have nobody to vent to. I've just been holding this in too long.

I've made some really dick moves and I feel like a terrible person. I've hurt people I didn't mean to hurt (I never meant to hurt anyone emotionally or physically, but I guess I didn't realize I hurt them emotionally), and I feel terrible thinking that I might have caused them to do something to themselves they might deeply regret, and I might've started some downward spiral and I feel super guilty.

When I was in 7th grade (a few years ago), I didn't know I was aroace (aromantic and asexual, lacking romantic or sexual attraction) so I felt confused and hormones were weird and shit so I got obsessed with other people's relationships because I was basically suppressing the fact that I hadn't really ever liked anyone. There was this one girl my friend and I talked to like every day in PE and I didn't think I was being a dick. Looking back, I know I was. I'm 80% sure she liked me but I didn't understand people actually lied about not liking someone. She said she hated me and I quite literally told her how much I didn't like her. She was probably lying. I was not. I was being a fucking piece of shit to her and I didn't realize it. She thought I liked her, and she thought I was lying about what I was saying.

There was another incident where she thought I liked her but it was because there was multiple threats written in the bathroom at our school and my friend and I were almost certain her and her bf did it (note: we had nothing against them. She was sweet and kind and thhe bf was a chill guy. We just had pretty good evidence and we went up to the principal, ect) so we were happy when they broke up because we thought one of them would confess. She was crying. I didn't know how much breakups were supposed to hurt. (Note: nothing bad happened at our school, just the threats. Nobody knows who wrote them.)

This one I feel the worst about. She and her bf broke up and she was bawling her eyes out for like 2 days. I wanted to show the ex-bf how much he was hurting her, so I wrote a letter to him ""from"" her. Not the best move but I was confused and naive at the time. I ended up switching the to and from names and it got given to her. I've never been so guilty and never seen someone so sad. I tried to apologize and make up, and she let me. She told me ""we're square"" and we never talked again after I did what she asked me to so we could be even.

I feel like such a dick and I never meant to hurt her but here I am. I would quite literally do anything, even sexual (again, I'm asexual. I've literally had nightmares about sex).

My mind wants me to go,"I don’t really know how to write this. 
I’ve always had suicide thoughts and almost succeded a few times. But i’m getting older and i really feel like the thoughts are getting worse with age. 
I’m going through trauma therapy right now due to years of SA. And after i’m finnished i’m going to be checked for BPD. 
But it’s bad. Last few months i’ve been in and out of hospitals trying to end it, and i’m starting to feel more and more like i’m not really meant to stay around. My mind is tired, my body is exhausted but most of all, my soul isn’t really even trying anymore. 
I don’t know how i’m supposed to move on? I don’t know why i have the feelings i do, why things hurt so bad, why everything is so overwhelming, why i can’t have anyone in my life without breaking. I’m just not meant to be loved. I’m not meant to be apart of whatever this life is suposed to be. I’m so damn tired, mostly of myself. My thoughts. My body, the scars that were made by men. 

I am just not meant to be around, and i’m genuinly planning on ending it. there will be 0% chance of survival this time. I just need to hold out for a few more weeks, so i don’t ruin a wedding coming up. But i’ve planned it all out.

The fear of Eternal Recurrence,"In 1882, Fredrich Nietzche wrote about the thing he called ""the heaviest burden"", or what we also know as eternal recurrence. More than simply reincarnation, it's the idea that our lives will be repeated in an endless cycle and nothing will be different.

""This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence.""

The point of what he wrote was not to speculate about what comes after death, but to invite us to think about how would we react to such knowledge. Would we reject it? Or embrace it?

Sometimes I think the only thing keeping me here is the fear that what he wrote was true.

Constantly depressed and paranoid,"I live in my apartment alone this summer because I am doing research for my university. I go into work for around 6 hours a day and relax when I get home. There are few people in the apartment this summer, but sometimes, I hear footsteps outside my door, and when I do, my heart races so damn fast. The funny thing is I have absolutely ZERO fear about the person trying to break in or kill me, but it is more the fear that they are going to see me by myself wasting away by myself. It is the worst when I am high by myself and I see myself as less than I am. Idk if this is caused by childhood trauma or poor self image, but my brain literally goes into fight or flight mode. I feel a panic attack coming on and then when the footsteps leave, I feel so relaxed right after as if my life had been spared. Can anyone related?

Realization that you just can't do your job anymore?,"*(Not a regularly used account)*

I've been working in my field for 8ish years since I got out of the military. I've never really enjoyed it, but it pays bills.

Over the course of the past year, I've progressively gotten worse and worse with how I feel about my work that I'm supposed to be working right now, and I just stare at my computer in despair. The more I've done my type of work, the more I find it to be the exact type of work that makes the entire state of life in America worse (I've largely worked in finance).

When I was in the military, things at least felt like they had a purpose. Even if that purpose was just to support your brothers and sisters to your left and right. Now, when I think of needing to work in my field for 25 or 30 more years before being able to retire, I think that I would rather just be dead. I'm not going to harm myself. At least I don't think so. It's just that the thought of doing this for even another 10 years make me just feel like not even taking care of my self at all. I have plenty of life insurance. If I'm already going to not be around my family because I'm working all the time, might as well not do anything that will prolong my own suffering.

I don't know that I'll respond to this post in the future, but I needed somewhere to say how I felt if only to get my thoughts in order before I tell someone IRL like a therapist or counselor.",RelationshipRare4209,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4xfhl/realization_that_you_just_cant_do_your_job_anymore/

what is wrong with me? [rant],"I haven't really told or opened up like this to anyone but after seeing people open up on here and the support, I thought I could try as well. 

I'm \[19F\] currently starting my second sem of uni and honestly...its not going how I planned at all. I failed three courses, am eating horribly and generally not feeling like myself anymore to the point where I don't even want to eat, drink or do anything cuz it makes me sick to my stomach at the fact that I...am alive? idk how to describe it. My moods constantly change so fast it's like getting whiplash, I can't face my peers without being revolted in myself and honestly...im so tired of feeling like this. My family are disappointed in my behaviour and my friends try to help but it's just them being like 'don't take it too seriously' or 'oh no, you're fine'. I can't listen to music or find any entertainment anymore cuz this stress is just eating at my brain like a damn parasite and I absolutely hate it.

I tried searching up these things online everything says I might have depression or anxiety but I guess in my mind I don't want to accept that cuz if I do the reality of it all sinks in. In my culture it's kinda taboo talking about mental health and stuff so my family tries to help but it's mostly just 'people have it worse than you', 'stop being dramatic', and the classic 'it's your phone that's the problem'. Part of me knows they are right but it doesn't really help. Im still 19 and can't secure a job, not very open and social and now I have to worry about some immigration issues or else my whole family could risk getting deported. 

Basically, my dad has been trying to secure a stable resident status abroad for almost a decade now and failed. And since we are considered immigrants here, we've been living as international people the whole time- despite living here for 10 years by 2025. It's honestly drained our whole family to the point where we haven't even gone out to a restaurant to eat or enjoyed life for so long. My parents fight constantly and I have to put everything aside to mediate them and be the therapist for everyone since I was 10. But now that I'm considered an adult and have finished primary and high school here, I have a chance at changing it all and gaining residency for my family. 

Naturally, I'm ecstatic that I can finally do something about this situation but with everything else, I'm so scared that I'll screw this up too. My dad says I should take a gap year and secure this, since the process might take about three years but I'm already enrolled and have started 2nd year of uni. I've been trying to find the course I need to do while juggling uni but the intakes available are only in Jan 2025 and it makes me even more hopeless cuz by then I'll already be 20, while my friends are all way ahead of me and thriving. I honestly just feel stuck in my life and even after I tried to stay positive and not take things too seriously, it still weighs me down so much mentally and emotionally.

consuming stories makes me want to unalive myself,"I'm getting more and more confused as to how people can get out of watching any kind of light-hearted series and not be consumed by this giant void of shame, emptiness and nostalgia for something you never had.

I was just alone all the time. too anxious for sports or anything p.e. related. I've never walked to any friends house, never got invited to any party. I live in this boring prison of a house in this boring neighborhood. I live in Brazil thus the schools aren't nearly as interesting as the stuff I see in North America or any other more developed part of the world, and the streets just aren't safe or spacious and green. literally makes me wish I lived in a cul-de-sac. the few friends I ""have"" have much more interesting lives and other things to pay attention to, so we hang out like once or twice a year. I'm just to tired of my life being inside a screen.

when I read these stories of people going through things *together*, or having difficult lives but a couple of friends or siblings to talk to or to casually hang out with, I just get so emotionally involved with them, their lives seem so normal, it's comforting and depressing at the same time, because it's just fiction, it's not really there, they're not my friends, I can't interact with them. and when I finish the story after growing so attached to the characters I just have this moment that I want to cry on the pillow for like half an hour. sorry if this is too uncomfortable to know but I feel so much like shit that I literally don't feel like doing that private thing teens usually do. I literally can't do something so normal because I'm feeling too shit. and then thoughts of self harm flow through my head. it's been like this for years and idk I just think that this shouldn't be normal for a teenager, I don't deserve this, I really don't think I do.",vitu9087,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e39rnd/consuming_stories_makes_me_want_to_unalive_myself/

Seems like my end is near ,"The last couple years have been really difficult. I have lost a lot. A couple of the main things are my mom and my home. I am currently in a homeless shelter for the last year and now they are pushing me out the door. The other week when they gave me a date, July 26th, I flipped out. 

I have a job but not enough income to afford to pay for an apartment. I have had epilepsy my entire life so it's has been difficult keeping a job and getting along with people. I made a decision about 20 years ago that if my mom passed away first and I ended up on the streets I wouldn't go on living. I mean there is no point. Before the Covid started I lost my job because of my seizures, my cat passed away, my friend passed away, had to sell my car, my mom passed away and now am homeless. There is more but that's the main things. There has been so much in my life that I have thought about suicide before. That cat I mentioned was a stray cat that I started to care for and I never really liked cats. She helped me through so many hard times in my life. I believe she was sent by God to help me through the bad days. It's just like everything worth living for is gone.

I really don't know exactly what I will do if they kick me out but I am sure it won't be good. I will be back to where I was a little over a year ago or be seeing my mom in Paradise. ",Mission_Star5888,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e41zii/seems_like_my_end_is_near/

i had a close (kinda) experience with suicide today,"
i live on a closed and private urbanization of condos, and around 6:40 pm the group chat of the urbanization went crazy. people were asking to help someone and for someone to please call ambulance. that’s when i we (my parents and i) started hearing someone screaming outside.

this was a woman, she was crying hard. she was screaming: “please don’t let this be true”, “somebody please tell me that is a nightmare”, “please tell me that my daughter is well”. all the neighbors were around her trying to help. people called the police and the ambulance, she kept crying and screaming. 

after a few minutes a white car appeared and entered really fast until it came close to the woman screaming. it stopped abruptly and people got out of it. it was family of the girl and her mom.

people approached to the house. 

when the police came, they entered. i was talking to a neighbor who had more context of what was going on. it seems the girl already had some mental health problems. he told me that her mom entered the house but didn’t found her anywhere -the sad thing is, she’s a 27 year old that has a baby of 12 to 18 months i would say- she found the baby on the bed undressed (he’s okay) and the bathroom door locked. she started knocking on it but no answer. that’s when she realized what was going on and started to cry for help.

around that time the neighbor was telling me that, another of the neighbors happened to be a nurse, so when the police came, the nurse, a cop and a familiar of the girl went into the house. one of them went down and told us to please keep calling the ambulance; the girl seemed to don’t have any pulse.

they returned upstairs and a few minutes later the ambulance arrived. they came downstairs and statutes saying that she needed reanimation. minutes after, she regained pulse.

it seems she took pills, we don’t know how much and since how long.

they took her out of the house the ambulance runed away with her. that was at around 7:40 pm. we haven’t heard anything yet. (it’s 10:47 pm we i am)


this is the first time i experience this kind of situation and my head is spinning. hearing the mom screaming, watching her family rushing in, the police, the ambulance coming in and taking her out… but what striked me the most was watching her baby in the arms of her husband and thinking: how could you do that to him? (i don’t mean to judge) i felt so sad for that little boy… as i said she appeared to be alive when they took her away, i hope she is. i hope all the family is okay. i don’t know what she was going through but i hope she recovers and get to see her son and her husband.

if you are having thoughts or if you are in a bad place please seek help, please talk to somebody. there is people out there that loves you, even if you feel that there isn’t i can guarantee you that somewhere out there there is somebody that loves you. things will get worse before they start to get better, so please keep fighting, you’re gonna make it , you’re gonna pull through it, you’re gonna be okay, everything is gonna be okay.

I tried talking to friends but none of them were of any help. They just hang up on me and say that they’ll call later but never do.

I'm a mother and a wife and can't do this anymore,"I'm 33. I've been married almost 10 years to an incredible man. My children are 6 and 4. But I've been suicidal since I was 12. I've lived with deep depression ever since. Twenty long grueling years of pain and struggle and mental breakdowns and tears. Living has been AGONIZING. It takes everything inside me to get up every day and take care of my house and husband and kids and a full time job and family and friends and pets. I can't mask it anymore. I can't pretend everything is ok. I've dealt with relationship trauma, family trauma and drama, financial ups and downs, medical issues upon medical issues, and truthfully just terrible luck. Every corner I turn there's a challenge and a struggle. Simple things are never simple.

I'm done. I surrender. I quit. I feel like I'm being held hostage to stay alive. How can someone else tell me that I should keep living or not? Should that be up to the person actually having to live that life?

I have so many people that are clueless to how I feel on a daily basis. I've been able to put on a front for so long. But if I'm not allowed to end my life, then I will slowly kill myself. I started smoking again. Getting very high once everyone is asleep. I'm done taking care of myself. 

It would be easier on everyone, especially my husband and kids, if I could just slip out the metaphorical back door and everyone could be at peace. They wouldn't have me to deal with and infect their life anymore. And I wouldn't have to be in pain. But I can't. I'm stuck here and it's bullshit. 

I recorded messages for people closest to me. I thought that would wake me up and make me keep going but it just felt like another check mark forward on this journey to end my life. I've been getting rid of my things slowly so that it's a minimal burden on those if and when I go.

23M Am I screwed if I didn't have close childhood friendships and missed out on some youthful things?,"I'm 23M. Long story short, I had a best friend when I was in early childhood and honestly that was the best part of my life. But then he moved away and although I had some friends after, none really ever came close to him. I just felt so loved and special around him, but he moved away so soon.

I experienced some neglect too. There were times in my life where the only peers my age I got to see were like once a week on Sundays for 3 hours at most. It really sucked. Apparently I hung out with my neighbors multiple days a week for years for most of elementary according to my mom, but I don't remember. I trust my mom but maybe she doesn't remember? Idk. I'm worried I only saw them once a week at most. Is that normal? I guess she probably remembers just fine.

I wish I could've gone to sports. I wish I could've seen other kids my age every day like the public schoolers got to do. I wish we had more money to do fun stuff with my friends. I wish I got to have a big birthday party with my best friend and a bunch of other people. I wish I could've gone to prom. I wish I could've had a sleepover (with close friends that actually liked me). I wish I could've seen my friends every day in summer and did summer stuff, even if it was just one friend.

I was such a lonely child. This probably sounds pathetic but in middle school I used to pretend I had a little brother and he'd sit with me in the car and talk and we'd cuddle.

Why do I always have to be alone? Why do the people closest to me always have to go? I don't mind having responsibilities or do adult things but all my friends wanna get married, but I'm not ready to move to that stage of life.

I just want to be as close to someone like a little brother like I could've been in childhood.

I don't hate my life. I love my life. I never asked for a perfect life I just asked for someone special to be with.

Is it too late for me? Can I still have a close best friend that I can see every day? I just want a best friend like I used to have, and have them be in my life for longer than a short period of time. I just want to feel that close to someone again. It'd even be nice to have a close group of friends. I never asked for a perfect life, just one where I had someone special.

I'm scared that even if I did get a best friend, that it just wouldn't be the same as it would've been back then. That they'll act too ""old"" and ""mature"", and that there won't be as much fun stuff to do because no one really cares about young adults as much.

Does anyone else get this feeling,"When I have been turned down by my wife after multiple attempts at intimacy I feel an overwhelming suffocating feeling that if my wife doesn't even love and desire me then who else could possibly ever feel like that towards me.

The feeling is like a tense constricting in my neck that just needs a noose to resolve once and for all. This is usually accompanied by a feeling of worthlessness and emptiness.

This leads to an almost insomniatic dwelling on this fact for a matter of hours before I can eventually doze off and get my mental reset (generally achieved with sleeping pills that take a while to kick in if not taken well before the depressive state).",22367rh,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3lbjv/does_anyone_else_get_this_feeling/

"I have no friends to ask for advice, vent to, laugh with, share hobbies with because I am just a shitty person.","I am 34f

I have not been able to hold onto a single friendship in so long. I really think that people just tolerate me at best.

I see people have extremely close friendships with people who share the same interests, have children around the same age, having a good time together, all that lovely stuff. But for the life of me I cannot hold onto a friendship.

Just to show a little self awareness of my flaws, I feel like I am never consistent as a person and can having changing opinions everyday(like how I feel about a coworker, controversial issues, my approaches to situations) I am very aware that I am all over the place. But I don't have bad intentions. I do my best to consider what would hurt others and what should or should not do/say. Sometimes my honesty is not appreciated, totally understandable. But does that make me so undesirable to be around?

Just as an extended example, I became friends through my work, since I work remote but even they avoid contact with me or keep it at a minimum.

I know that I got upset at each of these friends at one point because they have said something hurtful to me when I just try to barely exist around them. Also, if I have a moment of success I feel like they take it as a threat and make snide comments about how they are struggling with a task they have work as a response. They have had their successes too and I tell them good job let them know that they deserved the praise they get. They complain about their teams and I would listen to them and try to console them or try to give advice but they would ignore me or just would be dismissive in general. 

I even at one point was telling one of those friends that I really missed one of our old coworkers and was getting emotional about it and they said that I shouldn't care since this person didn't give a shit about me... later this person denied ever saying something like this when I brought it up months later.

I won't deny that recently I started saying snide stuff back because I have kinda had enough and just returned the attitude. But now that made it even worse between us.

I don't know what to do anymore but I know I complain about person A with person B and then person B will slowly just not want to talk to me anymore either. Like I have no one to confide it at all. I feel like if someone says/does something I am not allowed to talk about it cause then I am just the ball of negativity and no one wants to be around me. What do I do? I feel like there isn't a single soul out there that gives a shit about me.

Is it me? Like am I just a piece of shit? Am I just so fucking unlikeable?

Edit: To add about the hobbies, I hate competitiveness to my core. It makes me anxious and I don't like feeling that. But whenever I want to share a hobby why do I feel like people want to compete with that hobby? Kinda like my cooking is better than yours, playing games (in a team) but competing to show who is better in skill. I just want to have fun. I don't want to talk about whose is better. Maybe I am just sensitive. But I just want to share a hobby with someone that won't treat it as a competition",Positive-Ambition970,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1vqje/i_have_no_friends_to_ask_for_advice_vent_to_laugh/
30 Years old and I failed,"Hi Everyone, 

I’m just using this as a way to vent my thoughts on what I’ve been feeling. I don’t have family or friends. Just me. 

I’ve been stressed out lately on where I am in life. I don’t have a job, I’ve applied over 800 jobs in finance and I can’t land one. I have 8 years of experience and I can’t seem to get through the final stages. Bills are piling on and I can’t catch a break. 

4 years ago it wasn’t like this, I was with a long term relationship and a house and a great job and was making $300K a year in banking. 

Then 2 years ago, my mom passed away. Lead me down a a very depressed path. I found my comfort in alcohol and gambling to numb the pain. Emptied my bank accounts and just gave it away to random philanthropy places because I wanted to end my life. 

I ignored and pushed away the love of my life, my friends, and I don’t have my only family I had which was my mom. 

I live in an apartment that’s past due by 30 days, and I have no electricity, and I can’t even land a job.

It is still possible to X while owning the pet. I can leave the pet with a sitter for a week, tell family I’m on vacation with the hopes of being left alone/not found, and then attempt again. I hate being found.

Why do I wake up every single morning with suicidal ideations? They used to last me almost most of the day and not go away no matter what I tried to do.

no one would care if I was 6 feet under,"I dont think I remember the last time someone genuinely returned the efforts or even seemed to enjoy having me in their lives. every relatives too busy doing their own thing so like we only meet up once every blue moon unless its the usual but even they tend to seem less interested in me as a person. I have had so many failed ""friendships"" that I just end up not caring for people anymore. In fact I would not care if society or this earth didnt exist, its a hellhole trying to find somewhere to belong and trying to do well at something.

I also cant count the amount fo general bullshit I have had to deal with over this life. yet people seem forgetful or clueless when it clmes to their own behaviour often telling me its just a joke or outright invalidating everything I say or feel thus making me withdraw from others. I try to care about the latest thinfs but I dont feel overly attached to nothing, people mostly seem to have a statement to say to me then thats all there is to the conversation, nothing more nothing less just nothing for me to go on because theyre not putting their share of effort into it.

For example I have one ""friend"" whos clearly the type that has 100s of other friends online but she has such little effort with me that I often wonder why I bother with her in the first place. She only seems to message me when say theres an online quiz or some other shit otherwise again she doesnt seem to notice that I go months without hearing from nobody. Sometimes I question if I am even real because I cant find no place to fit in no matter what I try theres people who try to get me into unfair situations or unhelpful situations theres been endless counts fo gossiping but no one else but myself has noticed it so no one else has even tried to prevent it, people just make snarky comments judgemental looks at me even for merely trying to exist in a social setting. For example I was in an outdoor store and there were two old hags in there at the same time as myself and my mum, and they were outright sideeying me and whispering just loud enough for me to hear it and they inly stopped when I stared back.

I feel like its got worse with social media because I try not to feel so bored, lonely and done with this whole ""life"" thing but when I aint got no one else to hang out with cause people have turned me down in the past even if I made the suggestions yet they would happily do things with other people and post about it online. it basically rubs in my face that they really never did care or simply they do not need me in their life. Or that their life is some how more interesting than mine. Thus leading to me feeling fomo for not being able to get anywhere and society always says its never too late but it does get to a point where everyone else my age has something going for them and people judge anyone my age for not being at the same point as everyone else.

In lockdown I tried reaching out to former classmates but only got one response and I expected him to reply but havent heard nothing since and it feels weird to message someone who got their life and he got his own family together yaknow? what do I do? theres literally nowhere else I can find my ""people"" and it sucks when O have to witness younger people being able to do more or have their own group and then they can share it online for anyone else to oggle at.

I dont mean nothing special to nobody. its fact at this point. if you arent rich no one cares, if you arent popular no one cares, if u quiet no one going to give u enough chance to socialise because everyone so mf loud and attention seeking, if you arent rich then also no one cares for you.

People just dont want long meaningful connections outside of the people they have around them, I might as well be a mf ghost as well cause people fucking act like im not part of anyones lives as it is.

The friend that message me about the quiz didnt even ask nothing not a hello, how are you? not a what are your latest interests? I thought it was bad in school but with social media and smartphones it feels sp alienating? everyone else so busy with their lives and showcasing it online they aint caring about those they leave behind. Even people that are on rhe street get more attention than myself they wouldnt dare ask me what I been doing and I cant think of nothing to say because in social situations those loud enough get most the attention and hog all the conversations so even if someone ask me I get maybe 5 seconds and one sentence out of it.

You have to actually force yourself to find something worthwhile to care about be it sports or some other stupid celebrities or movie series because it seems thats the only way people would ever have anything in common enough tonwant to converse with you. otherwise they dont care how you feel, they dont care what you doing if it not anything relevant to themselves. I dont want gifts I want deep meaningful connections that last in the long run where we check up on one another but even with social fucking media people dont put that saame effort badk make me wonder why I shouldnt just put myself 6 feet under

Eeven the arupid retarded part time job I couldnt make that last and if I did anything to try to socialise people either didnt care for what I say, the younger folk already had their own group and the manager would pretend to be nice but then snitch about me to her mamager and thus it seemed like I cant get nothing out of it anymore.

I could tell she was feeling down. She has lost a lot of weight since I saw her. I noticed she developed an ED and tried my best to make her eat more. 
Yesterday I went on Snapchat and saw her story she made about her healing journey from depression.
Turns out, she's been extremely depressed and self harming. According to her this is not the first attempt but the 32nd.
As I was scrolling through I felt like a failure for not recognising the obvious signs. And at the end of her story she said she relapsed again and goodbye for the last time.
She sent me s snap of her arm attached to an IV (I saw this before her Snapchat story) I called her several times she didn't pick up.
She just replied to me that she's hospitalised for attempt and that she'll call me later.

I have no idea what to say to her to help her. We are separated by cities and I don't think her parents know about it. I'm scared to tell them because it will feel like I'm breaking her trust and sharing something she doesn't want to share.

it's harrowing to have to breathe to survive, to keep my blood pumping through my body, through the tips of my fingers.

i can't handle being this person anymore.

to live the life of a human being anymore.

no one, floating aimlessly through life without purpose or reason.

i'll extend my hand, but no one will take it,

to intertwine their fingers with mine, 

to tell me it'll all be okay again.

no one will bother to help me, no one no one no one.

am i really such a burden?

why must i be so hard to love, why was i born in the first place? nothing.

oh, what a shame it is to be me. i'll cry out against my existence, but i'll still be here. 

nothing, excruciating.

""I shall be nothing, the wind, the sky.""

the texture, the taste, the smell, no motivation, no incentive to do anything anymore.

as i am writing this, i feel so lightheaded, and it's unbearable to even breathe. 

such a strange feeling, to exist.

oppressing, harrowing, incomprehensible.

i feel my heart beat from the inside of my throat, and i feel sickened when i press my fingers against it, to feel it pulsate beneath.

i look into the mirror, and all that looks back is a person who has lost everything.

i miss having the luxury to enjoy life.

it's too late though. i feel too far gone. 

i can't find a reason to be much longer; no desire or hope to live, nothing but the blankness of death after.

""There's nothing worth pursuing at the cost of prolonging a life of suffering.""

i'm so scared of the pain though, that i'm starting to second-guess myself.

i hope it'll snap my neck. i don't want to have to die a slow and suffocating death.

that's what i fear the most, the pain that'll follow death.

why is it so hard to just die painlessly and instantly? 

what a pathetic life i have made for myself,

what a pathetic excuse of a human being.

i truly am nothing to this world.

 it's unbearable to think anymore, to feel anything at all anymore. 

excruciating, nothing.

i just want to fade out of existence so i won't have to think about anything anymore. 

Thinking Is exhausting, and I just want to rest already.

Why do I feel like this,I am 15 and constantly get suicidal thoughts. I have a good life a decent house. I live in a ok area everything is fine. But I don’t know why I just have this thing in the back of my head that makes me hate life. And I go through random depressive episodes everyday. I got close to killing myself once. But ussually people who are depressed have problems I don’t have a lot other then I am ugly but it doesn’t bother me too much. I have my parents right now so I go to them when I get these weird thoughts but what am I going to do when I grow up? What’s going to stop me from offing myself then? Does anyone have any idea how to help this other than medication because my parents are strongly against that. I’ve tried therapy but all they told me was how to deal with the panic attacks and anxiety. It didn’t help much. But I feel stuck I don’t know what to do and I don’t want this part of me that makes me hate life for my whole life I won’t make it. If I wanna kill myself now then I can’t imagine how much I will want to when I am an adult by myself.

I always lifed the life from someone else,"Hi there, I am not a native speaker so, yes, I really want to write down my story.

I am 26 and last year i divorced my marriage, we where together since I am 17.. so you see a long time. Nothing bad happend, we didn't cheat or something else. I'll guess it's my fault wasting his time. 

I grew up in a village from a good parent household. My parents know his parents and they always said, ohhh our children should be a couple, dream couple ... and and and... for some real we got pushed in this role, but I don't want to play a victim, it was my own decision (I guess) 

I was never really happy in this relationship, he knows, my parents knows, we had nothing similar. I am more that type of human ""spread love and help everyone"" and he was more like ""other humans problems are not my business"" (he's banker, you're problem is only his business when you need money) &lt; his favorite joke 

Ok - so in this RS, Marriage from 2014 to 2023 we seen a lot, we buyed a lot, 2 houses, moved 900 KM away from our home and much more. 

It's like I was sleeping and last year I woke up from a dream and don't want to life this live anymore, it's like a bubble popped and I tried so hard to suppress this unhappiness but... i couldn't. I divorced and he was ok. We don't have a fight or trouble, we are friends now. We don't had children together, just cat &amp; dog. (Our future goal was always, be richer then to others 😓)

Since then I am single and I don't sleep with someone else, because I feel like wtf how should this work with someone else? And I am a wife or I was a wife, I am too good for this hook up culture! 

.... Now I am here, feel completely lost, I don't want my old life back, but I feel like, I can't see the why for living. Why I am here, what todo. Anxiety haunt me everyday. 

From the outside I am strong / independent women. But in the inside I am a children. 

And I don't do drugs, no medicine, alcohol, no smoking... I eat healthy and still feel so depressed. 😔 

I feel like I don't know who I am.. where I am be and and and. All my friends have BC 30+
Wtf I was all this time married and had no time for this, when they where drunk at party's I was at work, nursed my dad and cooked for my husband! (No we are not a religious cult or something like this, we are not religious) 

I really feel lost, I feel like shit but my old life was not good at all too. My old life was a golden cage.

I don't know, I really feel like everyone around me is in a dream bubble and I am the only one who is awake 🥲

And I feel so much guilt and shame, how much time I waste in his life. I mean yes I was always honestly about my unhappiness, but I was never brave enough to go. 

I literally destroyed 2 lives, mine and his. I wish I could suppress my emotions and feelings and life with him until we are old. But over the years it got everything so worse, that I didn't wanted that he touch me anymore. But I was always loyal! I never cheated. 

Omg my head feel so sick 🤢

"Idk why I’m writing this, I guess I wanted to actually share my story for the first time","So, I’ve pretty much decided it’s time. I’ve got my method figured out and supplies ready- won’t disclose because it’s costly and will surely do the job, with the least amount of pain. Last time I attempted the gun misfired, that was a few years ago and I couldn’t bring myself to do it again.

That was what I thought was the lowest point in my life. I’ve wanted to die since I was 7, I was always different from everyone else, and bullied horribly for it. I transitioned into a girl when I was in my mid-teens. Got addicted to meth and heroin, and I just planned on using until I died. Unfortunately that didn’t happen fast enough and after 6 overdoses I guess I thought I couldn’t die. My family member actually was there with me one time and left me there alone in case I died and police showed up. I woke up projectile vomiting.
By the time I had gotten out of addiction I was an adult and my father (RIP) got diagnosed with an incurable degenerative disease and passed a few years later. I was working in the service industry and didn’t think about school.
 
One day I met my stbxh. When I tell you it was like the sky opened up and everything came together believe me, it was magical. I left the service industry for a better career path during covid, and started to actually make good money. Everything was looking good and I was feeling okay for once, but we (stbxh) were off and on every few months. Nothing and nobody compared to him, and I could never forget him, never could be with anyone else. So after a year separated, we got back together. Eventually we got married, I thought he had really changed. 

I ended up leaving my job to be a sahw. Life happened, time passed and one day he sat me down and said he wanted a divorce. The one person I ever truly loved and could see myself with, the most perfect man in the world really just pulled the rug out from under me again. Except this time I lost everything. Our home is his property, I had no job, no health insurance, nothing to fall back on except my mother. She and I share the same bed because all the other rooms are occupied by other family members. All of my stuff is still in boxes because there’s nowhere to put it. 

I really tried hard to pull myself out of it, I got a new job, got accepted into school, saved up for one of my passions, but the truth is that I can’t even think about enjoying any of the rewards of my hard work. I have literally no friends (none, I am completely alone and always have been. Except for one friend who I don’t talk to anymore because even that relationship was codependent), my family is addicted and dysfunctional, my poor cat misses her father and yowls every night, and the love of my life disposed of me once again like nothing. All I’ve ever wanted was to be loved like that, and I had it. Now it’s gone and I think about the life I’m creating now and it’s meaningless. I think about the future and it’s bright and fruitful, but it’s meaningless. I know I won’t ever feel that way for someone else and there’s no job, possession or accomplished dream that can replace it. My options are just too narrowed as a trans person.

So here I am at the even lower lowest point in my life. I’m ready, and I’m gonna make sure I don’t fail this time. I just really needed to tell someone because this has been a secret I’ve kept to myself for decades now so I don’t end up hospitalized. I’ve really thought about my options and this is truly the only feasible solution, I won’t ever be happy like I once was and I will be alone forever. And I’m so envious of people who can thrive like that but I’m not one of those people. I’m tired of being alone. I’m rambling, I’m sorry. I just needed to get this off my chest because no one knows. I know, this whole thing sounds stupid and pathetic. That’s definitely how I feel right now. Stupid, alone, thrown out, codependent and pathetic.

26 year old worthless virgin,"I just can't fucking live with this. Life just keeps reinforcing how fucking worthless i am. I just wanted to have a normal life in high school and college. Make friends, find love, go together to parties, on vacation, have sex.

 But no, i'm just a worthless loser. I spent so much time reaching out to people only to get ignored or dismissed with cheap excuses. Year after year. The only woman who ever gave me some positive attention ended up taking advantage of me and abusing me for months. And she was taunting me non stop about how women can get anyone these days and men should just bend over backwards to appease them. 

That's the only thing i'm good for. She was nice as long as i was simping for her. My friends only talk when they need something. Got taken advantage of many times since then. Got told many times how much of a loser i am since then. My mother told me i'm the type of guy women settle down with when they turn 30 and look for someone ""reliable"": has a job, owns a house, ""talks very little but listens a lot"". That's all i'm useful for. 6 years of self improvement changed absolutely nothing about it. Couldn't even have sex like a normal fucking age. At best i'll be just one of those meek loser ""late bloomers"". Another weakness for people to pick up on and exploit me. 

Nobody ever supports me. Everybody i tried talking to is just annoyed. Get therapy, stop whining, focus on some hobbies. My former ""friend"" also told me to fuck hookers if i have to. I've been doing that for two years ever since i started working full time. It didn't make me happy. Not at all. Just more bitter that my family is satisfied they finally made me shut the fuck up and cope. 

I just don't want to live anymore. I've been suicidal for two years and nothing gets better. My youth is gone. My high school experience is gone. My college experience is gone. I'll never catch up because i'm too busy working and i'm still the same loser i always was. Even if i did, i'll have the joy of getting that teenage experience 10 years late as a bitter and broken adult. What's the point in it now? My abusive friend won. My family won. 6 years later i'm exactly the man they wanted me to be. I just don't give a shit. This life is just worthless. Every night before sleep i think of how much i want this to finally end.

"Rough year, feel like my life is crumbling and I’ve lost myself.","Broke up with my girlfriend of seven years about about 4 months ago. Seven was our special numbers so I was going to propose July. I feel as if I did it because I was depressed and I lost myself and I lost trust because I caught her lying so many times about silly things. Started to feel I lost us and we were arguing a lot and one day I just snapped. I have been regretting it.

Then lost my job, which I had a really great opportunity at, and it was purely due. The reason I was depressed from the break up, and I couldn’t get myself out of bed for a couple weeks. I feel like I’ve just been drinking and being sad and I’ve tried to eat healthy and go outside and be with people and I just felt depressed and sick like I’m not myself anymore.

I’ve always had depression, yet I’ve always dealt with it very well. I moved out of the house early on Was fairly successful. I don’t get the chance to visit my parents very much. I always knew my mom is a wine drinker but these past four years. I’ve slowly seen her basically kill herself with alcohol. This last year was just got really bad and I feel like I’ve already lost her. 

I’m a big mama boy I can’t even have a normal conversation with her anymore, she can’t walk, and she is starting get dementia from drinking so much. This Mother’s Day she called me by the wrong name and was totally out of it. Life has just been moving so fast. I feel like I didn’t even notice it and she was the best supportive mom growing up so I just don’t understand what happened. Recently, she asked me to go get a gun and kill her, and I didn’t I didn’t even know what to say and just left it just broke me. In and out of rehab have costed me and my dad so much and she just doesn’t wanna get better. I feel as if I’m gonna lose her any day now.

And then I had two friends commit suicide one last month, one this month and I had no idea if their struggles. The first you know was rough cause he had four kids so I just basically tried my hardest to help take care of everything for them, but it was a rough process. Then just last week my buddy shot himself and left a note which I was mentioned in. His mother asked me to write a eulogy for his funeral. This is his one of my close friends who I would come to you when I was down, and he was the best at working me through it. I couldn’t find the words, but I eventually did and I wrote it and then when it was time to go up and read it, I couldn’t even speak a word and had to have someone read it for me.

I have a lot of close friends that love me and then I can talk to, but for some reason, I am so embarrassed and have a hard time opening up other people I don’t want to see the weakness. I’ve always been really confident and I’ve just lost myself and I don’t really know who the fuck I am anymore. I’m only 25 years old and I feel like I dealt with my depression great with hobbies and staying busy. But this year has just crushed me and I don’t even know what to say or what to do. I started a new business which is going well and I have a second job so I’m helping out with a lot of family financial problems. Yet I hate myself and I hate my life, I feel I lost myself along time ago and now I just covered up with drugs.

It feels like rockbottom and that’s not even all of it. I’m trying to keep it short. I don’t know why I’ve came to myself so much and I’ve tried therapy, but I just filled so disconnected. I miss my ex-girlfriend and she needs time alone and I feel stupid for letting her go. I’m looking for support and advice because I feel broken and wanna get better but I still just sit here and weep every day.

Overcoming an add*ction,"
I just wanna start on saying im serious on this post, I am actually seeking for help, like therapy tho i dont want to you know? but please give me advice. 

Hi, im Z, i have the thoughts and actions of Inc*st, sorry for the word, but yeah. It all started when I hit puberty, I had this older brother who i put my H*rniness into. I know its so wrong but its so hard to fight the urge. Until now I still do, But just last month, I had just realize its immoral, and such a big sin so i stopped (voyeur), after that, I still had the guts to do actions of Inc*st, I actually had been caught by my older brother, after that we act like nothing happened, we talk the same, we sometimes laugh together, so all goods on that i guess! As of right now, my addiction has been died down (I hope) I just really wanna move on pass by this, I need help. I need advice. Its so immoral i wanna move on. 

I read one Quora answer that its probably just because im young and bc of my hormones, and thats why I put my Older brother in that position, which I guess was true. I had a Mutual Understanding relationship once and I didnt bother to put attention to my Older brother, so i guess its true you know?

I hope you guys wont be harsh on me, Because i am seeking for help and advice on how to move on! I wanna be the best version of myself, to make the LUST go away, I get panic attacks and overall anxiety about it. Need help.",muhdiiiiii,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4z2ot/overcoming_an_addction/

I (21M) have been dealing with suicidal ideation since childhood. How can I be happy?,"I don't think I ever remember being happy as a kid, so I can't really remember when I first started feeling suicidal, but I do remember the first time I told my step dad that I was suicidal when I was maybe 6 or 7. He just marched me into the kitchen, gave me a knife, and told me to do it. Obviously he was trying to prove that I wasn't really suicidal, but I just felt trapped by my own cowardice. I just lived under the thought that I was better off dead, but too useless to ever make that a reality myself. Time really hasn't helped with that at all. After high school, I went to trade school, did pretty well at first, but then fell into drug abuse and depression and wasted away part of the year. I was back home, without skills to put on paper, no job, and that same sense of uselessness. I made a plan that if by the end of that year, I hadn't made some progress with my life, I'd hike up to a cliff and kill myself. Now I'm on track to get my CS degree, but I still feel like I don't deserve to be alive. It feels like the only reason I don't just find a belt and hang myself over my balcony is because I've got a cat that'd probably miss me. I really don't want to live constantly reminding myself not to kill myself just because I have a cat. I know I need therapy, but I can't afford it. I just don't know what to do.",Melodic_Elevator6601,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4pvsf/i_21m_have_been_dealing_with_suicidal_ideation/
Thing I wrote in a moment of clarity last night,"I've been feeling really suicidal and hopeless lately, and yet last night when I was smoking weed I had a weird moment of clarity and gratitude where suddenly all the depression seemed really stupid. So I wrote this up to try to capture the feeling for my future self. This morning it's pretty much gone as I predicted, but writing this and knowing that at one point I believed it gave me hope and I thought it might help others. Sorry if this is the wrong place or counts as ""general uplifting content""; I thought since I have MDD myself it might be okay but I can definitely delete it.

  


Nothing really matters, because in a billion years the sun will go out and we'll be wiped into obscurity. The fact is that there's no real deeper destiny or secret meaning to the human race, and we're truly not a result of anything other than crazy chance. This tiny spinning rock in space just happened to have the perfect distance from a star and balance of elements to create and continuously support life. And we're nothing more than a bunch of clumps of cells that somehow evolved to think and, as a result, understand the utter gravity and hopelessness of this insignificance. Because it is hopeless.

And yet, we live. Nothing matters, and yet we form relationships and create art and get angry when we lose in a video game and feel nice when we're sleeping on soft things. And we create customs in which every person has their own day per year when they are celebrated for simply being alive. And we harness lightning and transport it through rocks we found in the ground just so we can be warm and have light and watch videos of other humans. And we feel enough loyalty to which part of our tiny planet we were born on or which category of other humans we are attracted to that we hang designs of cloth to represent those parts of ourselves. And we understand how little our small pocket of life matters and have moments of sadness, when the gravity of existence and obscurity places its full weight onto our chests. This sadness too, this feeling of lonely unites us. Because our world is small, but we are all living on it. Because there's a whole lot of black out there, and yet right now we are close enough to a star to bathe in its warmth and light. 

And when a billion years from now the sun goes out we will die, and that will mean none of our experiences will have had a single effect on the broader history of the universe. But still they happened, and maybe that's enough to say they mattered, at least to us. We will die but we will die together, in the same blinding flash of life, holding each other on this tiny rock surrounded by darkness and stars.

We're all going to die someday, but today we're alive, and food tastes nice, and music sounds good, and maybe that's enough reason to stay alive at least another day.",unberry,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4cfaz/thing_i_wrote_in_a_moment_of_clarity_last_night/

Like bro, who cares if fun isn't real or anything, it makes people happy so just let them be happy

im fucked up,"ive never really used reddit so yh dont judge me  
Hi, I'm a 13 year old girl, I live with my mom and my dad left me when I was 6, honestly I couldn't care less for him. I can hardly remember him. I have 7 sisters, (4 older, 3 younger) and 3 older brothers. My house is pretty fucked up to be honest. I got my phone smashed because I didn't make my younger sister food even though my mom told her to make it. My mom hasn't bought me a new phone yet, (its been 6 months). My mom also has walked in on me when I'm showering, I know she's my mom and all, but it just makes me uncomfortable to be honest. I remember one time in year/grade 6 (when I was about 11/10 years old), I felt really shitty and I just wanted to end myself, all my friends left me and made rumours about me and I remember I told one of my sisters about it, she told me I was overreacting. Then I hid the note behind the couch I completely forgot about it. My mom found it a few days later, she began screaming at me, she was pissed. I just cried in my room. I've never felt so shitty. I've been losing my friends, being disruptive and getting high. I've had thoughts about killing my mom and family members whenever I felt shitty. I've had thoughts of stabbing myself over and over again. I just want to end it all. I've been self-harm free for 2 months. I really want to finish myself off, I just want to actually fucking die. Please don't say that I have potential or that I shouldn't, I just want to die. I really want to die, I've tried overdosing, hanging etc. I want to be sent away to a mental hospital, please.

The worst part about having slit your wrists as an attempt to kill myself,"I have a giant scar across my forearm and its about 20cm long, i tried slitting my arm as an attempt to kill myself about four months ago (i stopped because i sent my best friend at the time a text where i said goodbye and he said if i didn't stop he would call an ambulance and they would have got me into a phsyquiatric unit) (I think his idea was stupid because next time i attempted I just didn't say anything to him) 

The thing is, I am still not well with my mental health, and sometimes I do think about killing myself. The thing is, before i tried slitting my wrists i didn't like the idea at all since (like eveyone) I thought ""that must hurt"" but i was actually surprised by how little it hurts, well, by how little i cared about how much it hurt and where it reaches a certain point where you learn to ignore it, so the idea of attempting it again is always at the back of my head thinking ""whatever, it doesnt even hurt that much""",Icy-Philosophy6273,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3qo9y/the_worst_part_about_having_slit_your_wrists_as/

"I once tried to end it, but failed so hard that I cheered myself up. ","Idk if this is the right place to share this, but I think it might be the only place. 

This happened around 20+ years ago now,  back when I was in my first or second year of high school. I was getting bullied every single day, had no friends, nobody to talk to about it, and was an absolute ball of emotions.    
Most of the time I was just pure rage, because how the hell could the teachers turn a blind eye, when the bullies weren't even being subtle? So many kids bullied me, that the teachers just made the mathematical decision that it was better to ignore one child, than punish 5+, and ruin their education. 

So one day, I was at my lowest, and decided to end it all. The issue was, I hated the pain of being cut, drowning wouldn't work because I kept coming up for air, and I couldn't tie any knots. 

So I decided to use my own school tie.... This is when it gets funny.

I had one of those closets that's built into the wall, with a shelf and a bar for hanging clothes hangers...so my absolute dumbo brain, decided to put my tie through the bar, hold onto the other end of the tie with both hands.... And lift my legs off the ground.... Like a god damn looney tunes character. 

I only dangled for a few seconds, before I lost my grip and came crashing down with an almighty thud. 

It was at that point, that I realised how unbelievably dumb what I tried to do was. Not because I wanted to live, or because it didn't make sense to punish myself for other people's actions. Only because the way I tried, was so cartoon levels of dumb. So I'm just lay on the ground, my school tie messed up laughing my ass off. 


Sadly when I went downstairs, and tried to casually tell my mom that I had just tried to hang myself, the timing could not of been worse. She was right in the middle of watching a talk show about depressed kids who had tried to kill themselves. So when I told her what I had just done she yelled at me for making it up, saying that the kids on TV had genuine problems, and I was grounded and sent back to my room. 


It wasn't till over a decade later that I told her what I had tried to do, and reminded her of how she had yelled at me. Honestly I think even a decade later from telling her, she still hasn't forgiven herself.

But for me, it's weirdly one of my funniest memories. The time I tried to off myself like a god damn looney tunes character. Like I was gonna pass out, yet somehow keep holding the tie. 

I still have depression, though it's hard to tell some days, due to all the genuinely legitimate reasons we all have to be sad, and not want to get out of bed in the morning (like if my life was great and I felt this way, then it would be obvious it's depression, but even people without depression would agree that life sucks right now) but I never tried to kill myself ever again, thanks to how dumb I felt when I did try.

I keep hurting people everywhere I go ,"I'm too sensitive to it. I make a small joke like putting on those eclipse glasses and looking at my friend and saying ""I can't see you, you must not be very bright"". At the time I thought it was really funny, but I told somebody else that joke today and they didn't laugh. I asked my friend if she had thought it was funny and she said she did now, but that it had hurt her feelings a little in the moment. Learning that made me feel terrible. 

The other day I told my boss he looked weird in his shirt. I meant to say seeing him in a certain casual shirt was weird cause I'm so used to seeing him dressed as a boss. I felt bad and had to track him down later to apologize and he said he had actually thought it was funny and that he felt bad that I felt the need to apologize. Which made me feel worse like I'd made a situation that wasn't awkward into one that was. 

But the big giant thing is I just ended things with someone I really, really care about and deeply love. This man is really just the best. We were friends first. He's kind, he's loyal, he's funny, he's so generous, and I wanted our relationship to work but I just wasn't feeling it for whatever reason. I ended things as quickly as I realized, and he is taking it really hard. He's a beautiful soul and I never would want to hurt him and now I doubt he'll ever want to be my friend again. 

I just feel like I keep hurting peoples feelings, or if I didn't, I think myself into circles until I convince myself that I did. Or sometimes I REALLY hurt people. I killed a fly the other day and cried about it, because what right did I have to take it's life? But other people don't get so affected in this way. It's exhausting, I don't want to hurt anyone. Honestly. It genuinely makes me wish I was never born. I would so much rather be broken up with than be the person doing the breaking up, because at least in that instance I'm not carrying all this guilt. 

I was thinking of ending my life today and what I would write on the note. ""I don't want to hurt anyone anymore."" But how silly would that be? Because by taking my life, I would be hurting people who love me. And I know there are a few who do, I have a pretty good support system. I just am so tired. I'm so tired of being hurt and of hurting and I have been through a lot in my life and I just don't really want to do it anymore, honestly. But there's no out, I just have to go through it all. I don't mean to sound whiney but god I just really don't want to go through it all.  

I am trying to look at my life as something to cherish. I remember my 7th grade teacher used to congratulate us on our birthdays instead of saying happy birthday, and we all thought it was weird, but sometime near the end of the school year, when someone finally questioned her, she told us ""not everyone makes it to 13. Lots of people don't. You've made it this far, so congratulations!"" And I try to remember that. I'm 26 now (I probably sound a lot younger, sorry you had to read all my whining) and I can picture myself living a whole life, but on top of all the hurt and guilt I feel, there's a lot of anxiety about the state of the world and I don't even know what the future can look like. So is this life even something to cherish? Lately I feel like it's all something to fear, or something of a burden, and I am getting tired of carrying it.",frycrunch96,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3n1w9/i_keep_hurting_people_everywhere_i_go/

feelin hella suicidal rn fr,"I can't do it because I know this is just another occasional feeling, but I want to share it, even if no one cares (which is likely the case). When I get a job, it's from that point on that I'm fucked. From that point on, I'm a pawn that society and power structures will use to benefit themselves and profit off of. I don't feel like I have any kind of individual autonomy in this bitch. I am drawn and forced into a collective group practicing groupthink. I am not regarded as an individual, rather an organism that makes up a goddamn collective that I'm forced to submit to, and if I do anything to benefit myself in the motherfucking goddamn slightest, it's selfish and evil. People only care about what social skills I can showcase to them. People I would in the general sense call ""friends"" are really just people who are drawn towards me because of a certain trait I showcased to them that they grew to like. When I stopped showcasing those traits, they no longer had any interest. So they left. People are naturally selfish. And society forces this creed onto me that I don't agree with, and tells me that what I've grown to resonate with is wrong, self-destructive, and evil. They say that because it's not what they seek, which is optimism and a facade that makes everything look like it's fine and nothing could ever possibly go wrong. If you have 'good' social skills, you will be revered among everyone and be looked at as some kind of charm, but if you have 'bad' social skills or are socially inept, you will be seen as some scary punk who all he ever wanted to do was kill people. You just drive people away. You're undesirable, disgusting, worthless, and just an overall useless retard who could off themselves and no one would care, or those ""remembering"" you would do it in a way that still is not understanding.

No longer able to feel happiness ,"I(34F) have come to the realization over the last 6 months or so that I may be ""depressed"", incapable of feeling genuine happiness or excitement. Absolutely nothing triggers any dopamine or any sense of joy. None of the things that I used to look forward to or jump out of bed about gives me the same feeling or any feeling at all anymore.
I've gone through a lot in the last year, and life has a funny sense of humor at my expense it seems. 
For example, I was finally ""excited"" for my birthday this year, and the morning of I woke up at 8am with a migraine so bad..I was in bed until 4 pm canceling the plans my boyfriend made.  Then I went out to meet my best friend once I was well enough (plans he made a week prior), and he never showed, ending a 14 year long friendship.

Another example.. going on a trip I've been looking forward to for months and spent loads on..only to get my period (off schedule) the day we arrive and be in so much pain and unable to do many activities for days .

Meeting friends for a concert we've all been looking forward to..only to have them no show. That's happened twice this year, different friends.

I could go on and on and on with similar examples..

I've lost so many friendships this year because I no longer tolerated the one sidedness of it. If I don't reach out.. they are gone. 

My workplace brings me down more than anything, and ive tried out other jobs but they just don't pay as well. So right now I'm not working much.
I just don't know how to cope. 
I feel numb and no longer capable of achieving anything above a 5/10 on the mood scale. My boyfriend and I have a wonderful relationship, but i know this weighs on him because he is such an excitable person.
Does anyone have any sort of advice? 
I'd like to do therapy, but I have no insurance at my job and it's not in my budget.
I've tried friendship apps and going out to meet new groups.. no luck.

I disgusted the idea that I'm having fun, I cursed at myself for being happy. I realized, the child inside me is dead after all those years of chasing after people, seeking their attention and approval.

I don't even know who am I anymore.

I've been lonely pretty much my whole life, I always tries to start and initiate conversation, I always helps people without asking anything in return cause I just wants to be their friend.

But why am I always the last choice? They only talk to me when they need something, they only ask me out because all their friends are busy, when I talk my words mean nothing and ignored or cut mid sentence,  
if I don't text them first, they will probably forget that I ever exist.

I really wanted to die but reading other thread about how my death gonna hurt my family, I don't want that.

I feel stuck. At this point, I just want to focus all the time I have left on this earth into my career and money, cause atleast I will still have some purpose to continue.

Fantasizing,"I fantasize so often. I have no one to talk to because I don’t want help. My partner “doesn’t understand emotions”(their words ) so if I were to just finally relent to my urges then it’d be seen as a “surprise”. I have to pass on one day anyway so what is the difference if I go now? For the past few years, and on and off for as long as I can remember, I fall asleep by fantasizing about suicide. Or death of some other form. Like a car accident or some kind of tragedy that would spare me from the guilt of doing it myself. I have turned ugly and I don’t know who I am. I know things in my life are going wrong but I refuse to acknowledge those things because then I know I’m responsible for talking care of it when I just don’t care. I don’t feel affection like I used to. I don’t feel excited. Just scared all the time. I’m convinced there is someone out to get me and I want to get myself before anyone else has the chance to. I just don’t want to hurt my loving parents and siblings. But I am tired of this current shell im inhabiting. But I’m also scared. And I’m not interested in menial self harm for now. I used to harm myself in many ways. And back then when I felt this low that is what I’d resort to but now I don’t feel the urge to drag a razor or force my lunch up.

Just needed somewhere to write this. I feel so fucking lonely I want to cry.,"I need somewhere to get this out. I feel so lonely, and not even just an emotional loneliness, I genuinely am. My mother kicked my brother and I out after this huge fight about a lawsuit about a stupid will the rest of my family dragged us into. My fathers not alive anymore, which I mean, I’m kind of grateful for because he was heavily physically abusive. It’s just me and my brother now, and honestly it seems like he just hates me. He always comes home yelling, and threatening to hurt me when I’ve done nothing wrong. He doesn’t go through it that often, but when he does it’s so scary. I used to look up to him so much, he was my best friend. Then after everything happened, he got into weed and got this friend group and he started changing. I don’t even recognize him anymore. The rest of my family sided with my mother and is no longer in contact with us at all.

I did make a friend though, like an actual real life friend. The first real one I’ve had in years, and I think I annoyed her to death because she seems so uninterested in talking to me or wanting to do anything. I had this amazing online friend group, they were my reason and I loved them so so much. And then we all just started to drift, they were my only support, the only people I could talk to, and now the only time we message is when I’m in the middle of a panic attack and desperately need someone to talk to so I message them. They obviously hate me and that makes me want to cry because we used to talk on calls every day.

I’ve dealt with self harm since my father got sick (before he died) because he had convinced me that everything he did to me was deserved and every single little mistake I made, if he wasn’t there to show that I made it, then I had to. This past year has been so, so horrible. I don’t want these scars but I can’t stop. It’s getting so much worse, I’ve been cutting to fat and my brother found one of them and he got so pissed at me. 

Ive had a few attempts, most recent being a couple of months ago. My biggest one was back in November, I took a bottle of fluoxetine, a bottle of Advil, and just a bunch of other pills I mixed together. All it did was fuck up my organs and make my brother apparently hate me even more.

Having constant derealization/depersonalization episodes doesn’t help either. I used to get them every day, so it’s not as bad recently, but it’s definitely still at least a couple times a week. I just want to be normal. I wish I didn’t have to be terrified of going on walks (which is my favorite thing ever) and thinking a fucking building is melting or I’m in a dream. Everything is just so scary and I’ve been having so many breakdowns and anxiety/panic attacks and I hate it I hate it I hate myself so much. 

I’ve been starving myself recently as well. I wish I didn’t have to. I know I’m anorexic, it’s painfully obvious (direct quote from my old therapist) I normally go a couple days without food and then eat the bare minimum so I don’t faint. But I end up doing it anyway, and of course, my brother gets absolutely pissed at that too. Which I mean, understandable, but I’m trying to stop. It’s not like I want to count every single calorie I consume and think a godam piece of chicken is too many calories so oh no guess I can’t have that because it’ll make me go above my 400 calorie limit for the day.

I just can’t get rid of the thoughts. It’s every day now I think about suicide. Awhile ago I figured out this whole plan for a ‘peaceful’ way to do it, and then my dumbass decided to tell my old therapist about it and I got sent away. Every little tiny mistake I make the thought comes back. It doesn’t matter how good or bad my day was, it always ends with that thought and I don’t want to keep having to deal with it. I just want it to stop I want everything to go back.

I did start this new antidepressant medication though. I stopped taking my old ones because I heard they can cause weight gain and I was so terrified of that. But of course my idiot self keeps forgetting to take it (yes, I’ve set reminders) 

Honestly I don’t know why I’m even writing all of this. Just to put my thoughts down I guess. Really, all I want is for someone to just check in on me. I’m not saying I need like 50 people devoting their whole day to seeing how I’m doing, but just at least one person who cares enough. And not just because I ask them first or bring this up, but because they genuinely want to know. Because they care enough about me to want to know how I’m feeling. I mean it’s understandable if people wouldn’t want to, if I’m panicking I often send these stupid paragraphs to them and then I regret it after because if someone did that to me j wouldn’t know how to respond and I’m just putting them on the spot and then I apologize and I seem like a fucking wimp and I hate I feel so bad.",Lucid_Animals,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3nq8q/just_needed_somewhere_to_write_this_i_feel_so/

I might ruin everyone’s vacation and I do not care.,"In almost 3 weeks, on August 3rd is my 15th birthday. I don’t know if I can keep going that long, but I don’t want to ruin my brother’s birthday just 5 days after my own. Even tho he doesn’t like me, I still love him. And I think he’d show at least a bit of care for me. Everyone is really excited for my birthday, but I can’t keep living and it pains me that everyone else is so happy for me while I’m laying here with my 3 attempts that no one knows off, thinking about making it 4 and not chickening out again. School will be over in 2 and a half weeks, starting summer vacation that will last for 6 weeks. I don’t think I’m able to stay home for that long. I’m extremely uncomfortable around my family. If I kill myself before or during it, I would ruin it for everyone. But I’m starting to stop caring if others care. It was not my choice to be born and I know it’s extremely selfish of me to think that way but I don’t want to live for anyone else anymore. Who knows, might also ruin everyone’s last weeks of school/ work today.

My dad has a gun and is gonna kill himself one of these days andi know where the gun is. Should I steal it and hide it from him?,So my dad threatened to kill himself a few weeks ago with a knife and got hospitalized then lied his way out a few weeks later and a few days ago used all of his money he had to buy a gun. My parents are getting divorced cause he's an asshole and he's been really mad about that and I'm worried he's gonna try to hurt my mom or other family members then himself or just himself but either way he's gonna hurt someone. But idk if I should take the gun cause if I do he'll be absolutely pissed and will probably try to hurt me in some way but I care way more about the rest of my family so I think I might just take it from him so he can't hurt himself or anyone else.

The saddest realization I've ever had,"I recently started going to see a therapist after I broke up with my ex of 3 years, we were absolutely perfect for eachother, there was nothing we didn't both like or agree on. We started dating in high school and we were instantly the image of a perfect relationship to everyone we knew, even in our eyes we were. For some back story, as a child I was left to defend for myself since I was roughly 6 and it never got better after that, year after year I would be not only abandoned, but abused, told I was never good enough for anything, and left to fend for myself and my siblings, and as I grew up I got into the mindset that no one can be trusted or relied on, and that the only time someone loves me is when I can be useful too them. I never left that mindset till I met my ex, she showed me that all that was true, but after almost 2 decades of dealing with people who I thought loved and cared about me, just to have them turn once I wasn't useful, it was difficult to believe that for the first time in my life someone loved me unconditionally.
For the first 2 years of our relationship it went amazing, we were the image of an amazing relationship and I knew I found my true love, yet that old feeling came back to my mind and I found myself unintentionally becoming closed off from her and slowly self sabotaging the relationship until one day she left me, and it broke me. I'll never forget that feeling... I dont feel anything anymore. 

So I decided to try to get help, and this was where I had the worst realization. Now I believe that my ex loved me unconditionally, but I realized that I'm more scared of being loved unconditionally then I am of dying alone.

Life is unbearable ,"I’m a 31 year old woman and I honestly fantasize about just passing away in my sleep all the time. I have no relationship with any of my family except a mom who only talks about the newest diet she is on and only wants me to be okay so she doesn’t have to deal with my sadness , and my friends don’t even ever want to hang out with me because they are all codependent on their partners. I literally enjoy nothing and right when I wake up and open my eyes I feel flooded with anxiety, and then when I open my phone all I see are ads about how to get rid of cortisol face or whatever stupid diet trend is out now . I have no money despite working harder than my parents ever did. I don’t enjoy any hobbies or music or shows and even my vices like alcohol and weed don’t do anything anymore.

19 and already my life is screwed ,"Hi, idk how to intro this but oh well. 
Let me be clear I’m not looking for any sympathy, trust me when I say that I messed up my life it was no one else so sympathy will get me no where, to be fair I just don’t have anyone in my life who’s actually willing to listen to me so here we are.

Firstly let me start out by saying that I am a Christian, have been for my whole life. For those that are still here thank you. Now that we’ve ripped that bandage off where to really start. 
I guess I could start with the fact that I am alone, totally alone. I have people, just not people who want to pour into me without getting a lot more in return. As it stands I can’t remember the last time I actually opened up about how sick I feel, not physically but mentally. 

I have 1 friend she’s really awesome, she’s my best friend, I love her to death but her parents hate me. They think I’m turning their daughter into a lesbian and we only really get to hang out for 1-2 hrs at a time every other week and since I started going to another church I barely see her anymore. I miss her a lot but she has her own issues and I know I have no right to be selfish, her issues are far worse then mine trust me I know that beyond a shadow of a doubt but sometimes it feels like we never really talk about my life. I’ve told her some stuff about me and to be fair she has sat with me when I cried on the phone with her but whenever we talk now she’s always complaining about her job and her family because they suck. I love her to death but sometimes I just let the phone ring until I feel bad enough to call her back because I don’t want to continue to hear about her problems when I feel like I’m suffocating from the inside out. I love her, I really do please believe me that I would die for this girl and I want her to be my maid of honor one day but I wish I could just talk to her about me, and she wouldn’t just shrug it off and then move onto her own issues. I need help and she’s my only friend but it feels like she doesn’t want to listen to me because she doesn’t know how to handle it when I have stuck my neck out for her a million times. I was there for her when her grandfather died and her dog got hit by a train, and I did her hair for her graduation twice and I have always always done my best to be there when she needed me. Not to mention due to her parents abhorrence of me we can’t ever see each other anymore and talking on the phone will never replace being with her in person. I know it sounds selfish but I’m not trying to be. With her parents hating me and causing her life to suck i feel like i can’t help anyways but i care for her so much i just want to get her out of the situation she’s in but I’m also suffering so I can’t really help her.

As I mentioned I stopped going to the church she went to. I left for a multitude of reasons, that church ruined my life although in the situation I wouldn’t blame them. My parents were both pretty prominent figures in that church before their reputation was smashed into the ground because of me, granted I was a child but If I hadn’t made the choice i made maybe I would’ve had a better life, it all stems from that place god if i could go back and tear that girl a new one i would but I can’t so whatever. Anyways all that crap happened, really traumatic stuff but that’s not what is happening presently it’s just to set up back story.
Presently i attend church with my parents but just a few months ago i was attending that other church. I liked it for a while, i met my friend there and we had a few fun trips and stuff but because of the incident i never had any other friends really. I had one other that was friends with me and my bsf but she ended up turning on us, it hurt my bsf more then me tbh but I caused that too, i started some stupid fight and the girl never really talked to us again. I had another friend but it turns out she was just using me to find out more about my life and the crap 10 years ago so she could feed it to the church gossip strip so i broke it off with her. Then i just had me and my bsf which was ok although i never saw her because she was working or just not going to church. I was alone, so i tried therapy with the pastor. At about that time my bsf stopped attending because of family stuff and i had a breakdown in the parking lot on new years, it was bad. I only went to a few sessions before i gave up on trying because it seemed like there was no help for someone like me.
I have been going to this new church (not new I’ve attended before but i was mentally unwell and still am) and it seems to be ok for now but I don’t really trust anyone, it was the same at the last church, i had no one, or i was shouldering everyone else as a burden. I’m just tired not physically but mentally , i have been for a loooooooooong time but when i tell anyone that they don’t get it at all. 

Another thing, I’ve graduated high school, it should be exciting but it’s not. (This is the part where i messed up my own life, pls do not feel bad for me about this particular thing lol) I’m a fraud so to speak, i attended regular school up till the beginning of highschool when I started to do homeschool. I got ok grades at the regular school and when i started to do homeschool i guess my parents just kinda thought i was cool to just do it by myself, not sure but i was given a laptop and cds to do and for the first year it was ok, i occasionally cheated but nothing serious, just looking up the really difficult questions on my phone or whatever. It was when i got to the end of 8th grade where i found the grade books my mom hid. I took them of course (stupid teenage brain riddled with depression) anyways i cheated my way through the rest of the grades like big time, I wasn’t learning anything at all. It was easy really, my parents took their hands off my education because they were busy with work and again i was alone. My dad had big dreams for me, still does, but i can only remember one time where he actually helped me do my school work and that was when i was still in regular school, but when i was homeschooled all he wanted was my report card. Good grades means good daughter i guess lol. Anyways i screwed up obviously. I graduated but i knew nothing and by the time i was in 11th grade i realized this but I couldn’t do anything but keep cheating to pass the grade so daddy dearest didn’t think anything weird. At some point my mom found out but she never told my dad and instead just helped me cheat by giving me the books (maybe she felt like i was just using them to grade myself or that she just couldn’t tell my dad because he is an angry individual anyways, he might just kill me if he found out lol.) 
I remember one time where i was in my room with headphones on “studying” and my mom tried knocking but she couldn’t get my attention so she came in and we smoothed it out but i guess my dad heard my mom knocking and decided to come to my room, slam the door open, yell at me as i cried and then pulled on the handle with his foot at the bottom of the door pulling the handle so much its still loose to this day. He asked me about it once and i told him the truth but he just said he didn’t remember. So anyways safe to say i have no one i can beg to help me with this and if i did i fear society would kill me to lol. Like i said don’t feel bad for me this is my own fault. 
He scares me, he can be happy one minute and the next he can snap at me or my mom like a rabid dog, i begged him to help me with my resume a million times since he was a supervisor at a medical facility but he just told me to do it and he’d look over it but he never did, so i just did it myself and nobody wants to hire me which is making him upset with me lol, he asks everyday if i found another job and that i should go to the places and stuff but I don’t want to even listen to him since he can’t take a second to just be a dad, i think he doesn’t want to be my dad. I don’t know why, or what i did maybe i remind him. Of himself with all my mental issues but i just wish i had someone to show me what to do now. Tbh i think my only solution is to take a bunch of pills and forget about this haha. Just end it all while i have some dignity left. No money, no friends, no life, I’m just so alone and there’s no magic solution so guess what, ill just return to my fathers throne, end it all , all the pain and hurt i inflicted upon myself then my dad can miss me when I’m gone. 

Anyways thanks for listening to my ramble and please don’t feel bad for me i did this to myself.
Hope you guys have a good day :)",Disastrous-Chest4092,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2f0mb/19_and_already_my_life_is_screwed/
depression tout perdu en un jour,"Bonjour a tous

Besoin de parler du vécu qui est actuellement en train d'arriver et n'arrive plus à surmonter

Pour résumer ma situation j'ai 36 ans une compagne de 36 ans également avec qui nous sommes fusionnel, une entreprise de 7 salariés avec un salaire confortable, une vie simple d'entrepreneur qui roulait parfaitement 

Mais il y a 2 mois tout c'est écroulé subitement, mon activité c'est brutalement stoppé, l'administration m'ayant retiré les autorisations me permettant de travailler... et tout cela à cause notamment de MES propres erreurs et prise de décisions catastrophique 

Ne pouvant quasi plus travailler j'ai malheureusement dû licencier le personnel et doit faire face à de multiples problèmes : procédure judiciaire en cours, forte amende (en centaine voir millions d'euros), licenciement des salariés, prison mais vraisemblablement sursis, contrôle fiscal j'ai fais que de la merde avec ma société, impossibilité de payer les charges à venir, liquidation judiciaire, faillite personnel... Bref une erreurs que que je risque de payer toute mon existence

Depuis ma vie est devenu un véritable enfer, je vis dans le stress permanent; je ne dors plus que sous Stilnox et sous Lexomil, je n'ai plus le goût à rien, je suis en dépression sévère et n'ai que des idées noirs...

Je passe mon temps à ruminer, me dire que j'aurais dû faire ci faire ça, comment j'en suis arrivé là, j'en veux à tout le monde alors que le seul fautif est MOI MEME

J'ai perdu toute la confiance et complicité que j'avais avec ma compagne (l'une des rares chose qui me rendait heureux), nous allons perdre notre maison notre sécurité financière et surtout notre amour qui ne survivra certainement pas à cette épreuve

Je suis en train de sombrer et ai bien peur de ne pas pouvoir assumer toutes les problèmes qui risquent d'arriver.

But now? Now it feels like a place where I am left alone with my thoughts.

I have been seriously depressed since this happened.,"I worked 40 hours and got paid $8.75/hour.

In her daughter’s eyes, this woman can do no wrong. 

My girlfriend tells me we have a new job and I don’t have to worry because we’ll have money from now on. 

Her mom gave her the job. Said she was taking it over and trained her for a month to do so.

So we go clean this huge church with two buildings from 7pm-5am once a week for a month. 

We get the check for $1400 and her mom “changed her mind,” and she tells me she agreed to give her mom $700. I was pissed af. So I told her if she gave me anything less than $700 I would leave her. So I got $700, she gave her mom $700 and she kept nothing. Her mom took the money knowing her daughter was getting none of it. 

About a month passed and all we’ve been doing is fighting and we’re not the same. 

I finally gave her $350 bc I don’t care about the money. So we ended up making $8.75/hour.

Now she and her mom clean the church without me and it’s made me very depressed and feel alienated. We were both so happy to have something that was ours.

No matter what I say or do she will not see my side and anything I say she says I’m talking shit about her mom. She said I put a hole in her heart. Idk what to do.

THE MOST EFFECTIVE TRICK FOR DEALING WITH NEGATIVE FEELINGS,"Just believe me, your brain is not you. You don't have to understand it, just believe me. It's your machine. Next time when you're lazy to do something, tell yourself: it's your imagination. Brain, you're wrong. You only think, that you're lazy. You're actually not. Just get up and do it, you'll be fine. Still lazy? Omg, brain, stop bullshiting me. I'm not gonna let you trick me. I control you, you don't control me. I want to get things done and you're not gonna convince me that I'm lazy. I'm smarter than you. 

Treat your brain like a machine that is separate from you. Use it to your best advantage. If it does something you don't like, scold it. Talk to it. Everything you feel is an imagination of your brain. When you're happy it's just your brain's fantasy. It's actually not true. But let it be, because it's great to be happy! But when you're sad, just remember that it's an imagination. Command your brain to imagine different things. 

This helps to reduce the importance of your feelings and decrease their power over you.

I can't take it anymore.,"I'm a 14 year old male, I'm turning 15 the 20th of July. I just can't take It anymore. I have no friends, no one to trust. I never go out, not like I did in the past, but at least I was not so sad and hopeless. I have had suicide thoughts the first time when I was 8-10 (I don't remember). I have distressing dreams. I don't want to live anymore. On top of that, I'm a short a guy and always made fun of. I was bullied since the start of middle school, maybe even earlier. I haven't told my family, because they are very marrow-minded; especially my parents, in particular my dad. I'm because I have a ""nerdy"" attitude, although I'm not a teacher's pet, and because I'm short and weak, even if I work out. I don't eat as often, I don't care about my appearance, I don't shower as often as I did. This is going on for like 3 months. But I probably had depression since a really young age. I think I'm stupid, but when I realize I'm not I try to say stupid to enforce my vision. I didn't ever have a bright life, but my best moment was probably when I started liking my crush.
I probably don't even have something close to a bad life but I just feel like It.

In a vicious cycle with Zopiclone,"Sorry in advance, as I’m not sure exactly what my goal is with this post. Idk if I’m even posting in the right sub. I guess I just need to get this off my chest, so thank you in advance for reading and listening. 

Been taking Zops pretty consistently now at nighttime for the past few years. Sometimes I go a few nights without, but always end up falling back on it. Always take between 5mg-7.5mg- sometimes, very rarely, I’ll take a 10mg. But never more than that per night. I buy it online with crypto, which I know is risky but at this point in my life, I just don’t care. 

I take Zop, not so much for the sleeping benefit (although that is admittedly a great feature of it) but because it sedates my mind, and my thoughts. It numbs my hurt. It just allows my brain to be quiet and slip into unconsciousness, quietly. All this, I yearn for on a daily basis. 

I acknowledge that gradually, I’m disintegrating. I wonder if it’s because of the Zopiclone… but I’ve felt so terrible for so long (far, far before I ever started taking it), that I have my doubts. I’ve been sad for a long time. Maybe this is how I would be, Zopiclone or not. 

As it is, these days I feel like I am permanently encapsulated within a thick, dark fog. My mind is slow and languid. My speech is slow and slurred. I am tired; so, so agonisingly- yet blissfully- tired, every second of the day. My body feels like a lead weight. My limbs ache, despite doing nothing. 

Caffeine does not rouse me from this concious, coherent daily stupor. Nothing rouses me. I feel so numb. Food is an inconvenience that I can hardly ever be bothered with.

My mind and thoughts race throughout the day. And yet, I can’t make my body or brain actually do anything. The constant, dull ache behind my eyes is now almost a background sensation to me. 

Nothing seems or feels good to me anymore. Everything either feels like massive stress, or like nothing at all. Joy is a foreign concept that I have not experienced for a long, long time now.  I desperately look for anything and anyone else to blame for “making me this way”, all the while I don’t even attempt to take the necessary steps to help myself. I just don’t have the energy, or the strength, or the intellect. I feel as though I possess a grand total of 3 whole brain cells.

Idk if this is because of the Zops, or just because of depression or something. But it feels like, at the end of each thick, fog-filled day, when I’m exhausted from the mental fight of it all, and ashamed of how inept I am at life, Zopiclone and the Zop-sleep is the only thing that temporarily relieves me from my flat, grey, overcast existence. 

I just want to add that I’m not suicidal or anything (tbh I’m far too lazy and tired to bother). Has anyone read “I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream” by Harlan Ellinson? I just feel like the amorphous blob-guy at the end of the story; unable to live, and unable to die. Just… there. Existing. 

TLDR; I’m addicted to Zopiclone because I’m depressed, or depressed because im addicted to Zopiclone. Fuck knows which way round it is. ",Dapper_Spell_2894,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4sl42/in_a_vicious_cycle_with_zopiclone/
"Complete apathy, feels like a new extent of my depression","I am just so sick and tired of everything, I can't find interest in anything. Every single thing about this world and the people in it and this strange life and society we have created is bumming me out. 

I don't know myself like this. I have struggled with depression for a long time but there was always something I was striving for. I was always obsessing over something that must be the reason for my depression, for example the fact that I am not an actress even though I have wanted to be for my whole life. I would watch countless of interviews and movies and analyse them and I would still not be able to take action myself but at least I would constantly be able to tell myself, it's because of this, if you just reach that you will be happy. (I know it doesn't actually work like that, but it was just always something to keep me going, like dangling gold in front of myself somewhere just out of reach.)

But there is nothing, nothing I want, nothing I can imagine that could possibly make life feel worth it. Even self-destructive thoughts or things summon nothing. Whether I think of positive or negative things, nothing summons up anything at all. I want to cry because it's terrible feeling nothing but I can't even do that because I don't feel enough to cry. 

I feel like I have to do something, make a big change or something to get me out of this and get me to feel anything at all about life but I don't know how when I don't care for anything. Even if I think of travel, which I have the opportunity to do and have wanted to do for a long time, it just seems meaningless and a lot of trouble and effort and actually pain as I would be doing yet another thing that I thought would make me happy and that doesn't.

Suicide,"You do nothing but mind my own business, yet so afraid to even walk to the shop so you take a Uber. You get out the Uber car, walk into the shop and leave within about 3 minutes.

Everything is going right and I'm done,"I tried to kill myself earlier this year, but I got too drunk and passed out before I cut deep enough. 

I'm a 25 year old woman, I have a girlfriend we're planning to get married, lots of friends and a supportive family. But I am miserable. Not because of anyone else. I just hate myself. I hate my brain. 

In 2022 things were generally going well for me. I was making and playing music consistently, I had two decent jobs and I was going out multiple times a week. I was raped at the end of that year and ever since I just haven't been able to pick up the pieces. 

I've been unemployed for the majority of the time since, I only sleep about 1 out 2 days at best, when I'm awake the only thing I can do is distract myself with video games or youtube, and I'm too fucking lazy to pull myself up even a little bit And find a job, keep myself consistently medicated or even email a therapist.

My girlfriend would never say this but I can tell she's had enough, and the same goes for most of my friends. But I've tried everything I can think of and I just can't stick to it. 80% of every single day for the last year and a half the only thought going through my brain is suicide. How I'll do it. When I'll do it. The exact logistics of it. Writing out every bullet point I want to hit in my note. Every. Single. Day. Even when I try to force myself to stop, my brain screams KILL YOURSELF louder and powder in my ear. 

Every single day I wake up angry at myself, besides gray ass depression the only thing that enters my mind is rage and anger towards myself. 

So idk I guess I'm just venting. I have no reason to kill myself, I there's such simple steps that would make my life better. But I just won't do them apparently. So I'm done. I'm checking out.

I'm so fed up,"Already fed up because I'm lonely. Been dumped in February and I thought I was doing better

I joined clubs, gone swimming,lost a bit of weight, made friends.

But can't find a girl even just for fun. I feel so unloved 


And when I went to my friend's last time in the West, I almost caved in and sniffed cocaine. If it weren't for my female friend telling me ' don't "" I'd have sniffed it.

Instead, I swallowed 900 mg of quetapine (I'm meant to take 600) and had a dozen glasses of alcohol (ouzo, beer, wine...)

It's been a week and I still feel miserable even a few days after my 31st. I try my fucking hardest not to think of my ex and wondering if she's got someone else.

Even my female friend told me she wouldn't get laid easily cause I quote "" she doesn't shave and she's getting old"" (she's 31).

But right now in the middle of the night I keep thinking of killing myself. One reason that's pushing me over the edge is that I've got a DBs.

I threatened on my worst day my headmaster through text (it was a day after the break up and I was having a psychotic episode,
 Still I acted like a douche that day)

I wanna quit being a teacher but I'm worried employers won't hire me because of my DBs.

I feel so lost and when I hear my parents talking to their friends about my current situation I just feel like I should kill myself and restart a new life in another body

Setting a deadline for my life,"I'm 24M. Just waiting to pay my car off so I can put a permanent end to this loneliness. The loan is under my dad's name and I really don't want to put him into even deeper debt before I leave this world. I have about 4 years until my car is paid off. It feels surreal and exciting at the same time knowing that all of this will come to an end in just 4 years. I am genuinely excited and happy that I will be dead while I’m still young. 

All I ever saw romantically was ridicule and rejection throughout my short life, even after consistent dieting, exercising, lifting weights at the gym, and genuine attempts to make myself feel better and to socialize with others. I have just accepted the fact that I am too ugly to date anyone and I am never going to find a romantic partner. I was never meant for romantic connection. It genuinely makes me feel like I am less than human for not having any experience in this aspect, despite already being 24 years old. Therapy and meds don’t help me in the slightest bit. Looking back at it, they were both a complete waste of time. I finished an entire prescription of anti-anxiety medicine and it did absolutely nothing to better my mental state. Medication is useless.

I will die before I turn 30. I'd rather not live past this age and end up living to my 60s or 70s without ever finding a romantic partner. I know exactly who I am and I am absolutely certain that my life will stay this way if I don't die while I'm still in my 20s. I am a strong believer in fatalism and I am certain that there is no future for me where I am happy and fulfilled, no matter how much time or effort I put into myself. 

I have a few close friends in my life, but it will be very easy for them to find a replacement. I am very easy to replace as a person. There are many others like me in the world, and I am absolutely sure that everyone in my life will quickly get over my passing.

I am very serious about this and I plan on withdrawing out of my retirement funds to purchase a shotgun.

Been feeling this way since 14 years old with absolutely no end in sight. I have simply accepted that this will be my fate until I kill myself once my car is paid off. ",TooMuchMelancholy,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4lxpq/setting_a_deadline_for_my_life/

A vent on the problem of being social,"I (31M) have been depressed for as long as I can remember, but it really picked up during my undergrad 10 years ago. Been in and out of therapy and medication, and nothing seems to stick for long.  
  
I find one of the most tiring aspects of this whole ordeal is socialization, in that, my mask holds up when first talking with people, and then eventually slips in some regard. People don't like depressed people, less so when they are given a good first impression. They may give a couple more chances, but overall you're viewed as overly sensitive and a downer. I have moved around and lived in many different cultures, and had many social groups I was initially part of, but it seems like only a matter of time until it flops. I find this isolation difficult, aggravating, and infuriating. It's hard sometimes to not just give in and just isolate myself, to save both myself and others the time and energy. I am currently experiencing this again in a very small city where I just want to give up on it all.

In the end, depression always finds a way to leak out, and people would rather not have to deal with that, and I would rather not have to deal with yet another footnote of evidence of why I or others are not worth it.",JedPonders,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4pnqh/a_vent_on_the_problem_of_being_social/

I Wish My Mom Let Me Die.,"I am 30 years old. My mother is a very very wealthy woman ( I didn’t find out until I was 21). But I didn’t grow up that way. I raised thinking we were poor. My mom would let the gas, electricity, etc get caught off. Never got an allowance, and never went on fancy trips. 
I was not spoiled. I had jobs since I was 14, bought my own car. My mom constantly, every day 24 hours a day stated how much she hated having kids and having a house. And how we’re getting evicted the next day. Or we’re going be on the streets next week. Really makes you feel worthless. 

The only piece of advice my mom ever gave me was “major in health science”.  I did just that. I majored in biology and since then 9 years ago…to date over 5000 Job applications. No job. And 10 total interviews. For context I’ve been rejected from:
1300 entry level hospital desk jobs
500+ office assistant jobs 
500+ admin assistant jobs 
Dominoes delivery driver 5x
Post office cashier 10x 
100+ Office mail clerk 
Hospital greeter 20x 
150+ receptionist jobs
250+ bio research jobs 
Enterprise rent a car 15x 
Amazon warehouse worker 20x
I wasn’t the best student but definitely above average and I have a decent resume/work history. Still, I’ve done evey applicable google cert. hubspot cert. Microsoft cert. countless resume/cover letter courses. I’ve emailed almost 300 hiring managers. Zero have ever responded to me. 
I got a 14/hour job at a medical office and that’s where I’ve been the last 4 years. A few years ago I developed a cancerous and painful tumor. I asked my mom if she could help me pay for an MRI. She said we couldn’t afford it. And said “I’ll pray for you”. After 6 months in agony still working. I found a doctor that took my shitty insurance and he said he could keep me comfortable for year or so before the cancer killed me. Since I couldn’t even begin to afford treatment. I came to peace with that. I had a minimum wage job, no savings, I lost the love of my life who waited patiently for years for me to get a decent job, and nothing to show in life. I accepted it  and I was ready to die. 

At the 11th hour my mom swooped in, talked me off the ledge, got me better insurance, and got me cancer free. 6 rounds of chemo and 3 surgeries. I am now cancer free. But at the end, my mom left me with the bills and went straight back to her cold dismissive ways. High five figures that I could never pay back. I am back where I started in a perpetual cycle of rejection but now with staggering medical debt. 

People say go back to school or get this or that certification but I could never afford too then and definitely not now with the medical debt. 

I still drive the same car I had when I was 17 and it’s on its last legs. I tried to join the military but my diagnosis made me “unfit for service”  I don’t know what to do…I don’t have any hope.

"30F “high functioning” autistic female, unable to keep going","I spent all my childhood in my own mind, playing video games, playing pretend, anxious about OCD thoughts and that manifested in panic attacks and sometimes aggression.  In highschool I had friends all of a sudden.  In college I was depressed because I truly had no idea what to do.  I was gripped by a terror.

The terror went away around when I met my boyfriend.  For 4 years I deluded myself into believing I could go into this niche career with so much socialization required.  But for at least 3 years, I felt so free of the terror.  I could live and play pretend house, dreaming of a future that would never come.  Would we own a dog when we married?  What would we do when we took a trip to Japan?

And now its becoming clearer that this career is not a good fit for me.  Maybe no career is a good fit for me.  And my boyfriend is anxious as I have been on voluntary hold already.  He wants a house and maybe some healthy children that I can’t give to him due to my genes.  He hasn’t broken up with me yet, but we have planned on moving soon.

And I kind of want to end it here, in this apartment while he’s out at work and I can set up a sign to call the police,  instead of subjecting my parents to the horror of it all somewhere down the line.

I don’t want to go back to inpatient.  They don’t understand just how fucked up it is to be autistic, to miss everythinng socially.  To be so alone.  ",Mourningdove21,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4zydl/30f_high_functioning_autistic_female_unable_to/

He is turning 10 on July 18th. I want to be back there for him and with him as soon as possible. I can't describe how much stress this has caused me mentally and physically.

But it isn't about me anymore. I need to get back to him and I can't do it on my own.I NEED HELP. PLEASE.


Here is a back story to what happened to get me in this situation. At the end of last year 2023 around November I lose my home that I worked to keep for two years. ( A lil back story. I'm not trying to bash anyone or place all blame on anyone because I'm at somewhat fault as well for not seeing the signs. I was blinded by what I thought was love. It all started on Christmas Eve 2021 when my life began to change. My and my girlfriend of a year at the time were in a a really bad car accident. She was injured pretty bad. So I took on the mantle of providing for our family. This turned out to be a crucial decision. I spent the next two years busting my tail to provide for her and her daughter as well as my own three kids I have. It was working out pretty good for a year or more or so. I was able to maintain our home and both our cars. It started to get overwhelming after such a lengthy period of time. In this time I exhausted all my avenues of trying to stay afloat and allowing her to heal properly by staying at home and me taking all responsibilities for everything. I maxed out all my credit cards and was working two jobs day and night to try to be the man and keep everything that I had gotten for us. I finally after so long pressured her to start looking for a job I could no longer do it alone. Which gets to where the main problems started to happen. I didn't realize how much pressure I was putting on her because I was stressed out and maxed out. Well this pressure actually made things worst because now things she didn't say before came to light. Which was she was depressed on how the car accident made her look and feel and she shut down. So for the next half of year or so when I begged for help and pleaded I couldn't do it anymore. Things took a turn for the worst. Instead of helping me she shut down. Then month by month we ended up getting lights turned off. Next month water turned off. It was just a domino affect. One thing lead to another. Robbing Peter to pay Paul as they say. Finally it came to a head and we were kicked out of our home because turns out she was not paying the bills like I thought she was. Which is why I take blame I put all that on her to pay the bills (as in call in and make sure they were paid since I was working to make the money for them. All while she was not doing that. She was depressed coming to find out because of how she felt after the accident. So instead of paying the bills she used lots of the money for self care which turned out to be cheating as well. So we are kicked out and all of our things put on the curb. I was then forced to move states away from my kids with family because I had no where else to go. I'm am cracking under the pressure mentally and physically to be quite honest. Seeing my son struggle ever since I had to leave is heart breaking. I'm only asking for help to fix my car and gas to get back there. I already have a friend that is going to allow me to stay with them until I get back on my feet so I can be closer to my kids. I have secured a job for when I get back there so I'm not asking for handouts and not doing anything positive to help myself. I just need a little help to get ahead.


Anthing would help whether it's a dollar or two or if your feeling more generous. I just want to get back to my son where I belong and where he needs me. I thank everyone in advance for taking the time to read my story and possibly helping. Thank you may God bless us all.

Struggling to determine exactly what is going on...any help is appreciated,"Hi all,

I have been struggling with Depression and likely Anxiety for 20+ years, but in the past 10 it has gotten worse. There was a point where I was relapsing into deep depression 4 to 5 times a year that took a month or more to recover from. I was doing a little better, but now I am dealing with something I am not sure how to handle.

It first happened a few months ago on a work trip. I had just finished up for the day and was looking forward to getting back to my room to relax and watch a movie. I got into my room and sat on the side of the bed, and then it started. The best way I can describe it was a heat starting in my feet and slowly rising, as it moved up my body I could feel all of the concerns I usually struggle with during depression creep its way back in to my mind. I couldn't control it and that scared me which of course made things worse. It took a week for me to get back to myself. 

I am struggling through the fallout of the the same thing now. I again was just relaxing and it started to come over me in the same way. I am someone who does a lot of research when I struggle with things, and I think these might be panic attacks? 

The thing that scares me is that I can not seem to stop them. I try breathing exercises, meditation, exercise, but I can't stop it. I am on meds for depression, Sertraline and buspirone, but I am at a loss for how to control this or at least prevent it. Any ideas or help?

"i just want to vent as well, i just feel so alone","i have months that I'm not able to work, i have wasted so many resources.  
i lost a business when i had everything repaired and ready to go, i lost my family investments, i had marriage relationship problems during the process, i had a baby during the process, my baby needed heart surgery during the same time. i have pushed everyone of my support circle. i ended my marriage because we had so many emotional struggles that i couldn't be for here and i have never felt emotionally supported during all of this, it felt like i was the glue of everything. that didn't had a single purpose, but manage to keep everything together. you know, at my cost.  
i keep doubting my worth you know,  
maybe i have always been a duck up.  
why do i keep trying to justify it?  
now that i am all alone, i found so little of me, i don't even know where to start from this again and again.  
i feel like i have never will escape from feeling like this again, you i have always been the first to look for help i have had therapy before, they had told me that there is a high chance im surrounded by egoisitc people.  
you know being emotional as a man is not well treated.  
or worse now that i am a father.  
i hate the fact that i am failing them you know my baby girls.  
im just afraid that they will treat me as their mom will you know.  
your mom the one that doesn't let me parent because shes a perfectionist.  
im the best dad from our family, i am the dad that is trusted to stay with them.  
but im always short, i have learned not to take it personal, but know that i have removed your mom from telling me this one way or another, now i am an absentee father. what i have never wanted to be. i have been dealing with these for months and the thought of this has been paralysing me just like it is now that i have taken action. so i don't know whats best, being with your mom and being depressed or mom being alone and depressed.

I am able to find jobs, you know my dad has, he has been supporting me for a while now, because he is good, but he has also been the person to hurt me the most you know, i haven't been working for awhile now, patience runs thin, and i haven't been able to find support, one of my friend left, because i gave him the idea, i know for a fact. haha and i don't have friends, in my mental health journey i decided that i would focus on my family. since i appreciated all their support, but at the same time i never was able to carry my own weight. i only did when we were young, i am the eldest, and when we were in the house as kids i worked and gave mostly to my family i wasn't able to save, it always came back to the house.

so now im just here whining and crying about how unfair life is, when it hasn't been unfair. i have been blessed many times, but i just wasted them, paralyzed.

For maybe the past week, I’ve been breaking down and crying every single day. I am right now. I’ll think of something or an interaction with someone just triggers a, “yeah.. I’m definitely going through with this” thought. It’s just happening a lot more often, like throughout the day and I can’t stop wanting to cry/crying every time it happens.

Albinism makes me feel like I should end my life,"This post may sound very dramatic, but it is my true relationship with my condition.

In my early teenage years I had a very bad period and I got depressed. The reason is that during that period I first really realized that albinism would severely limit my life, and since then I've started to experience suicidal thoughts.

I really feel like I'm not understood by anyone when I talk about my disease. I have a severe form of oculus albinism which gives me a 20/100 vision, and a slight form of oculucutanous albinism. I can't even stand at home with windows opened without the sunlight hurting my eyes, and apparently no one seems to take this seriously. I've just stopped talking about this when it happens and just go somewhere else. I also have a lot of difficulties doing simple tasks like using a computer, using a smartphone, reading a book, watching tv and, of course, driving. 

I think I will eventually end my life for this. It's something I have thought a lot about in the past, and sometimes I've got really close to doing that. I started to get psychological visits, but that didn't really help. I know that I have to accept it and that there are a lot of the worst genetic diseases out there, but in the real life it seems like everyone has a normal life, and that hurts. It hurts a lot. I can't accept the fact that I will never see the world as it truly is, or that I will never be able to see the sky without sunglasses, and without my eyes that still hurt while I'm wearing them. 

You can tell me the things that everyone keeps telling me from years, such as that I have to accept it, that I can still have a healthy life etc. I'm just not normal, and what I'm seeing isn't normal. I'm not even supposed to still be alive and got this far and I will never be like anyone else.",Neither_Affect_6139,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2aapz/albinism_makes_me_feel_like_i_should_end_my_life/

Is it even worth all this hassle?,"I really hope I don’t end up posting a long story, but here it goes.

I don’t have the best relationship w my father. He may think we do, I talk to him, I respond… I act pretty normal. But I absolutely hate him. He is impatient and extremely ill tempered. 

Recently, my mother became ill and is undergoing intense physical and occupational therapy… and my father has not been patient with her at all. I have become her caretaker. At times, he expresses his frustration and anger towards me. 

My husband isn’t any help either… we’ve been married 10 years, he’s not employed and has major gaps in his resume. I’m tired of taking care of the both of us, being responsible for the both of us… this guy wants children, but won’t do any of the work to take any sort of responsibility that will come w managing a household or raising children. Quite frankly, I am grateful that we haven’t had any children. 

In the last two months, I have neglected my health, mental health, and my hygiene to take care of my mother, to be berated by my father and deal w my childish husband.

Is life even worth living at this point? ,"Some facts about me:

\* I'm 25, soon to be 26 and I stayed inside my house for almost a decade (From 2014 to 2024.) Dealing with depression/anxiety.

\* Never had a job.

\* Don't have any friends. 

\* Came from an incestuous family.

\* I live in a shitty little town —roughly 6 thousand people— with no opportunities.

\* Never had a partner. 

\* still a virgin, never kissed anyone, never gone out on dates etc..

\* I'm black and a homosexual — gosh!!! Could it get any worse??? Absolutely!!!!— overweight and unattractive. 

\* I have no one to support me financially.

\* I have nothing.

I wish I were in a better place today, I wish I had a better family, a normal family, I wish I had someone to support me emotionally...  It hurts seeing people succeed in life while I'm here, stuck at home, I feel like I was left behind.. I have so many situations in my life that I never had the chance to experience, and it's not that the opportunities presented itself to me and I turned my back on them, certain opportunities were never offered me in the first place, It has been incredibly difficult, I wasted so many years of my life, my youth is gone now. I'm feeling lost, I don't know what to do honestly, I have gone out trying to find a job, but for whatever reason no one will hire me, not even the local grocery stores. 

What am I supposed to do? I'm scared. Truthfully, I do not want to kill myself, I want to live!!! I just wish life weren't this difficult. I'm not asking for anything glamorous, I just want to live a calm, simple, life... A  stable job, have friends, a partner, have a dog or two, start a family, live as comfortably/peacefully/peaceably as I fucking possibly can. That's it! I'm not asking for much!!! 

I just want someone to talk to in REAL LIFE, All I want right now is affection — in a non sexual way— I haven't hugged anyone in years. Can you imagine that?? I'm not even exaggerating, I have literally no one to talk to besides myself and the walls..  I'm the unluckiest guy on earth!!! Damn!! For so many years I had these fantasies about someone knocking on my door, looking  for me, coming to my rescue, but that never happened, and it never will. 

As I have mentioned, my family was incestuous, so we do have lots of issues. We barely talk to each other, we go weeks and months without exchanging a word.. My mom's new boyfriend is a morbidly obese alcoholic, my older sister found herself a husband and she moved away and never talked to us again. 

Recently my mother had both of her legs amputated —due to diabetes mellitus— and I am her caregiver, and I will probably be her caregiver for the rest of her life. Problem is: If I do killl myself I will be killing my mother —indirectly— as well. Because who's going to take care of her? Her boyfriend spends 99% of his time drinking, or high on drugs, or stuffing his face with food!!! 

The question is: Is there any way that I can improve my life or is it over for me??? Can someone please give me an honest answer? Do I still have time to live a normal and happy life?? Keep in mind that I am approaching my thirties... 

By the way, sorry if my post doesn't make any sense/ is unclear. I was homeschooled so I do not have a lot of knowledge.

A permanent solution to a temporary problem? How temporary?,"I'm 48. Single. Gay. I've been struggling with my mental health for decades. I've had 8 therapists. Tried 4 different meds (one has worked well enough to keep me alive so far). I've given up drinking, surrounded myself with a great support network who I support too. I could write a book on my own mental health.I got fit. Gave up defined sugar. Get cardio maybe 4 or 5 times a week. I'm popular, smart, funny, talented, warm, welcoming, I have dozens of friends. And well over 10 close ones. I make friends easily. I am luckier than 99.99% of people who have ever lived. I live in one of the best countries in the world for LGBT rights. But I've been lonely all my life. A lot of LGBT people of my generation suffer from loneliness because they hide their true selves from everyone in their life for a long time. There's a barrier there and we learn to live with emotional isolation.I've watched my 3 younger siblings have relationships, get married, have children, settle down. I have never had a relationship. The loneliness for affection is debilitating. I feel worthless and old. My poor mental health means I struggle with employment. I find it reasonably easy to find work but end up in incredible emotional pain after a few months. And then leave. I am approaching my 50th birthday and it makes me feel like a failure. I have thought about suicide at least once every day for over a year. I rang the suicide help line a few months ago. Attended therapy with them. But they're focussed on crisis management. This isn't a crisis. This is the way I live. A life of feeling like this is tortuous and doesn't seem worth it. It seems to be getting worse as I get older. My hope of recovery is fading.

I feel like I am stuck in life and olanzapin drug makes me a robotic zombie,"Hello. Since I was 14 years old all my joy I had in life was to get home alone and play videogames. I've also been reading novels and I like listening to music. That's it. I have no friends and I don't want any. I have maybe one friend but when I'm with him, it's like putting on a mask and being a different person than you are.

I always only had one wish to find true love, some girl who understands me well and cares for me. But now I think this dream is impossible and I will never find someone. So what am I supposed to do now? Just go to work to get home and play videogames??? There is no person I like to be with and I can't find a girl who loves me. That's always what I wanted but I never found it. I never had a girlfriend and I'm 27 years old.

I am a very nervous and anxious person but I can hide it well. This Olanzapin drug makes me a zombie and I can do full weekend just laying in bed and sleeping. It's literally prescribed to insomnia patients, I didn't even have that. Read the reviews on [drugs.com](http://drugs.com) for olanzapin and you will be amazed what a crazed potent drug this is that I can never get rid of. It's impossible to withdraw.

And now I'm stuck in a loop going to work and getting home and I never meet anyone I don't even know where to go, and I can't go anywhere. Even if I went somewhere what is the potential that I find a special girl to care for someone like me. I am a special person and I like to be treated special. It just has to click for both of us.

I dont want to be here,I dont want to live anymore. I’ve never felt loved by anyone and everyone who hasn’t ignored me has just given up on me . I dont know what’s wrong with me and I keep doing everything wrong. I’m 15 now and my family has given up on me. every time during my childhood that I would cry or be self destructive they would just tell me to shut up and yell at me. During elementary I’ve been told that I’m an embarrassment and that no one likes me. Everything makes me feel so isolated and it’s gotten to the point that I can’t even leave the house without breaking down and feeling like an embarrassment to everyone around me. l know everyone’s against me and I hate my self just as much as they hate me. When someone is nice to me it feels new to me because throughout my life I’ve only been hated and taken advantage of. I’m thinking of ending it all I’m just a waste of space at this point and I don’t deserve love.,Over_Egg_6819,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e49afr/i_dont_want_to_be_here/
I'm a glorified household chore robot,"It's literally the only thing I ever do anymore. I feel like I always have to be at someone else's beck and call and I've stopped thinking about that might drive me to keep living. I don't find time and energy for hobbies, and even on the rare occasions when I can try something I inevitably fail or don't try in the first place.

I no longer have any friends and my family doesn't know if these thoughts, as I hide them pretty well after 15+ years of practice, so I'm all alone... And frankly speaking I deserve nothing more. Happiness is a privilege that a thing as selfish, useless and disappointing as me does not deserve.

I've been to therapists and on medication but nothing works. It feels as if depression has become my default state, so ingrained in my personality that I can't see myself existing without it.

I was supposed to die 5 years ago now and I'm just living past my expiration date to avoid the pain I would cause to my relatives.

My mom's an asshole,"My mom blames me (18M) for my little brother's behaviour which would be playing games and not going outside much I guess, which wouldn't be true. Anyway I dont spend a lot of time with my little brother because I really cant think of anything to do with him and he also has a different dad so we dont hangout almost ever. I do hangout with my step little brother (has a different mom) and I do enjoy spending time with him because he always asks me out and has something to do. no my little brother does not ask me or anyone out and so we dont do stuff together. I just dont think it is my fault that he acts like he does, he also has adhd and I dont know how that affects his mentality.

 I feel like he might be depressed and one cause would probably be our mother who loses her mind if we dont go do something with her. For example today she asked my lil bro if he would like to go ""frisbeeing or swimming or to fucking hell"". Obviously no one in our family likes to hangout with her because she acts like  she is a good person and all but then just decides to fuck all and ruin everyones day. I have tried to go with the whole family to somewhere like camping but everytime something slightly annoying happens like my brother saying that I dont like this or something along those lines she can't stand it. 

I am depressed bc of her constantly saying negative stuff about me. She told me angrily that ""people at your age are working summer jobs!"" yeah obviously when they have supportive parents and not a crazy single mother. I would like to tell her that but Idk what the conequences would be so I will just try to bear her until I can move somewhere else.

I don't deserve my boyfriend's unconditional love ,"Basically as it suggests\~ I'm a 21 year old (F) who has struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a preteen. This is my first and I hope only boyfriend but I feel my own mental health struggles are causing a rift in our relationship. He has told me he resents me for the times i've gotten irrationally mad at him. I can see where he comes from and when i'm overstimulated or overwhelmed I don't handle it well, plain and simple I can be a bit of a b\*tch. On top of all this, my mood changes so rapidly he feels he has to walk on eggshells sometimes, I get in depressive moods which tell me that I don't deserve love and I don't deserve him. 

Further, I feel sometimes I wish i'd die or be murdered so he could let go of me (of a future with me) because all I want is for him to be happy. Although it would break me, its worth letting him go so he can be happier, more fulfilled, and appreciated in a relationship than he is now with me. I feel he deserves so much more than what I am giving him and I would die just to do that. I have told him on occasion these exact thoughts which has left him emotionally numb. I can tell that he has grown tired of this constant narrative of mine, he often tells me to ""just not"", and I sense I have caused him emotional trauma since he rarely and typically refuses to express his emotions with me anymore. 

I hold so much guilt for the pain I have caused him and I wish he would focus his attention towards someone more worthy of his unconditional love. 

I have gone to years of therapy on and off, I contextualize and intellectualize my emotions so much that I always feel multiple emotions at once in a given situation and fall into depressive patterns such as these whenever a stressor is present (intense uni schedule or narcissistic mom). All I want to do is not feel so many emotions anymore and sometimes I think its better for my boyfriend and myself if I died.

I’ve been through so much my mom doesn’t love me because she was told not to when I was way younger. My parents haven’t built a connection that you would with your kid only with my siblings. Because of that when they divorced my dad stopped talking to me. It’s been two years. He has said he knows I haven’t done anything wrong. But he did it because he was mad at my mom. That’s how worthless I am to him. I see my siblings live the life I should of had. Friends fun parents care about them. Instead my life was hell from the age of 4 I should of never been born. The only people in my life have, lied on me, beat me, hated me, and treated me like shit. I have no one. I talked to this guy on this app maybe 2 years ago and he went through a lot growing up I bet he would understand but I was too shy to ask for his contact maybe I would of had someone to talk to today. The app is gone I’ll never find that guy again. My auntie ruined my life and it’s over for me she’s the most evil person I know everything bad in my life is because of her. She did so much to me she is sick in the head and no one loves me she made sure my parents took me out of school and homeschooled me so I’m alone I even tried to make friends with someone a year ago because I heard my mom talking to her mom on the phone about how alone and sad she was at her school because she had no friends and was gonna graduate. I was invited to her graduation dinner last month and she ignored me almost the whole time to talk to her new friends and they kept going to the bathroom to talk about me, mostly instigated by her. I only know this because one of them looked at me and said “He’s giving me anxiety” thinking I couldn’t hear them. Then they all went to the bathroom again this happened 5 times. We both hung out together with our moms with us because we both couldn’t drive. I thought I made my first friend and she was similar to me but no I didn’t want to believe bad of her until someone told me yesterday that it had to be what they were doing. I can’t believe it. I was sad that day because of what I been through in my life and she was talking about me with her buddies so many times. I can’t believe this is what I get out of life.

Any advice for someone wanting to end their life very soon? ,"I (15 year old female) have been feeling this way for a while now. I’ve been struggling with my toxic mental health for a long time now and nobody around me seems to care about me at all. My mum always just shrugs off everything I say to her yet tells me I can go to her for literally anything. My dad’s worse tho he always shouts at me and tries to manipulate and gaslight me into thinking I’m a bad person every single chance he gets. Tho, he’s not exactly wrong about that I’m not a good person I’m a worthless bed rotter who watches g0r3 in my spare time and wishes I was the person dying in the video. Disgusting right? yeah ik. My sister hates me too she treats me like I’m a weirdo and always acts like everything I say is stupid which makes me feel stupid yk? Not only that I once ran away because I had another argument with my parents and I tried to kill myself. The first time I ran away that night I had a knife with me but, I wasn’t fast enough and they caught up to me and forced me to go back home. They didn’t even care about me they just said I was “making a scene.” The second time I ran away I couldn’t take a knife with me cause my parents prevented me from getting to the draw with the knives in it so I left without one. My plan that time was to just keep running until I found another way I could end my life like jumping into the canal and drowning myself. Well, long story short I got brought back home that time too cause the police were called. It was strange tho cause I didn’t feel scared or worried about getting in trouble with the police when I had to talk to them I felt comforted like I was finally being listened to. I felt attracted to the policeman that was talking to me like he was the first man in my life to ever be a good man to me. It was amazing. But, he left eventually and the feeling I had left with him it was so disappointing. But, I’m not gonna mess up this time. I’m planning to run away again very soon not sure when but I’ll figure it out soon. Except, this time I’m gonna take my mum’s car instead of running. I’m gonna crash the car with so much force that my death won’t even feel real. I can just imagine the cold air on my skin and the illuminating traffic lights as I drive.

Incredibly exhausted. 16F,"Recently went through such a minor mishap with a girl that I know over social media and I feel like it’s really put into perspective for me how much my life has real gone to shambles. We had a misunderstanding and I don’t know her well at all so you’d think it doesn’t really matter, but as she began posting with friends and about her confident mentality it made me realize I don’t have any of those things. I don’t have friends, a support system, someone I can confide in when I need to just let out my emotions. I’m stuck with my thoughts alone all day long, especially now since it’s summer. Just alone in my house all day by myself with my thoughts. I’m about to be 18 soon and I’ve never been to a party, spoken to someone romantically, been to a friends house, or even hung out with anyone outside of school. I’m usually okay with being alone and until recently I never seemed to realize how much I’ve been avoiding acknowledging it, because I thought it was something to be prided in. The only good days I’ve had were from in my childhood, which even then I was struggling so badly. My mother and my sister struggle with mental health issues and while being abused as a child and trying to figure out why this was happening to me, I was simultaneously having to support my mother and sister the best I could. My mother has grown from that and apologized for her actions, we have a great relationship now but nothing has changed from them needing my support. I just miss when I could wake up and not worry. I’m soon going to have to worry about college, jobs, death, adulthood, etc. My heart is heavy every day I wake up. I haven’t had a good summer since I was little, this one was going well and this situation that happened just brought everything to light for me. I’m so miserable and didn’t really realize it until recently. I just want my family to be happy, and to be at peace. I don’t mean to be selfish but I hate putting out so much kindness and understanding into the world to receive nothing in return, I just wish that everything could be okay and someone could understand me but that isn’t how life works. No one is obligated to understand me, because they’re all living their own lives. I just feel like this world isn’t meant for me, I feel like I’m going to die by suicide.

There are people caring and trying to be there for me but i crave to be alone for the last one- one and a half year, and it doesn’t stop. I had lots of people in my life when this first started and right now i have two. And im trying to drop one of them too. I dont want to do this. 

I dont feel anything about my family too. I cant process having no emotions and its scary. ",AmbitiousContest9361,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1n3ab/i_need_someone_to_see_this/

School anxiety and depression ,"Hi, I’m a 23(F) University student who has been struggling with diagnosed anxiety and depression for 9 years (7 years diagnosed). 
I get extremely anxious whenever I think about studying, am studying or when I know that I have to go back to uni soon. I haven’t been able to sleep well, so I often wake up depressed. It’s not that I have trouble falling asleep but I get depressing dreams or nightmares. Everytime anything related to my course or university pops up whether it’s an advertisement, part of a TV series, movie or I overhear conversations, I get rly anxious. 

I dropped out of my first course in 2021, took a gap year, started a new 1 year course in 2022 (graduated), basically took another year off due to inevitable placement delays, and is heading into my 2nd semester of first year doing an undergrad in psychological studies.

I’ve been crying almost everyday and been trying to get my mind off things, but I still struggle a lot. Tbh, I have thought about seeing a psychologist again but just the thought of making appointments and finding time to actually talk already gives me anxiety. 
I’m already working PT and studying. 

Ik that probably focusing on studying is more important, but in this economy.. I can’t rly afford to quit my job bc I need it to pay for rent and for other expenses. 

I have no motivation for anything.. I constantly feel stressed and have negative suicidal thoughts however, Ik that I will never actually do it due to fear of pain. I want to leave this place so bad but I’m terrified of doing it. 

I used to have a career goal but university has been me change my mind twice, so now I feel stuck.. 

Atp, I’m just trying to get a degree for the sake  of my family so that they could back off a little bit when it comes to my life.

I feel like everyone is against me,"I had a mental breakdown I’m honestly still recovering from last week and I’ve never felt so horrible of myself. I’ve always wanted positive attention… and to be liked by other people. Something I felt I could never acquire. I feel like I’m such an unappealing person and like I’m a constant embarrassment and I also feel like people are always scheming or making fun of me behind my back.

I’ve struggled with this notion for so long. I look back towards evidence since high school that supports it. I’ve just always struggled to be myself because I’m always in my head socially. I just want to be a decent person people want to be with but it just feels like I can never get anyone to care

Because I felt like I couldn’t trust myself in reality, I’ve drawn to social media to try to get the attention I’ve always wanted except I feel like I’m doing the same exact thing. Desperately seeking attention leading to me ultimately embarrassing myself while I feel like others are scheming against me

I don’t know why I’m like this. Whether my fears are true or not, I can’t stop letting it affect me. I don’t know how I’ll ever make genuine connections if I’m like this all the time.

Too many strings attached ,"I want to preface this by saying I feel kinda guilty for posting it. There's so many people dealing with monumental issues and suicide, and my heart goes out to ya'll, but I'm hoping I can get some empathy for my own painful but less critical situation. 

I have been dealing with heavy depression for 10 years, started meds last year and they are kinda helping. I left a 3 year relationship a few months ago because I kept falling in and out of depressive episodes leading to the decline of the relationship. During the end also realized I felt trapped with her. I loved her more than any person but being constrained was creating more unhappy feelings than she was creating happy ones. The irony felt cruel. I always love a good excuse to self destruct, so I did and I left her right after. 

Now I'm with someone else. She's poly, and I guess I am now too. I tried so hard to be friends with my ex but she found out I rebounded and now she told me she never wants to speak to me again. I miss her like crazy. What did I trade her for? I'm falling for this new person (who is someone I've been just friends with for a year) and she is in a long term relationship with another guy, and were also together in whats becoming pretty intense. I miss the previous love of my life and Im falling in love with someone who will always have others. I'm ok with that for now...but I'm starting to feel this creeping, weighted sense of hopelessness that I have been right all along - I will never be happy no matter what I try.

I’ve had problems my whole life with comments on my looks, I’ve never had a relationship last longer than 2 months, I try my hardest to fit in and I have found friends in my life. But still no matter what I do to change my hair, my clothes my personality anything, I still don’t feel good in my body. I’ve tried to be myself, I’ve tried to change myself for other people but still to no avail. It’s so hard being ugly, some don’t like me just because of the way I look no matter the way I am, or what I do. I have tried substances before nothing crazy just w**d and alcohol. It didn’t do anything for me, it didn’t make me feel good or feel any better about myself, so I have since quit doing all of that. I also am addicted to p*rn which is a problem I constantly hate myself for. I’m am a Christian and want to change for the better it’s so difficult especially in this day and age. Also I have many people in my life who love me including a mom and dad, grandparents, and many sibling. But if I am being honest the only one that truly keeps me alive is my mom, I have never tried to commit, and don’t wish to, but if my mom isn’t in this world with me the next day it would be possible.

Can a person subconsciously attempt suicide?,"Awhile ago I took some old adhd medicine that I used to be on. I took like 8 pills and at the time I told myself it was to get High. Even tho the particular pills had never given me any sense of what you think of when someone says they’re high. Part of it was also because I had stopped percs a month ago and was craving anything shaped like a pill. Idk either way my heart rate sky rocketed and I had to put my head under cold water in the bath cus I heard somewhere cold water slows down your heart rate. I was thinking about that today and began to wonder could it have been a subconscious attempt to kill myself. Because at the time I was crazy fucking miserable. I was cutting constantly, some of the scars are still pretty obvious even today. I hate looking at them. Anyway, maybe it was me subconsciously trying to kill myself?

I lack of everything, I barely have friends and I have several problems with finding a gf because of my interest that doesn't match the ones that generally people from my city have (I have almost had a gf that was literally the female version of me, but because of my lack of experience I bottled it just like Arsenal did in the premier league last two seasons. Other than this I have because of her serious trust issues and I can't even express my feelings). When I will finish school (in a year) I won't have any assurance in my life anymore: I'd to go to university but mainly because I wanted to increase the chance to meet new people but I don't think I will go there because I don't really like study; the other choice is working but in my country if you are not from a wealthy family you won't have a good job and I don't wanna live a monotonous life.

But it will be impossibile, I will live a very sad life, alone, with a 9-5 work that can only give me the minimum wage to live until next salary.

Nothing’s ever enough,"By all accounts I have a lot of my life together. A master’s degree, a high stress career that doesn’t pay enough considering I often work 70 hour weeks and carry all the stress, but I’m struggling to find anything in my field that’s remote and pays the same. 

Plus, if a recession is coming, my position is about as safe as I can get, minus it killing me from stress. I just worked a 75 hour week and cried multiple times from stress. I work 9-5, then nights and weekends, and never get to leave work at work.

I’m 32 and through all of my 20s I had my own apartment, but couldn’t save anything because of rent prices. The last few years, I had the most awful neighbors of my life at two different apartments, and a roach nightmare. I couldn’t do it anymore, but I couldn’t afford a house on my own.

Then I moved into my parents’ house to save,  but I’m suffering mentally by giving up my freedom. Everything in my life feels out of control. 

And despite saving a down payment, the goal post keeps moving and prices and mortgage rates go up and up and up and I can’t keep up. It will still be years before there’s remotely any hope.

I’m extremely introverted and need alone time to function. Little things keep happening and I never get any peace between work, parents, personal life. If I could just get my own place again I think I could cope, but every time I meet a savings goal I’m still further away from being able to afford this shit because the housing market gets worse. And if I even discuss the idea of just renting again, I get screamed at by my mom and called ungrateful and stupid.

Stereotypes,Life as a black man with a small penis (6 inches) is depressing. Especially when I’ve had to turn down countless women because of my size. I finally met a girl I was comfortable with and she has been my girlfriend for a while. We got into an argument a little while ago and out of anger she said something about my penis being small. She has apologized and said she didn’t mean it but I think she just doesn’t want to hurt my feelings. Our relationship hasn’t been the same since and I’ve been thinking about ending it. I’m the only person she’s ever had sex with and she still said I was small. The only other woman I’ve been with was only oral sex and she also told multiple people I was small and that pushed me to the point where I was suicidal.

Accepting I'll probably be dead soon,"(M) (22)
Where do I begin, I spent all of my childhood dealing with trauma (now live with my dad who saved me from the abuse), have 2 failed relationships, dropped out of 2 colleges because I'm autistic and struggle with everything, being so hideous I cry alot wishing I was better looking, I eat unhealthy, lost 4 people last year 2 family members to cancer and 2 to suicide and only found out a few weeks ago 2 more of my family members have cancer, I have a diploma in computing but due to trauma I've been left with extremely shaky hands making working on computing impossible it makes me feel like a fraud. I already have attempted once with an overdose but everyday I struggle to do anything I feel like a failure to my family I almost feel like a leech knowing I'll never be able to give back everything they've given me 

Here in the UK due to a lack of funding I'm not able to get any real treatment, the last suicide hotline I vented to said to me ""what do you want me to do about it"" and when I almost made another attempt I was told ""unless you're actively bleeding, stop calling us"" or ""drink camomile tea and go for a walk"" 

Truthfully I hadn't planned on living this long and just nothing feels like it's gonna change I can't be happy about anything as once I do something always goes wrong like I mentioned with my other family with cancer

undeniably the most horrible part of my life,"turned 15 recently.

  
since it hit summer break, everyone's response is always hanging out with friends or playing games all day. I do that as well, starting from June 12th till now(it was fun) but I hate being pulled back to reality and all the things I need to face sooner after I graduate or go to college. I suffered from symptoms of autism, TICS, adhd and had vivid daydreaming as a coping method which keeps me happy and grateful the whole time and stuff like that. Mother always told me that I'm going to end up nowhere happy as her because I played videogames almost every day(I did study as well, but I hate when she yelled at me, told me to revise and told me how addicted I am. I just want to enjoy my three months worth of holidays well after stressful studies of IGCSE and exams.

maybe I couldn't live without my devices, but I just don't want to be reminded of studying for the first couple of months as I need relaxation time.

and I hate when she tells me that I'd end up begging on the streets because I hated reading actual books(I preferred fanfiction, but she despises when I use the internet to read). I don't like when she encourages me even though I already am reading other things, I absolutely despised on how I'd be brought out of my colorful world where I find escapism. Most of all, since I'm in a British school curriculum, I'd be hitting year 11 after august passes. I overthink a lot and I wonder where I'd end up in college/the future, and that thought scares me and brings me desolation since my mother tells me a lot about my life's failure if I continue my 'addiction' right now, but I simply wish to be left alone so I could turn everything all around and such. 

  
everything's just so blurry for me. I've had people give up on me because I hated studying during a period of time, and my past trauma has managed to glue myself to a screen so I could seek hope from my online friends and games or so. It's like taking drugs, but in a safer way. When the adults ask me which college I'd go, I'd be stressed due to my uncertainity and no one likes that feeling too. 

in conclusion, I wished I could've been the better child our family looks upon. Absolutely despised my mother for being mentally abusive, sometimes physically and how she let the whole family down by being jobless and not having a uni degree right now. Wished that I was actually good at maths and better in chemistry, and wished that my mother never expressed how mad she was when she realized that I hated physics.

I can't get out of bed,"After i (26m) broke up w my gf (23f), i feel like i became dysfunctional. i set a list of things i want to do in order to grow as a person like exercise, get my driver's license, excel in my job.

I was working along those things consistently for a month, it tapered off in the 2nd, before i finally lost motivation. I slumped. I spent the last month's worth of weekends rotting on my bed.

It's been 3 months since we broke up. This is really bad. My career is now struggling and it's very irresponsible of me to burden my teammates for personal reasons but i just can't function.

I think i need someone to push or coach me but realistically, I'm 26. There's no one to do that for me anymore. I'm an adult. 

I don't know how to go on. I miss her so much and i am incredibly lonely. I don't know who to seek and I don't want to go back to my old friends, after so long, just to let them hear me whine. It'll be as if i am only there when i need an emotional bolster.

I have already processed things and formed conclusions on how it wont work out if we were together and how she was not good for me. But this didn't help at all to making me miss her less, it only rationalised why i am here, not solve the pain. I also processed my shortfalls but my fear is the inability to grow from it and my current dysfunctionality is validating that fear. There are aspects in my life which were like this for a decade: where i couldn't grow in no matter how much i tried.

If this is one of those areas, I don't see anything good. I don't see how i can be fixed. It's looking very very bad. ",Friedfishies,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2ylg9/i_cant_get_out_of_bed/

Please help me understand my boyfriend’s depression,"Hi all,
this is gonna be a long post so many thanks in advance for your precious help.
I’m struggling to cope with my boyfriend’s depression as I don’t really know what’s going on in his head, therefore I don’t know what’s the best thing to do to help him and us as a couple.
So - to give you a bit of background: we’ve been together since last November; when we met and started dating we realised we weren’t just physically attracted to each other - we had lots of things in common and saw life the same way. When ok, he really is an amazing partner, very caring and supportive. I felt (and still feel) very lucky to have him. He disclosed his depression struggles to me from the beginning; he suffered from it all his life (he’s 28 now) and that is due to his bad upbringing/bad life experiences, + a feeling of being powerless to change things which are wrong in society.
When I got to know him better, I started to see his depression episodes unfolding and I also learned to see when they start as he becomes very apathetic and tells me he feels “cold and empty”. I’ve been observing the pattern and the length of these episodes varies: they may go from a few days to more serious ones which last a few weeks. During these episodes he bottles up, doesn’t go to work and neglects himself - he just lays in bed with no strength for anything; needless to say, during these times he disappears from me too and sometimes without warning (we don’t live together). When he’s ok and back to normal, he always tells me not to worry as he adores me so I should never take his illness personally - he just needs a break from everything as he can’t deal with anything. He doesn’t want to take medications and never did; I fully support this decision as I 100% agree. He simply wants to find the core reason of the problem and deal with it himself. He recently started to see a psychologist once or twice a week, but I can’t really see any improvement: some days he feels very happy and hopeful but some others (the majority of them) he’s back to his struggles. Now I know that depression is a serious disease and it may take him years to get over it, but my questions are: will he ever be able to fully recover from it, or he will have to embrace the illness all his life? Is it possible for me to get used to it and for us to have a fulfilling relationship despite this?
I’m asking you because he doesn’t want to talk too much about it with me.
Also, I tend to worry a lot when he disappears without warning, as I can’t help but questioning his feelings for me or - even worse - I start getting paranoid that he may kill himself. He told me more than once that he never feels suicidal, just apathetic so not to worry. However, I can’t help but texting him and telling him I miss him and I hope he’s ok, but I don’t usually get a reply during these episodes so I really feel left out.
As a partner, what’s the best thing to do/way to deal with him disappearing? Should I not contact him at all knowing that he will come back to me when the episode subsides?
I look forward to getting some insight from other people who struggle (or did struggle) with depression. Thank you so much!!",Staybeautiful77,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3453f/please_help_me_understand_my_boyfriends_depression/

I feel so fucking alone,Ever since 2020 I've felt more and more disconnected from society and people at school especially after what happened at home where my dad beat my mom. I feel so guilty for only making things worse for my mom and being against her instead of with her while she was being abused by my father. I feel like I've been an asshole to everyone who's ever tried to help me and I feel like sometimes I just bring misery into this world. I feel spurts of productivity sometimes but then I feel really depressed and alone. I just want someone who I feel like I can open up to and love. I just don't know if I can go to my mom as I don't feel comfortable opening up to her and I genuinely think that her life would've been better if she never met my dad and thus never had me. I've done so many awful things and I think that maybe I'm just a bad guy. I wish I was never born so then I nobody would be hurt from me and I wouldn't feel this hurt. I feel like I've caused so much pain to my mom and I just want her to be happy. I feel empty a lot of the time and things don't fulfill me like they used to. I'm not sure if things will ever get better sometimes because sometimes it feels like life is going in a loop. I feel so betrayed by my father because I loved him so much but he just kept abusing me and my mother and it hurts so much to think about how he never really loved me even though I loved him. Sometimes I envy my sister because she never had to live through any of this since she died at birth. I'm always too scared to kill myself and sometimes I feel better so it makes me hopeful but then it fluctuates a lot. I listen to ASMR sometimes but then it's just so empty when the video ends and nobody is there anymore. Thank you for reading my vent and I hope everyone here has a better life one day.

I forgot how to live a life,"I'm 16, people tells me, and people thinks that I'm just in a point of life—where I feel lost. I can't say that I'm suicidal, but I tried taking 5 paracetamols once. And tried to hang myswlf using my blanket, even though I know it won't kill me, as I know that it's not strong enough. I didn't kicked the chair, because I'm still scared even I can say that, that suicide attempt won't really work. I'm pretty lost lately—confused on how to live. I actually just enrolled myself yesterday or a day ago, and walking from home to school felt like an eternity. I actually play games on my phone and watch some animes to escape reality, and they're still working. I laugh from memes and when the scenes are kinda cute or they're just funny, which I hated. I'm currently watching a romance anime, and just finished one yesterday. But I still feel empty. I'm afraid, actually—afraid that I still need to attend school. I'm afraid that I need to live. I'm afraid that I won't be able to change to a person I want to be—someone who don't feel anything and will neither smile nor laugh nor get angry. Because I hate the part of me whose laughing too much, smiles a lot, arrogant, short tempered, and basically an idiot. I don't know what to do now. I know that I can't escape everytime, and the time that I need to face reality will come. I'm afraid to live, yet still afraid to die.

Can depression come and go throughout the day? Is it valid?,"I'm not entirely sure if questions are allowed on this sub but I'm still going to try to ask.

I know there's things like seasonal depression and stuff but I'm talking about like I might feel fine when talking with friends or when I'm ""distracted"" but then I might have a small trigger that just breaks the distraction (like accidentally being ignored or interupted or even just a small thought) and then everything just feels so depressing and sad. And I'm not saying I only feel ""happy"" when ""distracted"", I feel happy a lot but also I have suicidal idealiation and stuff and it sucks.

An example of the ""sudden depression"" thing is like, I was sitting in drama class (I'm a minor so I go to school and have drama as a subject) and in drama we sit on the floor in a circle and read our script in turns. I went to sit next to my friend and it happened to be near a girl who i guess doesn't really like me (I'm not very popular, I don't know why, I didn't do anything wrong just people don't really like me (I think people were talking about me in the class GC (which i wasnt invited to) last year because i saw my name in there a couple times) and I noticed she shuffled away a bit so she wasnt near me and I was having a great time before that but when I noticed that I kind of just went into a kind of spiral where I started to think everyone hates me (even my friends) and just had all the suicidal and SH thoughts there and everything and I just felt like shit.

"Past Regrets, Present Dissatisfaction, Future Anxiety","I'm 28, had to move back in with my parents last year, and lost my girlfriend 6 months ago. I have so many regrets from my past, like quitting two different career paths which has led me to this point of being broke. And me being broke heavily contributed to losing the woman I thought I'd marry. 

Many people will say don't worry about the past, it can't be changed. Instead focus on be future. Well, I'm going back to school and will have a career that pays 70-130k depending on where I go in the country. It's not bad money, enough to live and maybe even afford a modest home, but I'll never be wealthy from it. I'll have to save and invest and work until I'm old just to have a chance at retiring. My time will never be my own, I'll be a wage slave my whole life. I have very little hope of being happy in the future, but I'm approaching 30. I can't keep putting off a career. 

""Okay then,"" some might say. ""Just focus on the present."" How can I do so with no money, no one to love and cherish, and no hope for the future?

Seeking Advice and Support for Partner with Severe Depression and Suicidal Ideation,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m desperate for help and advice regarding my partner's severe depression. We’ve been together for 5 years, and while their depression and suicidal ideation have been mostly manageable, things have recently taken a steep downward spiral. Their suicidal thoughts are now constant, and we are in a state of crisis.

They have been switching medications, but nothing seems to be working. This has led to multiple trips to the ER, and we are desperate to find a medication that will provide some relief or at least a glimmer of hope. Unfortunately, inpatient treatment isn’t an option due to a previous terrible experience they had (the psychiatrist repeatedly forgot their prescriptions, they were exposed to other patients having meltdowns, and overall, it made things worse).

We live together, and they don’t have many friends they can lean on. I work full-time remotely, but I’m running on fumes trying to take care of them, maintain my job, and care for our pets. They have daily panic attacks and meltdowns, and I feel like I’m reaching my breaking point. Despite this, my instinct is to continue supporting them, as it feels like their life depends on me being there for them.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you cope and what steps did you take to help your partner? Any advice, resources, or just words of support would be greatly appreciated.

 Thank you. ",DepressionThrowout89,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e466vv/seeking_advice_and_support_for_partner_with/

It hurts to be awake.,"My parents just asked me if I wanted to get ice cream with them.
They came home with a grocery run, and bought shampoo for me.

I feel like a selfish person.
I get angry at myself for having even a sliver of hope that someone will pick up on my behaviour but I’m the one who pushes everything back.

I don’t want to see my therapist on Monday, it’s too embarrassing.

I’m not supposed to die before them, yet I’m staring at this rack of pills, and I haven’t even said goodbye to everyone properly yet. 

It wasn’t anyone’s fault. This wasn’t anyone’s fault. I’m the one falling short. I can’t pull myself out of this, no matter how much I try, I’m stuck in this pathetic state alone. 

The last time I was warded, my dad told me that it would crush him for me to leave him. He was down the entire time but he kept trying to smile at me. 

And after I got discharged he would make a big fuss whenever there was any sort of sharp object or pill bottle around me and hide it when I was around like I was some sort of fucking psycho. 

It feels easier to go silently than to tell them and have them try to stop me when they can’t get into my head.

Depressed parents ,"Growing up, I never witnessed my parents having fun or generally not be depressed for one time, Home was always a sad place to be and it still is. It might sound crazy but it felt like my parents had based their life on their own miserable principle that life has to be hard and sad in order to be right! Like, they preferred to be sad because they had this crazy belief that they could achieve more success by isolating themselves and only focusing on work and absolutely nothing else. I can't remember a single day that they didn't argue or had fun. Even when they did actually tried to have fun there must had been a strong reasoning behind it. They were also overprotective and never allowed me to have a normal childhood to develop social skills and such. Their behavior had such a deep impact on me that I'm still trying to recover from. The only thing that worries me the most is how they're making my brother's life hell just like they did to me but I can't find a way to help him and I feel very guilty because of this.

I’m Lost (21 M),"I have been hurting for a long time, and I have the scars to prove it. I’ve never had the sense that I was enough for anyone. In the last 2 years, I’ve undergone serious surgery, my dog and my best friend have died, and my parents are up my ass about school and my life goals. 
I’m a college student at a very prestigious university; however, recently my grades have dropped significantly. This all started after I was raped. I called my best friend that night, and she immediately came to get me. I was at a party, got too drunk, and someone took advantage of that. About 6 months later, I was rushed to the hospital as I was dying from organ failure. I was stuck in the hospital for a significant amount of time, which meant I was missing school. My parents blamed me, and told me I should watch my health in the future to avoid missing school. The next semester my best friend died, so I took about a week off of school. I took this time off because I couldn’t sleep, eat, or function as a person during this time. My parents once again blamed me, and said I should just “man up” and get through the rest of the semester. 
The past 6 months have been filled with self-loathing and anger because of everything life has done to me. I have failed out of many of my classes, which has caused me to fall behind. I now have to take a ridiculous course load over the summer to make up for my performance over the last two semesters. Sometimes, I just feel like not being here anymore is the easiest solution. Who would care anymore because my best friend is already dead. I just can’t take the awful things that have been thrown my way anymore, and I have no way of dealing with them. My parents don’t believe in mental health and I have no way of paying for therapy. 
Additionally, I feel like I lose a little chunk of myself every day. I don’t feel like I’m the genuine and kind person I once was and that makes me so sad. I don’t know how to deal with any of this anymore, and I’m scared one day I’ll have had enough.",MeasurementPerfect46,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3pr6h/im_lost_21_m/

In January, I tried to enjoy my passion for photography, forced myself to improve, and reconnected with former colleagues and friends, though one had manipulative tendencies. I saw him as a male figure, in quotes. However, every time I posted a photo, he would call me on every platform possible (at least five calls), send messages everywhere, and leave comments. It was always to ask what was happening (related to the post). As an introvert, I didn’t like it; it made me feel watched 24/7. Another mistake I made was letting someone use my identity to find a job, adding stress at the end of each month because I didn't realize it would be automatically declared. So, I decided to cut connections, and since then, nothing. But my identity is still being used. A few days ago, I asked him via message to stop using it. He replied by sending an image and then deleting it before I could see it. I still have some hope because I changed my ID a few months ago, and the one he uses expires at the end of this month.

I already know that next year I'll owe taxes as if I were rich ( I prefer he stops using my ID and I pay the taxes than say it because if I do that I can lose everything, and I would probably need to fly away that country and never come back) while earning minimum wage with 28% of my salary going to debts each month. The government believes I earned double my actual salary because 2 minimum wages = rich enough. I have no contact with anyone; I feel alone. I have small projects and passions, but I can't motivate myself to pursue them. I wish I could succeed in motivating myself, stop putting myself in danger due to my altruism, make good friends and find a girlfriend in my city, and stop having failures like the rest of my life. I wanted to see a psychiatrist; I had one session but couldn't afford more. It put me in the red, and my employer's insurance is so poor that it doesn't cover what's usually reimbursed in my country, Im waiting for my refund so I can see my psychiatrist.

Every time I'm sad or angry, I remember all the times my mother told me I was useless, that I would never achieve anything, and that she hoped I would fail in life. All the time I stayed home because going out meant spending money for her. All the times I refused to go out with friends because I would be harassed on my phone ten minutes later, being told it was time to come home. Every time one of her acquaintances died, it was my fault. She even told me twice that I was worse than an accident worse than an unwanted, the worst thing that ever happened to her, and that she wished I had never existed. I knew I wasn't wanted but it was hard to hear that as a child, she bought me girls' stuff even though I am a boy. Ironically, she doesn’t like homosexuals! At one point, I believed I was a girl born in a boy's body(10\~\~14y). Around 15y, I started playing online games and met the group I cut off contact with last year. I desperately searched for a way to be loved, a way to forget, like adults drowning their sorrows in alcohol, but for me, it was in games.

I remember around 10 or 11, I wanted to end it. A friend at the time saw me and stopped me. Sometimes I think she shouldn't have intervened.

At 18, I left the country. After that, my mother would tell me she loved me and all, but she always had to remind me in every call that it was my fault for this, my fault for that. She also mentioned who would take care of her once she is too old (actually she is 66y) I suppose it will be my older brother (M38). My mother always called me by my brother’s name. I know she rarely called my brother by my name, but for me, it was all the time. My brother and I didn’t live together much; he lived with his father, and his life has also been pretty bad, but at least he is stronger than I am. And anyway, our last text was fine and you, fine thanks (mom and I).

My adult life has been socially challenging. I’ve made some good friends (they live abroad), but I know it has directly impacted my adult life.

In 2021, I hit a shallow point and played with a knife, wanting to stab myself but couldn't do it. I promised myself that if I couldn't improve my life by 30, I would end it all. I don't see the point of living if it’s only to continue being rejected everywhere, never succeeding in anything, and being alone.

Kinda wish I was dead.,I hate being alive. Everything I do is a fuck up. I feel like I'm only still alive because I have things in my calendar and I'm too much of a people pleaser. Whatever works I guess.,Lumpy-Firefighter856,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4f2ht/kinda_wish_i_was_dead/
Sleeping on the train tracks tonight. ,"This is it. I won't be a coward again. I've been fighting for 15 years and nothing ever changed. Every single fucking day is worse than the last. I can't do this anymore.     
     
I've been diagnosed with severe depression, ADHD and Asperger's for 3 years now. I grew up in a torn and abusive household and was bullied ever since kindergarten.      
      
I've tried so damn hard for so damn long and just get beat up for it. I really just wanted to be loved. But live wouldn't even give me that. I'm so sick of this bullshit. I'm not even close to being an adult and the only fucking thing I know is pain.    
   

I wanted to die since I was a child. Honestly, I never understood why I should all of this work and effort into something I never even asked for. Just waking up every morning and coming to terms with the fact that I am actually alive, conscious and present in this world is painful on a level I can't express.   
    
I don't want this, and I never did. Life's always been nothing but a slow, boring and painful process that ultimately leads to nothing in my eyes. Every day is just a copy of the last.
     
There are no words that could convey the hatred I have for this place, for myself and everything around me. Simply being alive makes me so fucking angry. I want to die the most brutal and agonizing death I can, just to know what real pain feels like.       
        
I've never done anything for a reason. I made every choice in my life on a whim, just because I felt like it. I've done the most depraved things to myself, just for the sake of doing ANYTHING.      
         
All my therapists already gave up on me. I'm only 15 and already have been told multiple times what a hopeless case I am. I made others spiral into depression, just by talking about how I view life. I genuinely believe that I'd do the world a favor by dying.    
    
I don't deserve to be loved. I'm a thief, a liar and an addict. It's fucking pathetic. Just looking in the mirror makes me want to die.     
      
It doesn't fucking matter what I do, I always end up here, crying on the shoulders of strangers and begging for help and attention even though I don't even know what's wrong with me.    
    
      
I'm completely numb by now. Everything stopped helping. Not even drugs can make me feel good.       
         
I'm not playing this fucking game anymore.

"I hate me, life &amp; everything else","my life has always been shit. everyone always told me that it'll get better someday but that never happened. I just hate my life so much, I hate myself, my environment and everything else too. I'm 20 (f) and have been depressed since I was 14, have very bad social anxiety ever since I could remember &amp; to top it off I am autistic. 

these days, the only thing that really makes me happy is smoking weed &amp; occasionally taking other drugs. I've just started a new job &amp; even though I'm proud of myself for finally doing something with my life (I graduated 3 years ago) I hate myself for being so stupid and anxious at work. I lay in bed all day, scrolling on tik tok or instagram, distracting myself from living. I don't have any friends &amp; I do have a boyfriend, but I'm not that happy when I'm with him either. besides work I don't do ANYTHING and it's frustrating me because I can't get myself to do anything. why am I so lazy?? I'm literally burnt out from doing nothing all day. I have a gym membership but I never go cause my anxiety is just way too high. 

I do hate my body &amp; I wish I could bring myself to go to the gym, but I don't eat enough. I even hate eating, it feels like a chore and nothing that I enjoy anymore. I hate how I look, especially my body, since I don't really eat much I'm way too thin and almost look sick. I've spent such a long time trying to love myself, at one point I just decided to give up. I feel like I am so ugly &amp; even though people tell me that I'm not, I'm so self conscious of myself. I feel like even how I'm walking is wrong, I hate my posture and my teeth, I hate how I dress &amp; I don't have any money to buy myself nice things. I compare myself to so many beautiful women online &amp; know that I'll never be happy with my looks. 
it doesn't matter how many times I change my hair, change my make up, my personality, I still always end up hating myself. 

I also have a pretty sad home life. both of my parents don't work, growing up we never had any money &amp; sometimes there wasn't even enough money for food. I have 5 siblings, 2 of whom I don't speak to. my parents have a lot of debt, even making debt in my name. as a child I also saw the police at home often, since my father did a lot of illegal things. at home it's always dirty, since my mom never cleans &amp; my siblings don't really care either. I'm the only one who's always cleaning, but I don't get appreciated &amp; I don't want to tidy up anymore. I would do anything to get out of here since I also have to share a room with my 2 sisters, but I don't have enough money. 

I don't have any hobbies, I hate everything and I regret not killing myself when I was 16 and still had the guts to do it. now I'm just slowly rotting away day by day. I wake up nauseous every day due to my anxiety, I've had sleeping problems since forever and I also have migraines almost everyday. I feel like my body will give up on its own slowly. 

I've tried finding my way to god, but I didn't feel better. I even tried manifestation and spirituality but nothing fucking works. I've tried waking up early, sleeping 8 hours or 4 hours is no difference, everyday I wake up tired of life. I want to go outside when I'm inside &amp; I always want to go home when I'm outside. I don't belong anywhere, I don't know who I am. everyday I look into the mirror and don't know who I'm looking at, it's like I'm a stranger to myself. I lost my teenage years to depression &amp; now I'm 20 and will never get those years back. I don't even know why I'm writing this right now, or if anyone will even read through this, but I just feel so alone and like life is a chore. 
maybe I should start therapy, but where I life it's impossible to find a therapist. I just want to life like everyone else, I don't want to be me anymore. I live in a constant state of stress, but I can't even cry anymore, I haven't cried in months even though I'm so miserable. 

I don't want to die, but I feel like I don't belong here. I feel like an outsider &amp; my autism only makes it harder for me to live. when I'll die someday, I hope everyone regrets how they treated me.

I just examined my life,"Imy 78yo.
1- Due to a radical Proctectomy 27 years ago I was made impudent. About a yesr year later my wife left me for a man who is a 5 count felon and just got out of prison. She met him while we were doing a prison ministry. 
2- as a result of the surgery and radiation treatment for that cancer a permanent side effect was chronic diarrhea. 
3- I had a relationship with a lady that had MS. I pay all her bills. Cooked our food and did the household chores. I found out she was having an affair. So that ended in 2000 
4- 4 years ago I had a stroke. Although my family was very supportive I have five kids I chose to live in an assisted living facility. I also have to use a walker. I met a lady my age not realizing she was an avoidant. I went through love bombing till this relationship (?) ended.  Nice thing about assisted-living is almost everybody wears diapers. 
5- this year I lost bladder control. Between being totally incontinent and having to take usually 2 to 3 showers a day just to get clean and wet wipes don’t work with diarrhea.

The point of this is that I am totally incontinent, impudent, require a walker. 
   Oh I failed to mention during this past 4 years I’ve grown a beer, being totally incontinent and having to take usually 2 to 3 showers a day just to get clean and wet wipes don’t work with diarrhea. Also while living here I’ve added beer belly and tits so I’m very  unattractive

I don’t wanna be here anymore(long story),"There’s just too much pain for me to handle. I feel I either die or go insane.There have been good moments in my life but im constantly reliving the bad.It started off when I was living in Georgia. My mom had got on drugs really bad when I was 4 years old and my sister was 6.I remember her and my dad always arguing bc of it.Waking up to mom holding a knife towards dad and then screaming at each other.It was every day and every night. Along with living in a bad environment constantly getting robbed,my parents allowed a homeless guy to live with us for a while and he would lock me and my sister in a room and beat us and cover my mouth. Just alot of bad shit. Until one night my dad had enough and I remember vividly him laying with me and my sister and telling us we were leaving in the morning to Kentucky to live with my grandparents.So the next morning we woke up,threw a bunch of shit in the car and left my mom.I can remember her chasing behind us and screaming not to leave. But my dad thought that would be the best thing to do for our lives. So we made it to ky and I met my grandparents. My grandpa was my dad and uncles step dad and my mamaw was their real mom. When we first got there it took a long time to warm up. My grandpa and grandma had to drag me and my sister out of the corner and I remember just screaming I hate you and I want to kill you and I didn’t even know them.so grandpa made me pick a switch. They were very strict.Eventually we warmed up to them and settled in.Dad stayed with us there. Not long after being there my dad had decided to take me and my sister to his friends down the road and they were all drinking and playing guitar. Having a good time. Til we all eventually headed outside on the porch and in the yard. Me and my sister stayed on the porch and was hitting a punching bag. And this is where the trauma in my life got worse. Nathan. My dads friend was very drunk and I remember him walking outside with his eyes closed with a shotgun barrel to his head. Faced towards me and my sister. And boom. I remember it all. My dad tried to calm us down and say that he accidentally shot himself in the leg. But that wasn’t true. He had killed himself right in front of us.A couple months pass since that and my mom starts calling my dad saying she’s off of everything and she’s doing better. So my dad tells me and my sister he is gonna be gone for a couple of days to pick mom up. I remember hugging him balling my eyes out saying please don’t leave please don’t leave.But he had to.But then a couple days go by and he’s not back. Papaw and mamaw say he’s spending time with our mom for a while. We were extremely sad but figured we would see him again. But no. December 13,2009. My Dad had picked my mom up and on the way back got into a fatal crash and died. My mom survived. The time we thought he was staying with mom in Georgia he was actually in a coma for 6 months.The day my grandpa told me he had picked me up from daycare and my sister from school. He said there was good news and bad news. He told us to choose one or the other. We both chose good news. He said our mom is back. But wouldn’t tell us the bad news until we got home. Where my family was in the living room crying because they found out about him dying and so did we. My mother had to pull me away from the casket.She stayed for a week after the funeral. Then one morning me and sissy woke up and she wasn’t here. She had abandoned us without even saying goodbye. So now my mom is back in Georgia. On drugs even worse and me and my sister are living with my grandparents.Fast forward 3 years. Im around 8 years old my sister is 10-11.We have already been through hell but that wasn’t all.I remember I was taking a shower cleaning myself. And when I get out I hear the door sling open. It’s my grandpa. I grab a towel and try to cover my body and hes just pulling it out of my hands trying to reveal me. He had a camera. He took multiple pictures of me naked and scared. And I’d rather not know what happened with them. He also molested my sister in many different ways. We didn’t realize what he had done until we got older. I was 13 and my sister brought up something he had done and it made me realize what he did to me. So we both decided to tell my uncle. My uncle told us not to confront him or anything and seemed like he believed us. The next day at school I told my cousin Audrey about it and she started balling here eyes out and it had gotten around to the office. Eventually I’m called to the office and one of my aunts are there to pick me up. She looks angry. As soon as I get in the car she asked me very irritated “What have you and Emma been making up about my Dad? We were in middle school and she instantly shut us down. My grandpa called us crazy the family believed it  and sent my sister off to an institution and when she got back my grandpa had molested her again and I backed down completely and said it was all a lie on my part because I thought they wouldn’t love me anymore and I wouldn’t have a family.My grandma had cancer during this time and died in 2013. The whole thing had blown over not long after and we were pretty much silenced.My sister came back eventually but always snuck out and tried to find ways to not be there. So it was Me my sister and papaw. Until my sister was 18 then she was out of there. So it was just me and my grandpa.And my mind had completely tuned out everything I guess for the best to keep my sanity and not kill him.I stayed with him as his health got worse and he had gotten dementia and his liver was failing. He started forgetting everything and defecating in the floors and I had to keep a baby monitor beside him in his room and one in mine. My aunts would sometimes come check on him and ask me how he was doing and they had me take care of him and clean him up and everything.He eventually got to the point he was stuck in a hospital bed in the living room right where my grandma passed. His days did not go on much longer and I got on pills in this part of my life so it was all just a bad time. He died not long after.So I moved into my aunt and uncles but ran away and stayed at a friends the majority of the time. Sissy had her own place now and gave birth to my nephew a couple years later. I was 17 atm. My mind Was and is now in a darker place. I don’t talk to any of my aunts and uncles anymore because of our past. I am now 20 and 4 months Ago my biggest nightmare became a reality. March 25th my sister is struck by a truck right down the road from her house and Died from the impact. She was texting me 3 days before on how she doesn’t want to be here anymore. And it was just a couple weeks after she had my other nephew. She was 22 years old and suffered most of those years from the things we witnessed together. My best friend and only person who could completely understand me. She got hit in the middle of the day and it hasn’t been announced if it was an accident or not yet. The people left are the ones who silenced us and our mom who abandoned us. Which I just recently moved her down here because she doesn’t have a car and she’s addicted pretty bad. It sucks that after all these years she can be here after my sister dies but I’m still the one that had to bring her here or it wouldn’t have happened . I have chosen to forgive her even though it’s hard. But everyone in my blood seems to get taken away tragically(my full blood aunt was also hit by a car in Georgia) and I fear death is coming after me next. So while I’m here I want to be the bigger person before I go. I think of suicide a lot and it has gotten worse. But I am getting into psychiatric care here soon and I hope that might help. Either way I’m going insane and wish that me and my sister could have at least had a chance and wasnt mentally messed up from the start.Im trying not to bring destruction all around me from being so broken. I know it’s a lot to read but I wanted to be heard from somewhere. If anybody has any advice for me please let me know.

Need advice or support ,"This is kinda a vent post but I do want support to help.
I'm currently at the hospital with a sister in law having a baby. Her whole family is her and their friends. My husband's family is very conservative and they always jab at us for being alternative / emo etc. (Also I'm sad I can't have a child right due to finances  now had a miscarriageast year around this time) so I'm on edge I guess. Trying to not cry. But I'm sitting here in the waiting room and I say to my husband's mom, ""I hope they let us babysit when she is more grown I'd love to."" They look at me like wtf no. I instantly try not to cry...

Then I'm talking about how if I have a kid I'd try to get on all fours because that's better and easier for the women, it's a more natural position than laying on your back.

A family friends goes, ""omg if you have a child it be like the exorcist""

Like wtf does that mean?
That I'd scream and cry cause yes I would obviously anyone should.
Or that I'd have a demon baby cause they are mad I'm not Christian conservative. 

Either way I'm triggered in many ways and I'm trying to stay cool, meanwhile my husband is sitting there unaware to any of the slights against us. ",Dull_Rest77,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4coph/need_advice_or_support/

I cang continue like this but i actually dont want to die,"I don't have the same experience as a lot of people I see on here. Nothing very bad has happened to me since I was a teenager, and I'm 26 now. I'm married, I'm at the end of a 5 year apprenticeship, my parents have sought therapy and apologized, my siblings and I all love each other, and my friends care for me so much. I have two cats who I would give anything for. My wife is beautiful and kind and loving and deserves so much more than me, and than this. I have a great therapist and I'm on medications that usually work. I have great health insurance and a pension for retirement. 

Despite it all, every day I think about dying. It's like when things were rough, I broke something within myself and now I think about suicide every day. I think about how not existing would be worth the pain, and how no matter what I do to repair my life, I can't fix how broken I am deep inside. 

Last year I went to the mental hospital. I spent a week inpatient. Something new broke in me there, when I watched my wife cry and panic every day trying to figure out what to do. When I heard my dad and mom calmly and carefully encouraging me to get better over the phone. Not only have I become broken beyond repair, but I've broken them too through this process. I have done irreparable damage that I can never take back. 

I don't want to break anybody or anything again. I can't live with the guilt and constant hollow aching anymore.

"Can excessive porn use cause someone to look at content that is not aligned to their innate sexual orientation? If they do this, are they no longer able to be their innate orientation?","I’m not a troll this is genuinely what I’ve been going through the past 2 years.

I’m nearly 18 and 2 years ago when I was 16 I was in a really bad place. I was depressed and isolated myself in my room every single day for nearly the whole year. I was dealing with other issues at the time which led to this. I had been watching porn 1-2 times a day since I was 10  but when I isolated myself it went up to 2-3 times a day. I always knew I was straight and never thought differently. I have seen gay porn and trans porn before and it doesn’t turn me on at all as I don’t like it.

When I was depressed and watched a lot of porn, I ended up looking at pictures of a feminine looking man that was in a bikini and had surgery to look like a woman. There was no nudity involved and I was only focusing on the butt nothing else. I did this a few more times over the next few months (probably only another 5 times within 3-4 months). 

After the last time, the regret suddenly sunk in and since then I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and honestly I hate myself for doing this stuff.

I’m not trying to be homophobic. I just always knew I was straight. Since I realised my actions, I look at the pictures to see if I’m still aroused by them, but each time I am disgusted by them.

I feel straight again and I honestly do not ever desire to look at those pictures ever again, but I also feel like I am unable to be straight again after the actions I had done in the past.

Is it possible for me to be straight like I was before? I genuinely do not have any desire to do it again and I regret it so much. I’ve been suicidal for nearly two years I just can’t cope with what I had done.

I’m not trolling or anything I’m being genuine.

I tried to say something, calling her out on the crappy things she’s done but she just went off about how she’s such a “bad mother,” stuff like she’s gonna kill herself and how ungrateful I am.

I've been depressed for 6 years and i'm tired enough to think it's gonna get better anymore,"It all started on august 2018 when summer holiday ended and school started once again. I started feeling really weird, i was sad and didn't feel the strength to do anything.
There was this one day I laid in bed for 17 hours straight doing nothing and didn't eat for multiple days. I also were bullied in school and didnt have any friends and my parents were fighting almost everyday (They also abused me and my siblings when we were younger because my father was drinking a lot and depressed at the time). So I couldn't really tell my parents if I was feeling sad or if I had any other problems. That's just when I stopped doing homework at all and my grades were going downhill though I still managed to pass the classes which is quite impressive.

Feeling awful,"I am reposting from r/breakups because I’m not even sure how appropriate it was for that sub.

We broke up on Monday after a year of a pretty terrible relationship. Constantly unmet needs and bare minimum requests unmet which triggered a lot of fights and nothing ever being done about it. He called me and told me I made him want to die and told me to fuck off and leave him alone. 

After a year and a half I finally quit my job that was exhausting me and leaving me feeling burnt out, most of the colleagues that I worked with in that time didn’t really care and some seemingly pointedly didn’t say goodbye on my last day. 

I don’t have many friends. Feel pretty insecure and like it’s difficult to connect with people but hang on to a sliver of hope that most of the time that’s something we tell ourselves out of insecurity. 

My family doesn’t ask anything about my life and treats me like a child, sent my mother a picture of my last day at work and she ignored it. Just feel like it would be easier if I was just dead. I feel so alone and like I’m not worth saving, like there’s no good part of me to hold on to. And to top it all off because I’m 26 I feel like I’m too old to be dealing with these immature/petty things or feelings. Feel like something is very wrong with me.

I'm not sure what to do anymore,"I'm 29, and have been diagnosed with BPD since 2017. So every day is already a mental fight with myself. I recently had to move back in with my mom (and her mom) since living on my own is just too expensive in this economy. I was hesitant since the reason I moved out was her fighting, screaming, and hitting me a few years ago. It started off fine and calm but these past few months have gotten worse like they use to. She claims it's my fault her and her mother fights, that I don't do anything she ask me to do, even though I do, and she snaps back with a ""not without bitching."" She screams at me over the smallest things, screams at the dogs, screams at her mother and it's just too much now at this point. And when she blames me, I rebuttal with ""maybe I should just kill myself"" and she replys back ""maybe you should.""

Drained. ,"Exhausted beyond comprehension. For as long as I can remember life hasn’t felt worth living. I don’t know how I got to this point. I just remember one day in 6th grade instead of feeling insanely anxious, and paranoid and constantly freaked out and cautious from everything around me I began to instead not feel anything at all. I went numb and I’ve been numb ever since. I was 12 at the time I believe, and I’m now 18 and although you could argue that it’s only been 6 years those 6 years have consisted of the majority of my life where I’m ACTUALLY conscious. I don’t know where I’m going and neither do I know where I want to go. I live a comfortable life, I have a loving family, I have two parents, I graduated with honors, I have people who love and care for me, I’m going off to college in the fall for biochemistry. I have so much going for me, there’s so much life to live so much to experience but if I’m being honest with myself I don’t care. 

Will life ever get better? Will I spend the rest of my days enduring a bleak life? Will I ever get that one thing that I’ve realized that I’m missing within me but the rest of the world seems to have? Am I normal? Am I abnormal? Am I good? Am I bad? Should I live? Should I die? What do I do? I wish I knew I genuinely wish I knew.

I want to get better but it seems impossible. Im tired of pretending I’m so tired of it. I’ve gone most of my life pretending im fine but I don’t know if I have it in me anymore. I don’t think I want death but I definitely don’t want this life either. Nothing feels worth it anymore, crying does nothing for me anymore and I’ve come to realize that crying fixes nothing. I never feel relieved after I cry in fact I always just feel worse. I try so hard to ignore how miserable I am everyday. I try to pretend that there isn’t a parasite living within my brain and soul that is sucking the life out of me slowly day by day. 

I need help but asking for help has never worked in the past. I wish it would all just end in a second. I don’t care for myself, I don’t care to acknowledge all the small beautiful things in life, I don’t care for anything. I live day by day simply getting by. How it is I’m still alive is beyond my own understanding.

Help…I don’t want to be like this…,"I’ve realized over the past few months that I have kinda withdrawn myself. I think I know why and this makes me feel weak or inconsiderate of my friends. I feel like I’m only thinking of myself bc I will just act like I’m busy and text then instead or say “I can’t hang” when I can, I just “can’t”.

I have recently found that after spending time talking to or hanging with my friends I feel bad and they literally haven’t done anything…so now I  
don’t trust that the conversations from my friends will keep me in a good headspace. Sometimes even them asking me “how I’m doing” makes me reflect on how I’m NOT doing good…and they mean well….but even little questions like that can sometimes make me spiral….

They are aware of my diagnosis of depression and I’m sure they could tell LONG before my diagnosis so they try to make sure I’m ok.  But even with that sometimes I feel guilty bc they “have” to be mindful…sometimes I wonder why they don’t just give up and let me be, it’s not what I want but I don’t feel like I don’t deserve their effort…I just feel bad bc I don’t reciprocate the same effort if I’m being honest.

i am unemployed and not schooling at the moment - i've taken a gap year, i was in high school when covid hit and finished my last years from my bedroom, where i have practically been almost every day since for the last three or four years. i am terrified to head into college with all these functional adults, and i've been suicidal since i was eight years old, and i never planned to make it to this age. this all means that i have no idea what to pursue in college, no idea what life i want to try and live. with the rise of AI creatives, i have been completely displaced in my (former) dreams of pursuing something artistic, though i'm fully aware that art hardly makes money, and that my skill does not exceed anyone's - i bring nothing to the table to make me worth looking at over AI anyway. 

as previous stated, i am essentially bed-bound - i've been trying to make more plans to get out of the house, but i can't drive and must rely on my only friend to come pick me up to get me from point A to point B, i do not make any money to pay back the gas that they spend, i am a burden and quite useless in this regard, and it fuels my idea that everyone in my life would be much better without me leeching off of them.

some issues that don't need much elaboration is that: i am overweight, i likely have PCOS (and may have possible fertility issues, i never wanted kids but to have the ability deprived from me when my body is already useless makes me so upset), i am a person of color, i am not very likable, i am unattractive, apart of the lgbtq+ community, i'm not very smart, i haven't achieved anything, i am a financial burden, an emotional burden, all of my hobbies that could potentially generate income - i am mediocre/subpar at, i struggle with a porn and masturbation addiction that i feel horrific about, through all of this, i have come to realize that i have *no* redeeming qualities that make me worth taking up the space that i do. i've tried accepting this fact, but i absolutely can't, because i am surrounded by people and social media that constantly reminds me that the people around me are so much better.

all this said, as a very brief **tl;dr, i have no redeeming qualities to make up for the space that i take up and for the burden that i am, and it's eating away at me.**

i'm still learning how to be an adult, like everyone my age, but *worse*, because i am horrifically behind the curve, with parents that coddle(d) me into adulthood, i am overly reliant and can only front for non-family to make it seem like i have my shit together, when i clearly don't. i think that at 20, i've definitely hit the limit for being like this and i feel the need to relieve everyone.",dayluto,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3ecyc/i_wish_to_relieve_those_that_i_burden/
What's the point of living?,"First of all, I am not suicidal nor do I want to die, this is a genuine question.

6-18 years, school

18- \~60 years, work

And once you're old and your best and fittest years have passed, then you get the time to enjoy life. I don't know if it's even worth it, to live. I am currently on my way to become a chef, and move to out. Overall my life is heading in a really great direction, but I just hate the thought of the future. Every day, just waking up, working and sleeping, and a bit of weekend sprinkled in.

It just seems so pointless to me. Maybe I'm just going through a typical 16 year old's doomer phase or something and I'll have a brighter outlook on life sometime in the future but right now, I can't see why one's time in this world is concidered so precious and I never got a clear answer from anybody, all I ever got was either a ""Life is beautiful"" or ""You'll see out that life is beautiful"".

I just wanna know if there is even a point to my existance in today's world if my entire purpose is to work my good years away, and then die.

Dumped. #gay #heartbreak ,Male 35 have had a boyfriend for 6 years. 5 weeks ago he dumped me. Basically… he asked me to come to McDonald’s I genuinely believed it was a mini date 😐 I know … classy 🤦‍♂️ so I pick him up we go to the drive through and he has “forgotten” his wallet. Fine I pay and after he gets his food he tells me it’s over. He has arranged a “sure thing” with another guy for a weeks time so he was dumping me before he goes and moves on right away with him. 😐 and I’ve to drop him home. On the run up to this he had made all these promises that we were going to go away together and blew it off for one reason or another. I literally spend hundreds trying to organise different trips. A side note here is this guy is also my best friend. Like our lives are intertwined. So the plan was we would still be friends but I don’t believe he has any intention of actually being my friend. I still love him but rn I’m literally ready to take my own life. I feel broken that I’ll never love anyone like I love him. He basically has my heart still and I feel so empty. He is supposed to be my best friend too so when you are this hurt you lean on your best friend but this guy has become so selfish over night that I feel so alone. It’s been 5 weeks now and I just want to die and never feel this pain. Idk why I’m reaching out on this I have no hope. ,Fireman2213,53,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4rvvt/dumped_gay_heartbreak/

Life sucks then you die. ,"I don’t see myself not being lonely and depressed. 

I’m 24 with a college degree in history looking for a paraprofessional job so I can get my master and be a teacher. Right now I’m in summer and I’ve been out of high school for 6 years. I work at Wendy’s and the para jobs are not calling back. My mental health is horrible. I smoke weed to mask the pain and depression. I have absolutely no one except family. I want a girlfriend but nope I can’t find one anywhere. I broke up eight years ago my only girlfriend and she found a boyfriend and she has been going out with him for a long time now and I’m just stuck going to work and fishing and hanging with my dogs. I feel left out of everything. I’m always the second choice or whatever. My phone is always dry. My “friend group” really isn’t my friend group. I haven’t texted them in MONTHS and I have not heard a peep at all. Like I always have to text first. I never ever fucking fit in to any group. I’m always a fucking outcast. I get paid shit money. My Wilke family get paid more then me and I have a fucking degree. My dad and sister don’t. Like what the fuck is wrong with my life. I hate life. I have so much fucking debt. I can’t afford shit. I just needed to vent. If you have any tips I would love to hear them because I’m lost as fuck and lonely as hell. No one ever like my fb post. I never get any matches. My family even outcast me sometimes. Like my sister graduated high school and no one thought to think to get me to take pictures. I was out of the group. Like life sucks. I hate it. I’m always forgotten in the conversation like people don’t listen to what I say. I really hate life. I have no friends. I text first all the time. I don’t know why I’m hated. I hate myself.

Is this a sign I might kill myself? 17F,"I usually don’t plan my suicide attempts. When I have attempted in the past it’s always for the most part been a spur of the moment thing. I am always depressed and suicidal but I push through until it gets to much. These past few months my depression has been worse than ever. I’ve recently attempted suicide. I feel like if I attempt again it’ll be over for me.

I’m an actor and I’ve recently been accepted to a really big project for my standards. The biggest I’ve ever done. And I have the most lines and everything. I’m was really excited but the past few days I’ve not been. And even though it’s 100% gonna happen I’ve been finding myself going “if I do the project” instead of “when”. A part of me feels like maybe I won’t. And today I got the script. Usually I’m so excited to read the whole script and I learn my lines straight away and usually have a lot of it learned in a few hours. I’ve only skim read through it and even though I want to read it all and learn my lines I don’t have any motivation to at all.

Even though this is the biggest role I’ve ever done and I’ve never experienced this before. I think maybe this is a sign my depression is getting worse. Maybe part of me knows I’m not going to make it till the show.

I have no joy in my life.,"For the past 5 years of my life, I feel like there’s a pit of sadness that doesn’t go away. I may feel momentary joy, but that quickly turns into stress and anxiety. There isn’t a single part of my life that I can consider happy. I feel like an outcast within my own “friends” some of whom barely bother listening to what goes on in my mind. I even feel like an outcast within my own family. They see me as someone who’s just lazy, always asleep, or always in a bad mood. For years I didn’t bother telling people what was wrong until recently. That only made it worse. Talking to my sister and my parents I realized this feeling is never going away because even they seem to try to understand nor care about the pressing feeling in my chest. I’ve thought about taking my own life before, but I always knew that I’d never do it. As time has gone on, the thought becomes less and less terrifying. Knowing that this is what the rest of my life will be like makes me fear that one day the feeling will grow so strong that I just off myself. What’s there to stop me? I know that the pain of losing a loved one goes away, and someone like me taking their own life would be an incredibly easy loss to swallow. I feel burdened with my own existence. I don’t see my life ever becoming something worth living. Maybe leaving this will help, maybe it won’t, but it feels like every passing day of my life brings me closer to my last.

I can’t bring myself to care about my future,"i’m an upcoming senior. I have my last opportunity to take the SAT and get a decent score in a month. I have college applications to start. I have to find colleges and recommendations. 

I can’t bring myself to do what i want to do though.

I was diagnosed with moderate depression and GAD (general anxiety disorder) about a year ago. I went on Fluoxetine for about a week and then stopped. I was supposed to stay on it for a few months and go up in potency depending on how i felt but i ran out and since the pharmacist didn’t have the refills i just stopped.  

I used to think that my doctor was over exaggerating my symptoms and i didn’t have “moderate depression”. But i realized the medicine did help a few weeks later when i no longer felt the effects of it. But i didn’t think it was important enough to get more. Probably a bad idea.

Anyways, i used to study for the SAT like a maniac. Seriously. And i improved well but you know what they say about how the higher your score goes the harder it is to improve. Maybe it’s not as difficult and I’m just making it seem like it is to make more excuses for myself. Went from PSAT 1130 average to a 1350. Ik it’s not as great as some people but it’s something. 

My first SAT i got a 1340 and then bs’ed my way for a couple months swearing “doing my best studying” when me and my entire family knew i wasn’t. It went up 10 points and i lost the meager energy i had left to study. 

Nowadays, i spend my time lazing around with nothing better to do. I sleep at terrible hours, wake up nearing the evening and do nothing but eat, nap, and scroll on my phone for entertainment. Don’t shower for days. Avoid meeting people. I tell myself i need to study since my last exam is coming up. 

I know that with a higher score i could get a better scholarship and save tons of money for my parents considering tuition. I want that. I don’t want to make them pay for an expensive college all out of pocket because they are determined to not take out loans or let me work a job whilst pursuing higher education.

I love my parents. With everything i have. But no matter how much my older brother tells me i have to care about my future and focus and study- I fail myself.  He’s doing it out of worry and precaution for me because he knows i won’t think about it for a second if nobody reminded me to actually put my mind to action. 

But i’m so so ashamed and guilty for how i constantly let them down. Everytime i sit down and try to put my plans to action, i half-ass it and know it won’t account for anything.

I’m not particularly suicidal or anything but i do have intrusive thoughts (which im pretty confident everyone has in their lifetime). But i think perhaps one of the reasons im so unprepared for my future is because i for some reason always assumed that i’d die due to some sort of accident or illness (not sure why, it’s just been like that) before i had to make such decisions. 

I have thoughts that go such as:

Someone: “(Name) you have to think about where you’d like to go to college”

*It’s not like i’ll live to go anyway*

Someone: “College is a big thing in your life and you’ll never get that part of your life back”

 *We’re kind of all just specks on a rock in outer space i don’t think it matters that much what i do in life*

^^Basically stuff like that. I don’t intend to kill myself or self harm in any sort of ways so i don’t exactly understand the deal with thinking i’ll die super well. In fact i look forward to the idea of marrying someone i love and having a great family with them. That is, if i find someone who’ll love me enough to want to marry me.

I’m thinking of asking my dad to get me an appointment or whatever it is that i need to do to get back on the medication in hopes it’ll make me happy enough to enjoy the idea of putting in the work to study and purse a better score with all the benefits?

Sometimes the shame and guilt eats me alive so much that it chips away at me in random times of the day. Sometimes all i can do to force myself to sleep to avoid the pain it’s giving me. Sometimes i just want to cry for the rest of my day. Or sometimes i just don’t care enough to think about it again. I’ll tell you what, the later is **quite** rare.

This seems like a vent, but i genuinely do want advice.",Remarkable_Badger153,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4gy6u/i_cant_bring_myself_to_care_about_my_future/

Something that’s been on my mind recently,"I’m so tired of people. I’m of feeling alone and isolated from the people around me. The way they act is just so cold and almost automated. Like my family just treats me as normal as if I’m not a unique person as I see all of them. When I see problems they just look at things and say, “we’ll figure it out.” But never do. When I come home from work and no one says a word but will sit sound the dinner table and laugh and cut up for 2-3 hours. There been days where a slept almost all day until I had to go to work and no one checked up on me. There’s been weekends where I lost it in my room and I had breakdowns and panic attacks from just life and no one knew about it because no one bothered to every check up on me. Even though I check up on them all the time. Just to talk to them. I once attempted and though it failed, I was miserable for a month, I wore a jacket for obvious reasons but no one noticed or even asked about how I was doing. I would look at them sometimes for a solid 2 minutes just waiting for them to say something. But they never did. Whenever I go to them, they are always responsive but never reciprocate. Whenever someone else needs something or just wants to talk or hangout everyone is always there. They’ll invite people over or go places and just be as happy as can be. But yet I’m stuck here, in my room, in my mind wondering why all these years, I was treated as nonexistent. My friends are the same way. The friends I’ve had for 7+ years now. Sometimes we all get together and drink. In the last year or so, because how bad I’ve gotten, I always just hit it too hard. They would ask me why im drinking like a maniac. And of course in the beginning I would just say it helps or it’s been a rough month. Sooner or later they realized it was more when a rough month become the 12-13 rough months. Yet they always just acted as normal and never really bothered to check on me. Whenever we would talk and I would try to ask for help or tell them what’s going on they just tell me how good they’re doing or they would start hanging out without me and complain that I was bringing down the mood. They once told me they all had a hangout that I couldn’t be there for and collectively they told me I was the glue of the group, like the leader and who everyone looked up to, it felt good and I loved them for it. But now it’s like they moved on from me and don’t really care. Now instead of opening up when we drink I just lash out or make comments and they always ask why do I pull away and not share myself. Why do I not reach out if I really need them. I normally don’t say anything but it’s the same with my family. Im always there for them and I’ve always helped out but when I need something they seem to not be around. Like when(fake names for privacy reasons) Jared said he was hurting because his ex had passed away I was there to help him through it. I talked to him and helped him grieve. Or when Zach had family problems and I would give him advice and even come over and mediate talks with his mom. Or Sheen when he just had bad anxiety and I would come over and hang out with him, sooner or later they all worked through their problems or found solutions and im just left sitting here wondering when it’ll be my turn. When do I get to reach out and get help. You know who was there for me, my best friend in middle school who ended up taking his own life. One of my exes who I stayed closed with who O.D.ed. My best fucking friend in the whole wide world who lost to a disease. Among everything else that has happened in my life every-time I’ve needed the people I’m supposed to trust and care about, they always fall short no matter how good I am to them. I don’t like to talk about the dark things I have going about once when we all got wasted, we got into really heavy topics and I told them I really wanted to commit and they just said, “Aw man, don’t do that. Just live. Just do that instead.” At this point it’s not a matter of the stereotypical, I can’t take it, there’s nothing left for me. It’s the fact that I’ve come to my own personal realization that the world I came into doesn’t give 2 shits about me, the people around me have just pushed me out and don’t care about me, and the only place left that isn’t horrid and has people who want me to be are on the other side.

Like why create a meaning for myself when my own opinions keep changing and evolving. It feels like I don't have a strong foundation. 

Life just feels like it isn't worth the trouble. I don't dislike my life but I do feel like I'm slowly dying or being poisoned by the life I do lead. I'm not saying my life is bad, I just don't see the reason for keeping going. My mental health is bad enough that I really just think I shouldn't exist and I've felt some version of this for years.

My bf got strong suicidal attempt(he’s breaking with me for this…*,"What should i do if my bf got strong suicidal attempt?

I’ve been dating him for a while and things always go fast and smooth between us, i can say everything is going quite well so far, and we just past the first month of our relationship.

Technically speaking, he’s the very first serious partner in my life and i cherish this relationship a lot, we love each other a lot too.

He told me from the start that he got some mental issues, so yes he has drug problems but nothing like addict, i know it can relieve him sometimes but i hope i can help him to gradually quit this.

At first, he always said things to me like “baby u are legit the only reason that i wouldn’t kill myself” or “i wanna try to quit drugs for u”, i was quite touched and motivated, i sort of wanted to *save* him, i know it’s stupid though but i still feel like so.

A big problem in this relationship is that, most of the time we have to do long distance, his hometown is close to me but not where he does uni right now.

So last time when we saw each other, we spent 4 days together, there was this night where everything was so good, vibe was alright, until he told me maybe we need to face reality of long distanceand other things.

I’ve always been an insecure person and when he kept emphasizing *reality* i bursted out crying and i ended up crying for almost an hour, out of breath. But he was too, there was this moment that he can’t help himself so he escaped to the bathroom just so i wouldn’t see him crying out loud. But i did hear it, of how he was out of breath like me.

From this i know at least we really love each other and i also told him that i really want us to work out.

But today, he texted him quite a bit less than before so i asked him if everything’s alright, he said he’s hungover and tired. And he said he’s worried about me, for being too attached to him that if one day he leaves me i’d be too traumatized and even ruin my own life. So he’s trying to let me withdraw. He also said things like he think he would *eventually kill himself* because of all those issues, and they are getting worse every year and he doesn’t know if he can handle it.

I cried again, but instead this time i couldn’t cry in his arms and feel his firm hugs, and everything of this relationship suddenly feels like time bomb right now.

I feel so sad thinking about all these beautiful things have barely started but i already have to prepare to be losing them, it really breaks my heart.

I tried to put myself into his shoes, i know i can’t help him because it’s actually not about me but himself. He does love me, so he wants me to be less sad if bad things really happen one day.

I really don’t know what to do right now. Unlike other crisis, this one makes me feel really weak, and my heart hurts everytime just by thinking about it.

All i ask for right now, is that he can live on long as he can, even if he loves someone else after me, even if we couldn’t be together.

Btw, at this moment, i am still waiting for his good night. Please.",PoppyAlbaPulcherie,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e356ok/my_bf_got_strong_suicidal_attempthes_breaking/

I am planning on ending things.,"I thought it would be tonight. But I'm not ready. Are we ever? I guess the reason is... how do I leave those who love me? Would it be better to just start pushing them away slowly? I'm already in an Isolatative state. My loved ones seem to be fine with that.

My sister is having her first baby and as much as I'm happy and excited to be an aunt, she is moving to another country and doesn't seem to have any plans to have me very involved before she goes. She prefers her SIL who is more IG worthy. I've also been told I won't be blessed as the godmother (even though she is my sons). So, I feel like minimizing contact slowly would be easy.

My mother would be hard but somewhat easy.  She loves me very much but doesn't notice my absence for days. She usually prefers to just talk about herself and interests. Even when she asks for updates or what I'm watching I'm met with ""Anyway..."" almost immediately. 

My son would be the hardest. Since he's 19 and lives with me. But he is at the age where he only wants to focus on his friends. Should I keep encouraging time away from home with his friends and less time with me? He already thinks it's annoying when I ask him to hang out with me. 

My brother barely talks to me just because he's busy doing his own thing. But he's always seemed to have my sister's back more when it comes to us having boy trouble. He was at my sister's side when her ex cheated on her, but when I was raped he didn't even reach out. 

My friends have their own stuff going on and one of my best friends have already benched me in her life after she got married. She had her own new best friend and never includes me in anything. I think she's my best friend and I'm not hers really. My other best friend would be devastated so I think pushing her away would be best?  So it doesn't hurt her as much. She already has so much going on at home. My other close friend... only ever invites our other friend out and never me. She calls me her daughter's chose aunt but wouldn't even introduce me to her. ( I'm really good and safe with kids). She invited me to her daughter's party and seemed disappointed I showed up. She could have been busy with hosting though. So again, slowly disappearing might not be a bad idea. Right? 

I just... I just feel so invisible and worthless. My hobbies I love don't bring any sort of spark. Growing up all my friends abandoned even into adulthood. I've been abused, physically, emotionally, financially and sexually by different partners. I've been told I'm only good enough for one thing in relationships. 

People who are supposed to live have told me I'm too quiet, too pale, too dark, too skinny, too fat, too outspoken, too crazy, too angry, too sensitive, too heartless ""Why aren't you socializing?"" ""God, you were being too flirty? You're such an attention seeker"" 

""What happened to the light in your eyes? It's gone?"" - my sister

Sorry for the rant... I have ADHD ugh! I just want these thoughts to stop haunting my head. 

I can't do this anymore. I just want it to be over. I posted in another sub... but I guess... my main question is... would it be better if I start pushing everyone away?

Suicide Coping,Weirdly I’ve been able to cope with my suicidal ideation by fixating on it. Just comforting to think this life is one trigger pull away. They tell you not to dwell on negative impulses but I find it helps to imagine finally going through with it. I can take a bad day because I already know what the barrel of a 9mm tastes like.

My self esteem issues have gotten way worse.,"A few days ago I made a post speaking about my life this year, included there was the fact I was broken up with recently. 

For some context, early into the relationship there was a moment where he expressed how non-attractive I was to him, my skin color/race (I don't believe he's racist, I just think he doesn't find my race's features attractive.), my weight, even my hair, it wasn't at all his type, so despite my best efforts, he wouldn't return any physical affection. I know I should've seen this as a massive red flag and probably ended the relationship there, but I didn't, I was head over heels for him. 

I've never had a great self esteem, I often see myself as lesser, as non-important, as expendable. Post my breakup however, those voices have gotten louder and louder, and now I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror without feeling like a disgusting looking freak, so much so that I've actually teared up from looking at my own reflection, and included in this, I've become starved for physical validation.. to be found attractive by someone else.. I want to be loved and be told I'm not what my head tells me I am, be given the validation my head won't give me and my ex surely didn't.. 

I know that looks are temporary and all but, I can't help but give it a lot of importance, I just want to feel like I'm not going to wind up alone because of how hideous I am..",InspectorFun3080,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2xov7/my_self_esteem_issues_have_gotten_way_worse/

I really hate myself, if i looked like the guys in the back of the class or the dudes i hang with, i know they would of never even looked at me. And the one girl who did like me, i went and message one of the girls who used me. I remember she would smile not to make me comfortable, or to show she was having fun or to influence me in anyway, but because she was genuinely happy to be with me. And i went behind her back and she got with her ex gf 2 months later.

Struggling to Relax – Will Antidepressants Help?,"I'm 37 years old, and for the past 5 years, I've had trouble fully relaxing. I don't experience panic attacks or severe stress, but I'm constantly in a slight state of tension and mild anxiety, which is really draining. I've always believed that fear is a strong motivator, and over these past 5 years, I've accomplished more than ever before. I completely gave up alcohol, saved enough to buy an apartment, paid off my car, started a second small business, maintained stable earnings, and improved my cardio fitness. However, I'm now mentally exhausted, experiencing depressive episodes, struggling to get out of bed, and withdrawing from social life.

I want to be able to relax again like I did when I was 24, to worry less while still being motivated to achieve new goals.

My question is, will antidepressants help me care less and restore that relaxed state? I'm afraid that if I start taking these medications, I'll become lazy and lose my drive. In the past, when I was around 20-25, I took SSRIs, but they caused significant mood swings.",WolverineTop2936,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e44on8/struggling_to_relax_will_antidepressants_help/

But is it bad to be hurt over something? I know I behave badly and rudely. I am cold and heartless sometimes. But I also sacrifice, I also do little things out of love. 

I can't say that or express it cause if not, I am just asking for credit and I don't see what they have done for me. Which I am not saying they didn't. I am just presenting my side of the story and when I defend myself they get angry and justify themselves more.

I trusted them, they have broken it many times. And I have too. This all is making me feel suicidal. I have come this far and faced many hardships before too.

But sometimes you know, I wish one of my attempts were successful. It was for a reason I was trying to die. Now I have too many reasons to live for, I have wasted my parents money too much and I have made them have hope. 

I wish I didn't give them that, I really want to die. Unlike in my last attempts. Right now I have access to tall buildings, can buy medicines I can overdose, I can hang myself without interruption for hours but I can't die even if I wanted to, I have to pay back all the favours and money only then I can die, which isn't for years.

You can't escape violence cause it will be inflected upon you one way or the other. I wish you tried harder to kill yourself. Once upon a time I tried to fight those thoughts and the ppl who told me that, it's ironic that I am gonna tell myself that again.

I can’t work and my treatment is dragging their feet on helping me get disability. There are some days where I can’t even get myself out of bed and I just piss in a bottle. and I’m not even overweight. I’m just around 200 pounds.  And it’s different for me because most of my life I weighed 160.. I’m stuck in a house with smokers and it doesn’t help my asthma, but it’s literally the only place I could go without being on the street.

I don’t like a cop out there times I’ve sat for hours at a time trying to think myself out of my depression. There’s been so many times I’ve told myself OK this is what the situation is. I just need to accept that and find something good about it and no matter how many times I try and do that I end up back at square one. Feel like I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know.

I mix and I live in a town that pretty racist. Not to mention everybody in this house things the lgbt is an agenda and gossips behind each others backs. I wanna get away from it all but idk how, and I’m burnt out on hope there’s no more hope left in me.. I’m just kinda here, I’m not suicidal I’m just stuck.. I feel powerless, I feel like life controls me and I have no control. I hate that I want control, I hate that I can’t be content but this isn’t some way to live. My only hope is low income housing and to find a low hours job while I wait for help with my SSI. I can’t do things on my own and nobody is helping me fast enough to get to a safe place.. I’m doing everything on my end to show up and reach out.

I give up,"I know heartbreak isn’t a reason to end it but I’ve never felt more alone than right now. I lost the love of my life and am left with even more trauma than I have the space to carry. My entire support system is gone because I’ve pushed them all away either because they have feelings for me or because I feel like a burden for being so depressed all the time. My only friend is the person my ex cheated on me with and I feel bad for burdening him too. I think he’s only friends with me out of guilt for the situation. I’ve attempted in the past but those who cared for me always stepped in. Now that I’m alone, I feel like I can do it with minimal heartache to anyone else. I know it will hurt my ex and my one friend, but I can’t keep fighting and I think they would understand. I finally have the opportunity to do it without hurting anyone. I recently attempted while on the phone with my friend but he started crying and calling out my name begging me not to and it stopped me. It hurt so badly to hear him hurt because of me but I hurt all the time now and I’m burdening everyone else with my hurt. I won’t tell him I’m doing it this time. He can’t stop what he doesn’t know. So before I go, I want to say I’ve tried everything I could to feel better. Nothing is working. Not drugs or alcohol or self harm or self help literature or talking to friends and family or nature walks or going on drives. Everything is grey. I’m tired and empty and I give up.

I told them i wanted to get divorced, they took the cats and moved in with their family. Last thing I’m waiting for is the house. Which is in like two weeks. 

Then I can take all my stuff to goodwill or throw it away. Then I can write a letter explaining myself. Explaining that living is too much and i’ve literally spent half my life wanting to die.

Then I can be free to kill myself finally. I picked a method, just need to work out the details.

Weight problems,"I have some kind of eating disorder. I'm stuck in a binge restric cycle and I can't stop fucking eating.
I'm not even having one too many slices of pizza while out with friends. I'm just eating bread and honey and mayonaise or some shit.
It's honestly so depressing.

I haven't been able to weigh myself but I can tell I've gone up and I feel disgusting and inflamed and puffy and horrible.

If I regain more weight I don't know what will become of me. I genuinely think my only option might be suicide if I can't get this under control.

I've worked so hard. I've committed my whole life to reaching my goal weight (still not there yet) and now I'm watching myself destroy it all.

I have a session with a specialist tomorrow.
I'll probably be fine until then. It's not like I even have access to supplies.

I am so tired of everything.,"Like the title says, I’m so tired of everything. Being depressed fucking sucks. I feel like I don’t have anyone in my life that would listen and take me seriously when I’m talking about my problems. My mum just says you are 23, how can you be depressed when you didn’t even experience life! There will be harder times that just a heartbreak! There are people that have cancer or people that are homeless! You can be lucky to have a roof over your head! How can you not be happy? Don’t you fucking think I don’t know that? Then one day it gets better and I’m laughing, and suddenly everybody thinks I’m okay. Cuz you can’t laugh when you are depressed right?

When I tell my family about wanting to off myself no one takes me seriously either. But I’m so tired of living, I can’t even picture myself when the hard things come, when I can’t even handle a fucking breakup and some school stress. I feel like I’m not made for life. I’m too weak for this all. 

It’s so nice outside but all I do is lie in bed and cry all day. I would love to go outside and go on some adventures, it’s summer break over all. But I have no one. My best friend is working all the time and when she’s not, she’s with her bf. And I don’t have any other friends like that. So I’m just a fucking loser that does nothing all day. I’m so jealous of people I see on instagram going on a vacation and just having fun. 

I hate this generation. All we do is scroll social media, and that fucks us up. We are all pushed to go to university, make more and more and more money, buy a house that will bankrupt you, be hot, workout or you will not reach today’s beauty standards.

Looking for advice: is it over for me?,"Hi all,

I seriously considered suicide at 18, but I figured I still had time to turn things around and I believed ppl when they said things will get better. Well, 4 years has passed and I’m in no better position now. During these four years I focused heavily on self improvement, including learning (for myself), grades(for school), and exercise. I didn’t go out to parties/clubs at all because I barely made any social connections throughout college. As such, I have no happy memories throughout these last four years. 

I have good grades, am in great shape, and I feel generally satisfied with the knowledge I know. My problem is that none of this helped me in my life. I have little work experience and as such I have no prospects for work. Initially I wanted to go to law school, but I realize now that despite putting so much effort into learning I am only above average at best in my intellect, and I can’t score very high on my LSAT despite working an ungodly amount of hours on studying for it. Because I can’t score high on my LSAT I can’t go to a good law school. My grades are splendid, but it turns out grades are not worth much in applying for grad school or getting a job. 

I have no friends and am developmentally behind in communicating with my peers, I developed a terrible stutter, and I don’t know how to socialize anymore. Recently I tried to put myself out there and talk to ppl, but they try to get rid of me as a friend as soon as possible. I have no friends now. Of course I have no romantic experience and no hope in ever getting into any romantic relationship because of my two problems above. I have been on dating apps for around three months, and nobody that I like is interested in me, and my standards are very low. Throughout my life I must have been rejected by 300+ girls online and around 10 in person, I was never ‘accepted’ (whatever the opposite of rejection is) by any. I consider myself pretty chill and I’m not some misogynistic lunatic or sex crazed deviant. And this is despite maxing everything I can in my personal life. Lastly, by reading so much philosophy I developed a value change, and I cannot connect to people because of it.

TLDR So I guess my question is when is it logical to call it quits. I have no career, romantic, or community prospects. Compared to 4 yrs ago I improved everything that was in my control, but I did not improve in any of the three fields I mentioned. Instead, now I have other problems I wasn’t struggling with before, namely being developmentally behind and having different values.

"My vacation has been amazing, the only time ive ever been truly happy, I can’t go back","My whole life I’ve constantly suffered, the past 3 days have been clearly the best in my whole life, 0 competition.

I used to have hope but I no longer have hope for the future as I get older. I don’t care that I’m young (22) I don’t want to live in this society that we’ve created.

I wish I had died after my childhood was over.,"I had a pretty nice and comfortable childhood. And even then I knew that my adulthood would be godawful. Lo and behold I was completely right. Almost every adult with anything to say would tell me adulthood is constant stress from five thousand directions. If anything they were sugarcoating it.

If only I had killed myself before adulthood started I would've avoided so much headache. The only redeemable thing about it has been the occasional sex and drugs. Other than that, adulthood is nothing but making and spending money and being stressed out. Now I am in deeper than ever before, and even more damage will be done if I ever choose to end all that noise. Maybe the worst part of it is that the one real choice I have that's mine, the choice to kill myself, can't even be carried out with dignity or peace. 

Hopefully I'll either find the courage to end the cycle, or get killed randomly.

I can’t get a job and I’ve been having suicidal ideations,"My problem is simple: I recently graduated from college, and every day I’m increasingly convinced that my life will never amount to the kind I hoped I’d have. Every day I believe more strongly that I’ll never find a good job. Rejection after rejection is proving to me what I’ve always believed deep down: this world has no use for me. I feel like I’ll never contribute anything meaningful to society because I’m not as smart, charismatic, good-looking, physically fit, or wealthy as so many other people out there who are far more qualified than I am to have or do anything that I could ever want for myself. There are men out there who are taller, smarter, more athletic, wealthier, and kinder than I am, so my worth in society is objectively low, as is the likelihood that I will find a satisfying job that meets my absurdly high expectations for life. There are people more deserving of my life and the life I want than I am.

If it weren’t for the possibility of hurting my family, I think I’d just do it. I’ve always thought about how people would react to my death, and while I think my friends would move on unscathed given enough time, I feel immensely guilty for just thinking about doing something that would hurt my family so deeply. Then again, I’d rather them remember me as I am right now than watch me devolve into the complete and utter failure that I fear I’m becoming.

Today I'm 28 and I can say with no shadow of a doubt that I trew down the drain my 20's I had bouts of depression and ideations would come from time to time. Aditionally I expirienced some depersonalization at times and a very bad period of obbsesive compulsive thoughts that wrecked me.

I left myself be dragged by my own life, I had relathionship that meant the world to me, I can see how if I got any better it was because of her, she made me keep going. But wasn't as happy as she should and left, I don't blame her, she put up with so much shit from me. She did enough.

I'm back at square 0 only this time dragged by the worst mental health I ever had in my life and I'm lonelier than ever since, unlike in the past, now I have someone I miss like hell.

Her loss made me loose my shit, I didn't / don't recognize myself, I tried to do better, did all the shit I was told to do, ALL of the stupid things they tell you to do, I did. Not going to lie I shortly felt better, wich wasn't difficult given the state I was in a few months ago but I never felt alright. Eventually I went back to being a mess.

I'm a crying mess at home, at work, when I shower, when I drive, when I wake up or go to sleep. I lost 22 pounds, I feel weak, snacks are 3/4 of my diet, I've got nightmares, I feel hopeless etc  I'm not detached enough to not see how this is really concerning. I almost end things on march 27, had several intense mental breackdowns, the ideations were crazy but they calmed down until last month when they started to get out of hand again, but different this time.

They used to make me feel scared and desperate now it almost comes with a sense of acceptance. They come I see them and it's like if it were normal. I often catch myself imagining how the scene would look like, I searched how to do it safely, if I see smt that could make it happen I register it in my head.

The night of saturday I drove to the abandoned train station of my village, I sat down with a drink and snaks in front of the tracks at night several hours registering at what times the trains pass. As I sat down against an old wall I thought of death, things I lost and sobbed, the roar of the train against the rails, the vibration on the floor and up to my body and the strong air flow they cause passing by had a total different feeling that night.

I'm really worried, this is not fucking normal. Aditionally I'm scared for the people around me and the emotional impact I would cause on them. It would be very shitty of my part to let them know.",Gregory_Gp,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3qhhn/im_worried_the_idea_of_dying_seems_to_be_settling/

I 33f am married to 37m
We have a little one.

We have been together 11 years.

In the beginning it was great, I was happy, I was in love.

Shortly after having our daughter I developed pretty bad PPD and tried to get help but the meds just made me worse.

We moved far away from family and I was left alone dealing with PPD and an infant 16 hours a day, every day.

During this time living across the country from family, he abused me. It was only the one time, but it’s stayed with me ever since. 

Fast forward to today and I have basically been raising “our” child alone for the past 8 years. I work, but I also do all the work of a SAHM. My child even comes to work with me (which I am grateful was even an option as childcare is not cheap so this was a financial relief.)

I have chronic depression. My earliest memory of me having depression I was 4.
I also over the years developed anxiety and CPTSD from sexual assault.
I go to a trauma therapist and yes it’s working, but I have a lot to work through. My husband knows this and yet provides me no help or relief from my every day tasks.

I cook dinner, he does not. So the trade was he’s to do dishes. They’ll sit in the sink for days, and if I complain, I’m the asshole.

Suddenly our child has started having bouts of severe anxiety and it’s been hard to handle as I cannot get through to her to help her. 
I set up both a doctors appointment and therapy for her. Again, with no input or help from my husband.

Last night as soon as it was bedtime my child started having bad anxiety.
Now I also have a chronic illness that causes me to be in full body pain and aches pretty much 24/7 and it makes me exhausted.  
So when she started I myself started to break down.

I have so much on my shoulders. I do everything for my child, husband, our pets, the home, and I put myself last because I have no other choice.

I got up and went to get my laundry and saw that the stuff I just treated myself to was covered in black ink from a pen my husband left in his pants. And I lost it. It was the straw that broke the camels back.

I had a full on mental break and panic attack.

My husband’s way of consoling me?
“Knock it off and stop fucking up her (out daughter) life!”

I couldn’t believe it. I could not believe he said that to me. After everything I have done and sacrificed for him and our family.
(And for context my daughter is absolutely attached at the hip to me, not him.) it was one of the most hurtful things he’s ever said to me, especially since he knows that with my own mental health I already feel I’m a POS mom for being depressed 24/7

I don’t want to be alive anymore, but I also can’t do that to my baby. The guilt comes in heavy with the mere idea of offing myself because of how often my husband has called me selfish for even having those thoughts as a parent.

I know I of course didn’t give you our full history, but that’s the gist of our relationship. I have retaliated against his words and actions towards me and he knows exactly what to do to gaslight me into insanity.

I want to just leave and start a new life and be in a better head space with my baby, but I financially don’t know how I’d even do that. I also have no family to turn to.

I am stuck and I am depressed to the point of a numbing disassociation.

I don’t know what to do.  ",Crazy_Thanks,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3stm4/lost/

It’s back,"I am currently 28 and have struggled with the darkness and suicidal thoughts since I was 6.. that’s the earliest snippet of memory in life I have. I thought about jumping out a window. Home was never home. It was abusive.. neglectful and not a very good place. I don’t have many memories of childhood besides maybe a few short snippets of certain situations. In my teens.. I’ve come to realize I was groomed a lot.. I let older men take advantage of me so that I felt wanted. It was mostly online. But at 17 I let a man SA me and I was happy about it I guess.. he was 30 and I was just happy someone wanted me and liked me. At 18 my first time was not my choice I was held to the ground and then held and was told “I love you” so I thought it couldn’t be that if he loves me. Now looking back on the past I’ve seen how much I’ve never had a say in what happened with my partners and I was never asked for consent ever. But I never said no.. I just wanted them to like me. Now I’m 28, single.. and I’ve been working so hard to heal and heal the generational trauma that was handed down to me. I am the fixer, the healer, the nurturer. So that no one has to ever go through hardships like I did. Now.. now yes I am suicidal daily.. but lately.. well more so recently.. at least 3 months now. I’ve cried myself to sleep, or just don’t sleep until my body finally gives out.. I am also having health issues, my liver is having issues.. and I have to go get checked for breast cancer as well.. at this point I am feeling very worthless and done. I see no light. I’m a mom.. my son is the most wonderful soul and being a mom is the best thing to ever happen in my life. I am also currently in college.. but I’m dropping my classes due to my health and mental stuff. I can’t keep up with it all, I’m exhausted. I don’t have a job. So I feel useless even more so now.

"I should off myself, out of dignity. Because I am useless.","Yeah, I should off myself out of dignity, to avoid any more humiliation. I am not someone who excels at anything, and in fact, I kind of suck at everything I do.

I am useless. So much so that I consider myself, and I can objectively vouch for such a point of view, a waste of resources. I lack the necessary skills in a vast repertoire of aspect to succeed in life and have a deserving life; social skills, practical skills, professional skills.

I suck at every game I've ever bought or pirated. It's not just the competitive shooters, but just about every game. I suck at every hobby I have. I want to be a writer and future author, but my writing skills are subpar to every and all published and unpublished author; I cannot read a fucking book even if my life depended on it. Why? Inattentiveness. ADHD-ridden brain. I cannot focus on any one thing at a time without feeling exhausted or bored.  
I suck at the classes I have in university. I am not the best student, or amongst the top. Fucking Christ, I am still studying in the same university for FOUR FUCKING YEARS and I just barely completed 25% of the program. KILL ME ALREADY. I suck at every single fucking social interaction I have. I'm friends with nobody, and when I'm partially allowed to exist within a friend circle, I'll be the wall nobody wants to speak to.

I suck at drawing, I suck a writing, I suck at gaming, I suck at socializing, I suck at learning, I suck at speaking, I suck at everything I do. I cannot even lose weight even if I wanted to. I decrease the food intake, increase water consumption, and yet I'm still as fat as I was years ago. Yeah, I'm not obese, but any kilogram above the ideal lean body is a death sentence if you want to have a partner.  
Oh, yeah, I also have no gf. Why would I? Other depressive people are depressed but HAVE WORTH. Other people may have ADHD, but they get super creative endeavours that make them desirable. What am I? A waste. Useless.

I guess when I was bullied and told I was mentally retarded, those bullies were right. I am mentally retarded.

I have not a single thing I'm good at. I don't mean ""the best amongst my peers"", but ""good enough that I'm happy with myself"". No.

Maybe, then, it is imperative to kill myself and avoid any further humiliation. When you're young, you're full of potential (or so people think of you); always at the brim to explode with a million creative ideas, and distil one or two into productive, long-life goals that will catapult you into a proper, deserving, well-lived life. But once you hit a certain age, around your early to mid 20s, people will wonder where is your potential.

Oh, you don't have potential. You're too broken to have potential. You are useless.

So I think to myself, this is enough. I want to die with dignity, both to myself and for others. I want to die early so I stop this ongoing humiliation of being utterly useless at everything I can or could do. I'll never be a good writer and author, I'll never be a good artist, I'll never finish my degree, I'll never be good at any game, I'll never have a girlfriend who loves me, I'll never be happy.

People, this is not a depression-rushed conclusion to my problems, but a natural outcome of a life full of failures. A man has only so much he can endure, and if I do not see any improvement whatsoever after being alive for 23 years, then I can safely and accurately conclude that this life is not worth continuing.

I fear my depression will be the end of my marriage,"TL:DR: I think my depression is seen as an inconvenience to husband and I’m constantly scared he will leave me if I’m not happy wife facade 

TW: sibling loss, suicide

Me (28F) and my husband (30M) have been married for seven years. A lot happens in that time. Good, bad, ugly. Overall I feel our relationship is straight out of a love story. There’s always going to be bumps in relationships but we’ve always been able to eventually communicate and fix anything that’s not quite working 

Well last year, I lost a sibling unexpectedly to suicide. Not sure how many people have experienced grief on top of regular ole depression but suffice it to say it has been rough. A rollercoaster of emotions and everyday being different. I feel we’ve navigated it as best we could and overall my husband has been supportive. 

Lately my own depression has gotten very bad. Like not leave my bed, loss of appetite bad. And I feel my husband doesn’t understand. I don’t feel like I’m given any grace during this time period. And I really don’t think he does it from a malicious place I just don’t think he understands severe mental health issues or how best to support someone. Which I get. I don’t expect him to be my therapist. But I do expect him to be a support system for me and I just don’t feel that. 

I don’t know if I’m just in my own head or what but it really feels like my depressive episodes are inconveniences to him. For example, past 48 hours have been awful. Something not done by either of us pushed me over the edge and every feeling came spilling out. Including how dark my thoughts are right now. I mean very concerning thoughts. I think it caught him off guard and I just went to bed. Today we tried to watch tv and I dragged myself out of bed to do so. I was snort laughing which happens sometimes and it felt so good to feel the little glimpses of joy that are so rare. He told me to stop because the sound was stressing me out. Knowing and seeing that I hadn’t smiled in two fucking days. 

I blew up at him and he tried to backtrack by saying he thought I was choking or something (obvious lie and doesn’t want to own up) 

And it just got me thinking about how I don’t feel like I can turn to him to support. And that my mental health will always be an annoyance to him. And I’m so scared he will leave me if I let myself fall to deep into these feelings. 

Idk what to do. I can’t imagine life without him I love him more than anything. but I’m finding myself even more depressed over the fact that I’m basically alone in this struggle. 

How do I have a successful relationship with someone when I’m in such a dark place. What can I tell him to do to be supportive. Idk how to navigate this 

FWIW, I am medicated and try to do a lot of things at home to keep my mental health good. haven’t gone to therapy as I moved states and finding a new one sucks.

"I don't deserve my dad, or anyone","
My father has been a very important person to me. He has been a single parent ever since my mother became obsessed with money to the point she turned to drugs and cheated on my father. I have been aware of my dad's struggles to keep the family together, worse now he is in his 60's with my brother with no job.

Now me, an extremely ungrateful son. I take everything for granted even though I believe otherwise. I always get what I wanted, from a new phone to a new PC. But at the end, I forget my dad is a person too. I always reply to him monotonously as if he is not my dad, speaking in a way like I want him gone and just not bother me anyone. I only say thank you when I got what I wanted, I rarely say love you to him. I tried spending time with him because you never know when he's gone but I never did. 

Few hours ago, my dad unlocked my door with a key and asked me if I ate already, I said I already did and to not use the key anymore and just at least knock in a disrespectful tone. I wish I could have said that differently to be honest. He lashed out and said he noticed how disrespectful I have been lately and that he gave everything to me even though he has been struggling at work as a single parent. I couldn't say anything but stare at him from my bed. After that he just slammed my door and left me feeling extremely guilty to the point I intent to k*ll myself that moment, I have constant thoughts of relieving the burden of being a spoiled brat. I grabbed my belt from my closet and tied it to a somewhat n*ose to hang it on a door and hang myself with. I thought of all the things that could happen if I ended it here right now. It could take a while for everyone to grieve, but the burden of having to put up to my shit is not there anymore. It felt like a win for everyone. But the thought of the pain made me hesitate, so I just went to self harm, sliding a small but sharp thread cutter along my arms. It felt liberating, to physically punish myself because no one will. 

Lately I've been struggling mentally, I starved myself as a form of punishment, even self harm. I wanted to run away from everyone, start a new life, a chance to change my disgusting behavior. But I'm still an upcoming college student, (19) no job, barely any savings. Why is it hard for me to accept that I'm extremely fucking lucky to have this life? Why do I have to bring others down? When I see my friends bond with their family, I always get so jealous even though I'm the problem. I really love my dad, but I can't seem to show it or act it.

I don't blame anyone but myself, so why is it hard for me to change my shitty self?

Back to square one,"I was doing so good for maybe a year. I had moved out on my own, got a car, had a job that I somewhat enjoyed. Now a year later, it’s going to shit. The same job I’ve had for two years is fucking me over. 2 shifts this week but the plumbing went out. So I got about 4.5 hours instead of 12. Then this next schedule, 3 shifts. I’m fucked. My hours had been slowly ripped from me. It was 6 then 5 then 4 and now 2 or 3. Everything I’ve worked hard for, budgeted for, skipped hanging out with friends when I’m 21 and young and should be having fun but I wanted to be responsible. I have never bought anything crazy. I haven’t gotten myself clothes in over a year. I rent an apartment. I got the cheapest car for the payments. I tried so hard. And for something that isn’t even my fault, it’s gonna go away. It’s all gonna be gone. My little safe haven of an apartment. My shitty car that took me to and from work. I’m gonna have to give my dog up. And what makes it worse, is my older sister makes the schedule. She knows I’m already struggling. She gave my hours to her bf. He has 5 days a week and has been a manager for like 1.5 months. I called up my other sister, wanting to day drink. Her phone is off so I’m alone in my apartment drinking. The thought of taking my pain pills from my surgery a few months back has crossed my mind a few times. I’d rather die than lose all of my progress. I’m already negative in my bank account.

Looking for encouragement ,"I’ve been having a really really bad year. First the wife left me in debt and penny-less, had my small business shut down when it was really successful, had to work 70 hour weeks and three jobs all year and feel totally destroyed, lost my health care and am uninsured, I had my car totaled recently and my parents kept saying if you need help we will help you financially but I’m very independent and said I’d only ask for help if I absolutely needed it badly. Well for the first time in my life I really need help desperately because of the car accident. So I ask for 2k, I really need more but that would make it possible to survive this crisis….. they said no, they spent all their money on amazon junk. I feel so humiliated and mislead. For the record they completely take care of my brother financially, bought him a car two years ago and let him still stay rent free after 32 years while I’ve been supporting myself since 18 when I moved out and put myself through school working 3 jobs.

Last months, maybe years women have made my mental health worse and worse and one time my limit will be reached. They have choosen to ignore me for 23 years and now my conclusion is that going on with life is useless and I will have to take things in my own hand and commit suicide. I am so angry and frustrated at the moment and I am not happy that women forced to do this. When I was young I was thinking life would be great but now I know that its the opposite. My parents knew that getting a girlfriend would be difficult, and yet they did nothing about it.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do.,"I'm 17, from Turkey and I just dont know what will make me happy. I have a roof atop my head, a cozy bed and food and water. If I say I was sad it would be shameful wouldnt it? Millions of people over the world are much poorer than I am, they are in the middle of wars they don't even have anything to do with, many people have shitty parents, live in shitty places, have no friends, are oppressed, yet they still try holding on to life, they still work hard to live and stay alive. They try brushing off their problems and continue their lives.

And we have me, complaining about some bullshit. Do I even have the right to complain? I should be disgusted at myself for even thinking of a possibilty of suicide. How can I do that while there are millions who are in worse conditions than me right? And my parents, they have fed me and took care of me for my whole life and going away without returning anything would be disrespectful to them right? Or is it already their fault for bringing me to this world. Maybe I shouldnt feel indebted to them because they wanted to make another child because of their selfishness and them wanting another kid and nobody asked me my opinion about being born. So they are supposed to take care of me and feed me, because they themselves wanted to make a child so its their duty to do so right? I honestly don't know which one I should feel. I guess my brother wasnt enough for them though, I know that at least.

I have lots of friends, they are all good people, but not even a SINGLE one of them will accept me for who I really am. I don't even know what I am by the way. I am certain of a few things though. I was born into a male body. I know that I like my hair long, and I like having bangs, I like learning about makeup, I like feminine clothing, I know that I hate my masculine body, I hate my body hair, I hate my thick eyebrows that most of my guy friends envy, I hate that I'm as tall as I am, and I know that I feel that something just isn't right. Am I trans? I don't know, maybe I am. But who cares about the labels, I just know that I want to live the way I want to. My friends though? They aren't willing to accept me. No way am I EVER going to open up. Most of my friends are Muslims, even those that aren't, they hate everything related to lgbtq+. I was an hypocrite when one of my closest friends was proudly talking to me about burning a rainbow flag in the street. and I laughed at it. I have no place in the lgbtq+ community because I am not proud about who I am. I can't proudly defend my real thoughts, and I'm supposed to live up to my father and friends' expectations of being some big muscular dominant male or some shit. It's been 13 months since I started going to the gym. I'm stronger than most of those friends. They respect me. But what if they knew that deep down I wanted to keep my hair down, and learn more about makeup? Why do they care even? It's my body isn't it.

Hormone therapy? Maybe hitting up a psychologist? Or a therapist? I don't know how to. I don't know about any of these things. I know that I am not opening up to my parents about any of this. Forget gender, but I am not even saying a single word about having symptoms of clinical depression. I was the hypocrite who laughed and agreed with my father when he proclaimed that depression is some bullshit created by the west to disrupt our progression. I thought my brother was more sane. He says that Turkey is a country bound by its customs and religion. He says that he supports lgbtq+, religious freedom, he says he wants to change how the country is. Yesterday, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. I got tired of hating myself and suddenly losing all joy whenever I looked at my reflection, in the phone, in the mirror, wherever and whatever. I watched some videos, grabbed a scissor, and cut some tall bangs to cover my large forehead and my receding hairline (at this age, I know). I got out of the bathroom, my brother saw me, he started laughing. ""What, u transitioning or something?"" ""You look like a girl, its awful."". Yeah, they are all supportive of modernising or whatever unless it comes to someone they know. My mother is probably like that also. I am not gonna open up to anyone I know, like, ever.

One of my friends saw my hair. He said that he fucking hated it. He said that he would pay for my haircut and he said that he was gonna arrange a barber next week. What about my opinion? You haven't asked me? He said that I hadn't had a relationship ever, and with hair like that, I wouldn't ever get one either. Who cares? I don't cut my hair, I don't look after myself, I don't go to the gym and build a body just to get in some fake relationship that's all about looks. And this guy had long hair for years mind you. Now that a few months ago he was clean shaven, he somehow turned into a guy who hates long hair? ""Friends"" right. I like his company nevertheless. Some other friend saw me. He would oftenly joke about how I would look great in feminine clothing, and that I should ""open an onlyfans"". Hilarious jokes I know, I never found them funny. He hated the hair the most. He angrily said that I should hide that shitty hair. I thought you were with me though? You joked about feminine clothing because of my long hair but if I was to actually wear a skirt, I believe you would get me out of your life and hate me. I sent a friend whom I opened up about these feelings I had a photo. He said I was mentally ill. He assumed that I was ""turned to normal"" after I started hitting the gym. Well, the one dude who I thought would help me throughout this was also turned against me now. Really good being alone. Sure I got friends, but in reality I don't have ANYONE whom I can talk about my real feelings. Oh yea, I also had that one dude. He ""was"" pansexual. He used to help me, but he said that he turned into a Muslim and he was only a pansexual because he was a kid. He was ""normal"" now, he said. He used to preach us about loving everyone because he watched vinland saga (an anime about basically having no enemies). One time we were talking, he said that he was homophobic. I asked, you used to say that you hated no people, and what about gay people then? They can't control who they love or not? He said that he didn't consider them as ""people"" to begin with. So yeah, I am, in fact, alone in reality.

Maybe I should just buzzcut my hair. My hair is the only thing that binds me to my true self I feel like. If I cut my hair, would I forget about the gender dysmorphia and become a true man? Or will the dysmorphia kill me and I would be even more depressed and would hate myself even more? My friends would like me more that's for sure. But it's not worth it. Maybe it is, I don't know. I don't have the balls to take such a leap anyway.

Next year, I'm going to have an exam. That single exam basically singlehandedly decides which college we will be going to in Turkey. All our lives, bound by 1 single exam. I want to be an artist. I aim for graphic design in a good college here. I won't be able to do it though. The stress started hitting me already. I have only a year, so many people are ahead of me. People who go to courses, have lessons about art. I am here with only my self-made talent. I am supposed to work without sleep on art for an exam a year later. I hate it. I really enjoy drawing, but the whole year will be a nightmare. An older friend of mine. He committed suicide because of this exam. The pressure was too much for him. (There's no suicide hotline in Turkey btw, as a side note) My brother took the exam a few years ago. His routine was waking up 6 am, 2 hours of studying, 8 am to 4 pm was school, 4 pm to 8 pm was cram school. 8 pm to 10 pm was studying and he slept after. This was his routine for a WHOLE YEAR. He got into the college he wanted, he also finished grade as the top of the school. I know that I don't have this in me. I can't study this much, even if it's drawing. My father just barely agreed with me after weeks of arguments that he would allow me to go to art school. If I can't get in this year, I'm fucked.

I feel like an entitled brat. I've seen the posts here. People are going through so much worse things than me. I'm an asshole to even have suicidal thoughts right? I tried self harming today. I grabbed some knife, cut through my thigh. It hurt, there was blood. I felt nothing after it. I don't know what I was expecting. Maybe I just gaslit myself into depression? Whatever, I am not doing that again. I don't know what I'm expecting posting this here. If there is a karma limit its all for nothing anyway. If there isn't , I would most likely get a few responses anyway. I know I wouldn't read through this bullshit block of text. Venting feels good sometimes though. I don't know. I don't know what I should do. I have much more to write, but who cares anyway. I don't even care enough to write them down myself. Whatever, even if I don't get replies, it felt good to write this anyway. Lol, my first post got removed without any message or anything already.

 Your may have family, a house, friends?

My boyfriend hung himseff because of this, left me in debit holding the bag. They forclosed on my house, but lienholder said I could stay and rent it. The owner died, left him her millions, and iimmediately wants to sell it. After he bought it for $75,000 and being a contractor,  remolded everthing, so it now worth $375,000 so he wants to make money, now! Im waiting for my notice to get out. And have no family to go too. Or talk to, we had each other.

 I cant even do laundry, or have a car, he bought me a new car for us, I couldn't afford his car and his truck. I have to get car rides with strangers and it's a 2 hour drive to the drs.

 I am on disability,  for many conditions, he took care of me, now I have no one. I live in the seirras and we did all the landscaping have a guest house i went to cause it was too much to sit what was his house. But they can live off $1040 a month. I already had severe anxiety,  agoraphobia,  your house is your safe spot. But rent is too high, only a bedroom to rent with 3 cats and a dog. We used to throw the ball down the hill 3 times and he was pooped, but living in a room in a city with roomstes and a big fog, 3 cats that are indoor only, they are scared of people, they try to sneak out. I will be a prisoner in a bedroom with no bathroom with ibd, so if you gotta go, u cant wait for people to get out of the bathroom,  been there, done that, its HORRIBLE.  Im now 55, can't rock out in my bedroom, cant have pets. They are all i have. 

You think you're lives are bad, i owe $65,000 he was paying, but now gone. It was for the house. And they're complaining about food. Eat less like me.

I think theres many more reason's to want to die.

Will it actually be okay? ,"I’m 16 and I feel like my life is meaningless.


I don’t understand what’s actually wrong with me, no one likes me and I’m so alone not even my own parents. They scream and get physical with me whenever I do one thing wrong but my other siblings don’t get that.

Im the second youngest, I have 3 older brothers, 3 older sisters and one younger brother and I feel like my parents gave up on me but when my younger brother came along it’s like they had this re start and wanted to be parents again but only to him. My older siblings are all moved out and have families of their own and it’s only me and my brother at home. He’s only 4 years younger than me and my parents love him to bits. 

When they found out he was being bullied they went to the school and did all they could for him. They even got him a therapist. But when I was getting bullied they did nothing. When I said I wanted a therapist they laughed and told me I didn’t need one. When they found out about my sh they got mad and screamed at me and told my whole family even my younger brother who laughs at me and says “shut up you lit cvt yourself” 

I hate it. I hate everything but I can’t bring myself to hate them.

Not even my own boyfriend likes me, he leaves for hours and hours and he fights with me everyday. He broke up with me on our 5 month anniversary and it broke me. He didn’t love me anymore but he came back a month later saying he missed me and when we got back together it was like he didn’t care. He doesn’t notice when I’m upset or when I’m annoyed, but I love him so much and I know he doesn’t love anymore

I get told by my parents and everyone in my family how weird and stupid I am. I have dyslexia and stuff but that doesn’t even matter to them. I hate seeing my friends parents do whatever they can for them while I’m stuck being lonely having no one to talk to. I know that no one can love me and I know how un loveable I really am. But I hope one day maybe someone will tell me how much they love me and how much I mean to them and maybe even might be scared of losing me. But even then I’m being stupid. 

I get told “you’re 16 obviously you will feel sad” but I can’t do this anymore. I know im ugly and everyone else thinks that.

Please help me. I am struggling ,"Hi. I'm struggling at the moment. Let me tell you my story

Up until last summer I was happy. I had never felt lonely or depressed. Since then I moved to another country with my ex. We broke up after about 5 months after moving. I was heart broken then but out of nowhere over very shortly after the breakup. I met another woman and it made me happy again and I was completely honest with her. She knew my situation completely and while I was not able to do everything I wanted due to financial issues of moving to another country while still paying a mortgage back home.  I also have chronic sciatica that is stopping me from being able to enjoy even the most basic of things. I do have surgery coming up to fix the herniated disk so hopefully that will be sorted soon. 

I have gone on a bit of a ramble. Tldr. I am so fucking lonely and I am struggling to make friends. I don't know why it's so hard to make friends since turning 30. I just need some ideas to try make friends that doesnt involve running into another relationship as I don't think I have it in me to be heartbroken again with no friends to speak to. I've been thinking about killing myself daily with almost every other thought. Now I am not going to as honestly the only reason I could think of is that I wouldn't want to upset my family. I have spoken to my family about how I'm feeling but I don't know. They tell me to go out and do stuff. But it's not stopping the dark thoughts I am having. I work most of the week and I do go gym and keep myself busy for the most part. But I do find that while I am doing said things. I am just thinking the whole time that I want to die. I don't know if I am just lonely, depressed or if I am healthy but do just have a shit life and want to die.

Belonging in this world,"Hi all, everyday I wake up near people I love, people who are caring and compassionate and treat me very well. However despite all this I still feel so alone. I feel like I dont belong on this world that it wasnt designed for someone like me. I cannot do things for other in ways they can for me I take from others but cannot give back. The longer I go on the harder it gets to continue. I wish I could leave it all behind but would just leave more suffering in my wake.

I don't know anyone who's happy or at least okay,"So this is my plan.

I can't die right now. I'm helping my grandpa taking care of my grandma that is close to dying. Also, I need help my nephew getting into college. 

After that, my grandpa will need someone to not be alone.

But after that, I'll be able to rest. 

I once had a lot of dreams. But now I know that it doesn't makes sense, since everybody dies and everyone is in pain.

One of my dreams was to have children. If I really love them, I can't have them. I would infect them with my darkness and void. I wish to travel and know the world - for what?? Whenever I go, I'll be there. Remembering. Missing. I used to like to paint and love mathematics. But my brains seems unable to be creative or to learn anything new for the last few years.

24F- lost all my friends- lonely summer,"That’s it.. legit lost all friends I had. I had two childhood best friends and we used to hang out all the time, constantly face time and stay in touch and we grew apart. They go out and travel all the time and hang out with other people but don’t seem to want to hang out or stay in touch. We text or maybe call twice a fucking year, and they don’t even live that far away.

Ready to throw in the towel.,"I've always struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. If I mention therapy or drugs in front of my family, they look at me like I should be locked away.

Some days I feel like I should be. I've always been shy and introverted, but smart enough to recognize the signs that there are definitely issues going on. I can see the issues right in front of me, and yet I still spiral and self-destruct.

I've ruined every relationship I've had due to cheating and insecurities of feeling both inadequate and better than my partner. I recognize there is probably some underlying narcissism and potentially more issues than I can recognize. 

I never quite fit in anywhere, and I never felt like I belonged anywhere. Wherever I am I feel out of place. I feel like I'm just a spectator, not a participant in life. And the more I try to change, the more parts of me push back harder. 

I feel like I get used by people easily. ""Friends"" ask for money and I'm just so happy to have someone to talk to for 5 minutes I oblige. Then I get angry after the fact, flip out, and alienate more people from my life. 

I don't trust anybody anymore. Part of that is me projecting myself onto others; part of it is rooted in being fucked over too many times. 

I hate the way I look. I hate the way I think. And I hate the way I feel. Most of the time there's no joy in my life. The things that used to make me happy no longer do.

"Ive been ""depressed""  for a long time., for no bigger reason","I don't know whether to call it depression because it's not as extreme, I'm sure if it'd even count as a clinical depression. I can function normally but there's just something melancholic or sad about me. 
Ofcourse there have been happy moments but none of them have ever felt intense or ever had any long lasting impacts. I've been feeling this dullness since I was 13-14. 

I think there's a name for it, I remember reading the first few pages of ""I want to die but I want to eat tteokbokki"", the author describes her experience of battling with depression, I resonated with her alot. 
As she shared she always had this feeling of ""blue"" but that never stopped her from functioning normally. 

I feel the same, I can do anything but everything is so dull. Sure there are some happy moments, it's not like I never laugh or enjoy, but they're just not enough to convince me to like life. Which defeats the purpose of that advice depressed people get "" enjoy every single moment"" or something like that...It doesn't work for me, life as a whole doesn't seem worth living 

i

hobbies are rarely fun, it's like out of 100 days of reading there would be 1 day where I'd actually fully enjoy it. I'm constantly bored, even art doesn't seem fun.

 I can't feel happy with people most of the time, I thought going out would help. I do crave people, but when I get the opportunity to be with them it doesn't feel special,or good as I was expecting it would. I yearn for company all for nothing 

i was wrong ,it didn't. I was miserable while everyone was taking pictures, I was contemplating how many bones I'd break if I jump from the 2nd floor of the restaurant or repeatedly banging my head against the wall.
It was a  nice restaurant, I liked the food, everyone else was having fun. I wasn't, it showed even in the group pictures I was in.

I have no ""gusto(?)"" for anything. it's like ""ok, this thing feels nice."" but there's nothing special about it. I could watch some memes and that will feel as exciting as doing my interest which I'm supposed to enjoy. 


I get jealous of people who genuinely love their hobbies, you can always see their eyes twinkling and face becoming excited. they look so full with life. 


I on the other hand, am always so monotonous, not only does it bother me it also bothers my sister who wants to have fun with me. 

I feel bad for being this way, I know I shouldn't compare but like my life isn't that bad. sure I didn't have some things but I feel like shit for being sad when my own sister has 100x much worse than me. I'm not the one who was heavily neglected or has tons of health issues that crippled her from getting education and living her life then why am I so sad? 



I don't get it, I'm so frustrated. why are my emotions so dull, why do they feel so far away? I feel mad at myself for not fully living because these memonts will pass away, I will graduate from university in a year and I'll probably never meet these people ever again.

My last post before I end it. ,"This is it. I won't be a coward again. I've been fighting for 15 years and nothing ever changed. Every single fucking day is worse than the last.    
     
I've been diagnosed with severe depression, ADHD and Asperger's for 3 years now. I grew up in a torn and abusive household and was bullied ever since kindergarten.      
      
I've tried so damn hard for so damn long and just get beat up for it. I really just wanted to be loved. But live wouldn't even give me that. I'm so sick of this bullshit. I'm not even close to being an adult and the only fucking thing I know is pain.    
   

I wanted to die since I was a child. Honestly, I never understood why I should all of this work and effort into something I never even asked for. Just waking up every morning and coming to terms with the fact that I am actually alive, conscious and present in this world is painful on a level I can't express.   
    
I don't want this, and I never did. Life's always been nothing but a slow, boring and painful process that ultimately leads to nothing in my eyes. Every day is just a copy of the last.
     
There are no words that could convey the hatred I have for this place, for myself and everything around me. Simply being alive makes me so fucking angry. I've always wanted to die the most brutal and agonizing death I can, just to know what real pain feels like.       
        
I've never done anything for a reason. I made every choice in my life on a whim, just because I felt like it. I've done the most depraved things to myself, just for the sake of doing ANYTHING.      
         
All my therapists already gave up on me. I'm only 15 and already have been told multiple times what a hopeless case I am. I made others spiral into depression, just by talking about how I view life. I genuinely believe that I'd do the world a favor by dying.    
    
I don't deserve to be loved. I'm a thief, a liar and an addict. It's fucking pathetic. Just looking in the mirror makes me want to die.     
      
It doesn't fucking matter what I do, I always end up here, crying on the shoulders of strangers and begging for help and attention even though I don't even know what's wrong with me.    
    
      
I'm completely numb by now. Everything stopped helping. Not even drugs can still make me feel good.

What can I do being so hopeless?,"I moved to a small country a few years ago. I haven’t been able to form lasting relationships or make friends. I’m aware that I’ll never experience the feelings I had with childhood friendships, close family friends, etc.

I always feel like a burden to those around me. I’m ashamed of who I am—financially insecure, mentally unstable, and professionally frustrated.

Currently, I’m dating a guy who, despite our cultural differences, is caring and patient. However, due to my anxiety and depression, I fear I’ll lose him due to emotional exhaustion. He’s the second person I’ve been with who has said that living with my emotional instability is challenging.

My job is very draining; I work with casinos and feel like a fraud. I’ve been trying to change jobs, but it’s been difficult, even though many of my colleagues have managed to switch.

Right now, I’m in crisis. During my last one, I wished I wasn’t alive to avoid the pain and lack of energy.

With the lack of money, I’ve been having fewer therapy and psychiatry sessions. But I’m trying to maintain some consistency.

The point is: Will I ever be able to wake up and feel happy? Will I be able to have an active routine with social groups and physical activities without succumbing to negative thoughts? Will I ever be able to achieve dreams that involve other people?

"Trying, but I don’t know what for ","I’ve been suicidal on and off for years. Most of my adult life, really.

There were times the thoughts were worse, I’d thought about how and where. I’d stashed pills ‘just incase’. I’d written notes. Never solid plans, but it was on my mind all the time. 

One night things got really bad and I had an episode that could have taken my life. I was ok but that was the start of me getting therapy and I worked on myself for years. I did eventually get better. I had turned my life around in a way and thought things were going to be good from then on. I was really proud of myself for all I’d overcome. I thought I had the chance of a good life, but it was a lie. It all crumbled. Long story short, the circumstances were all my fault but I lost the thing that mattered to me more than anything. My cat, I’d had her for 6 years since she was a kitten. I loved her so much. She was always there for me and she was the reason I didn’t act on my thoughts to end it, when the pain became overwhelming. I knew no one would love her how I did, so I stayed. Then I got better and always promised her that I’d keep getting better and build a good life for us. Instead I fell for a man who claimed to love me, but just used and abused me instead. My self esteem and identity and all the work I’d done to heal was undone. Worst was what happened with me giving up my cat, only for her to die, which was the most traumatic thing I’ve been through. I died that day too, really. Nothing has been ok since then. Not really. It is all my fault she is gone. She saved my life and I betrayed her.

I tried to heal. I really did. From the outside people would think I’m doing great. I left the toxic relationship. I got a new job. New place to live. Even eventually rescued a sweet dog from the shelter, who I of course do love, but it’s just not the same. It isn’t the same connection. It isn’t enough for me to stay for. The emptiness I feel without my soul cat is too great. The pain of her being gone, knowing it was my fault and she didn’t have to go, it’s unbearable. The anger I feel towards myself, and the anger towards my ex who broke me down and took everything from me. He got to move on without any consequences. While I am left a shell of who I was. I lost my life. 

I have fought before. I have been strong before, but I always had her to comfort me. This time is different. I am more tired than ever. It’s been over 3 years since then. 3 years of trying to move on without her. I don’t know if I can keep trying. I don’t want to die, but I need all this pain to stop. I dont take care of myself anymore. I’m doing the bare minimum to survive. 

I’m just surviving out of shame now really. Because I don’t want this dog to have to go back to the shelter, and because my house is a mess and I don’t want anyone to find it this way. I’m trying to work on organising my things, but I don’t have the energy. Maybe it’s for the best, because I worry about how I’ll go with 1 less reason to stay when I already have so few. 

I’m just exhausted. It got better before, but I really don’t think it will this time. I’ve lost too much. ",throwitawaypo,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3s9fe/trying_but_i_dont_know_what_for/
Anyone with me? I just want to vent.. I'm tired of this shit.,"You know, I'm a person who doesnt give a fuck even if things are serious. The reason is because Im confident that I can take care of it once it comes to bite my ass. I also have a lot of patience, so I dont mind if people will talk shit about me or even get physical, because I know I can get through this..   
  
But these days, I think I've had enough. I'm always getting suicidal thoughts (I look fine but Im mentally unstable/dying inside), the worst part is I cant talk to anyone about it since all the people around me have grown on the fact that I AM A MAN OF STEEL! I CAN DO ANYTHING AS LONG AS I PUT EFFORT AND TIME INTO IT!! THERE IS NO PROBLEM I CAN NOT SOLVE!!!!!!!!!!

But shit! Do they even know the pain I had to go through to do that..? I've been putting a lot of work and effort into things and they think I was able to do it EFFORTLESS.. They all think Im some kind of superhuman who can do fucking anything. Everytime I get serious like I wanna speak up, they all just laugh it off since they think Im joking and that I even have the balls to boast.. (They think Im being humble since I was able to do things they couldnt) 

That's why since highschool.. I bottled everything up. My problems, my stress, anxiety, you name it. I kept it to myself since no one else would listen to me talk about it. I realized that the world really is cruel.. or its just that Im with the wrong people. But the fuck can I do? I've grown attached to them too. I wanna break free and leave but.. I cant. I'm friends with almost everyone around me, if I do it.. It'd probably fuck me over. I know I said in the first part that Im confident to take care of stuff, but we're talking about PEOPLE, and not just 2 or 3, but a literal cluster of people. I dont think I can take care of something like that.

That's why.. these days I've been thinking. Should I just k!ll myself..? To just end this shit of a life.. But Im also scared. Im not ready to die but I am willing to.. Man this is just bullshit.. Why cant I live peacefully and happily like those around me..? Everyone else looks so happy to be with me but why am I not happy to be with them?

There was this one time, I fell for a girl.. I got teased and pressured by them. Wanna know what I did? Nothing. My genuine feelings for this girl got erased since I couldnt handle the pressure. Like man, cant they give me space?! I want to work my feelings with her without anyone's bullshit getting in the way.. In the end, I did try to pursue her but I could tell she was just not interested at all. Adding in the fact that I wasted my time, I just decided to completely erase the feeling of ROMANTIC LOVE. I even went out of my way to change my own perspective of LOVE. Now I just see it as some bullshit people use as an excuse to make you do their shit. It took me years to realize all of this, and let me say. The feeling of being able to not care about that shit and move on in life is amazing. 

So if you're dealing with something similar, here's my tip:

- Just dont even care, time will pass and you'll get used to it  
- If you have the confidence to change it into a happy ending, dont do it. Trust me, I tried and no one cared. (Though if your friends and family really do care about you, do it. My life is a mess so I cant really change anything since no one that I know cares about me)

Too depressed to do anything,"I'm 22 ftm, and i have BPD, ADHD, depression, and severe anxiety (including social anxiety). 
There's times that i want to do something, i'm determined to really, but the depression makes it impossible to, and i get even more depressed about the fact that i can't get myself to do it. 
For example, my biggest issue right now is that i've been trying to lose weight. I'm 92kgs, and it's been heavily affecting my self esteem, especially because i'm a short person too, i'm 158cm, and the weight really shows. Every time i look at myself in the mirror, i feel so many horrible things, from disgusting, to disappointment, to sadness. And it's even harder for me because i have a beautiful face, as everybody around me says. And i get all sorts of comments on my body, people will tell me ""you are gorgeous if it wasn't for your body"", even my mom says stuff like that, i've heard comments from her that broke my heart on many different occasions. I've never really bothered to change anything about my body for a long time, until a couple of months ago, it just all came to me like a hurricane. And i felt like i wasn't comfortable with my body anymore. So i've been wanting to do something about it, i've even created a whole plan, to sign up at a gym and and start working out, take walks and exercise everyday, start jumping ropes at home, eating healthier, no more junk food and unhealthy beverages. But i've been too depressed to even start doing anything. And because i'm not doing anything, it's making me even more depressed, and i've been just stuck in this cycle for the past month. And i have no idea how to get out of it. I can't being myself to even get out of the house, i'm staying up until 6:00 AM, and sleeping until 2:00pm if not more sometimes, i've been skipping my meds, and i've been really irritable and angry. I'm unemployed at the moment because i'm too focused on my studies, i have one year left to get my masters degree, and i'm always so stressed during the semester, so i wouldn't be able to pull of working and studying at the same time, especially with my BPD and my unpredictable mood swings. And every day, my parents give me shit about doing nothing with my life and just sitting at home all day during the summer, and part of that feels true, but i'm an illustrator for a reason; i'm a major introvert and i'm socially anxious as mentioned before, so being an illustrator is my dream job, i could do stuff from home instead of being an employee and sticking to a schedule. I want to maybe be a youtuber, create art content, or maybe writing and illustrating my own comic book, or anything that allows me make a living in a way that's comfortable for me. So there's that, i guess what i've been trying to say is, that i want to change the course of my life, but i'm too emotionally drained, and i'm in need of some advice.

Disorders peak and I feel lower than I thought was possible, they settle and I can breathe a little better and say ‘yes’ to things again. Peaks are more frequent.

I’m in my rumination era. All my ‘no’s have caught up to me, I spend most of my time by myself because of them. The loneliness is so big. I spend most of my time physically and mentally motionless because the feeling (or lack thereof) takes up all my open spaces. 

How do you all deal with loneliness? Do you feel isolated by your depression and anxiety? Is there a way to move through, or away from, all of it and build a life again? I don’t often ask for advice, but I guess I’m in my “please help” era too. 

Lots of love to all going through it. ",Fit_Kaleidoscope2359,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4yda4/loneliness/

I had a coke relapsed ,"In a few hours my partner and I will get together and talk. My addiction has damaged our relationship since it stared but he has been there with me. He helped me get into rehab and stayed with me for the 10 months I was living there. I finished rehab Six weeks ago and things between US started to heal. We love eachother more and better than before because now we can see a future together.

But I went out on saturday and relapsed. He said to me that if that happened again he was done. He couldn't deal with it anymore. I could have hidden it but believed (and I still do) that telling him was the right choice. 

I don't know what will happen but I know this. The idea of loosing him for blow, for not having had the strength to leave The party or ask for help because i will always want to do blow. That's part of the problem. I know if he decides to go I will fall apart. Life doesnt feel right already. I'm scared and thinking of the things i'll do if we split. I don't know.

Im always comparing my life to others,"Even things like their rooms/apartments, general overall life situation, their success, looks (as in, they're able to look exactly like they want to look like. They don't have to constantly defend their choice of clothes)

I know social media is fake but even the real part that influences show (e.g. social media vs. Reality) is making me jealous. Idk if jealous is the right word, it's rather me feeling miserable if I'm thinking of myself.

I still don't have my life together. I've been struggling with mainly depression, ptsd and bpd for my whole teenage years, I've been struggling for almost 10 years straight.. and it's so hard to get back on track.

And then i see people who experienced similar things and them being successful and able to take care of themselves.. it just makes me feel really bad about myself. I wish. I still live at home which I really don't like. My family loves me and I love them but I feel so suffocated sometimes, by them and everything.

I see others succeeding while I'm kind of drowning in the crowd. Whenever I think that life can actually be good, I drop and go right back to sh and feeling miserable. I don't want to be like that.. but I don't know what to do. It feels like no matter what I do, in the end it doesn't matter, since I'll always fall back.

""Dont think so negative, obviously it doesn't work then"", I know that. Why would I not know that. It's easier for someone who hasn't been struggling with mental illness, especially for almost half their life.. sigh. I don't wanna stress negativity but it's just really bothering me currently. :/

I especially compare myself to my cousin. He hasn't had these issues. He's only 17 and he is much more responsible, he does his chores, he studies, he's very smart and he has the same interests my grandma for example has. They never say it but I cant help feeling like people prefer him. I feel like im just way too much work and effort for people and I don't want to be remembered as that. I feel like I ruin everyone that lives with me, gets close with me or tries to help me. This makes me want to disappear so bad. I don't know what to do anymore.

You know what’s not fair?,"TW: death, suicide

I think of all those infant deaths. All of those shots at life that they missed. Maybe they would have made something great out of it.

Think of all young happy people who died of random terminal illness or freak accidents. Most of them wanted to live longer but the universe denied them that.

Then I think of myself. I don’t want this life. Ten attempts in as many years, all failed, it’s clear for some reason I can’t go through with this. But I hate this life. I’m garbage who doesn’t deserve to live, but doesn’t want it either.

But the same universe who denied those people their lives is keeping me alive against my will. Both sides are so cruel, so awful. Why can’t I trade myself for one of them? They get to live, and maybe make something beautiful out of it, I stop wasting life and end this miserable existence.

Reasons to live,"First I want to say I came from r/therapy the auto mod said to come here so here I am
Here's my original message:

I don't really feel like explaining my whole life story right now, just know it's really only getting worse.  To put it simply, I've lost basically all my friends.  I've lost my dog and my girlfriend.  My parents seem so unhappy with their lives as adults, and I really just don't enjoy life anymore.

On top of that, the world is a crazy shitshow and I really don't understand what the point in living is.  What great reason is there to go on?  For love?  I highly doubt with my mentally unstable self, I will ever find someone who loves me unconditionally.  For money? Yeah I ain't gonna be wealthy either, my parents are having a hard enough time just paying rent let alone groceries and helping me with school or trying to get me diagnosed and forget paying for any medication.  For fun? Nothings fun about this world.  Terrible people continue to run free from any guilt and any problems.  I've seen so many bad people get away with things and see no repercussions, and I try my best to be loyal and respectful to everyone (admittedly I fail for sure) but I try to be nice and I get the short end of the stick for trying to be a decent person.  

I'm convinced there's no good reason I should stay in this world, what logical sensical reasoning is there for enduring any more years of this?  I've lost so much and I don't want to throw myself a pity party, but everything's terrible.  My life has nothing going for it, no bright future, I'm not smart, I have a screwed up brain, living in a world where nobody cares about me, there's seriously no reason to keep going.

I don't know why I keep going, I guess part of me still has hope but I really think it would be better if I was dead.  The only ""enjoyment"" I get out of life is playing video games and half the time I don't even like playing games they're only a coping mechanism.  I always feel lonely no matter what anyone says.  I don't think I've loved anything or anyone since my dog passed.  I just don't want to kill myself because that would hurt my parents too much, I couldn't do that to them but I seriously don't see any other reason to keep going",Ill_Night533,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2vhe4/reasons_to_live/

On the outside looking in,"I have a family member who is going through some serious depression. Rightfully so this person has been through a lot.

No one deserves to live a life like that. So down that the only way out is death. I can’t imagine my life without this person. I feel like my family and I have exhausted all our options and nothing seems to get this person out of this dark hole.

I need someone to come and save me, to take a strong an suddenly interest in my wellbeing. To hold me when I'm having a breakdown and to bring me a bite to eat when I haven't left my bed all day. Someone to pet me and get me to go on a walk with them. Someone to laughing with at stupid things, Someone for me to help as well.

But I don't have that person. I don't have friends, at least none that close. I'm alone. Just me and my cats. I also take help take care of my grandparents that live close by. My mother is in another country, she's dying as well. 

So either someone appears tomorrow and rescues me, or i will do the barely minimum to live, i will take care of those who need me, then the second they are all buried and dead, I will kill myself.

I’m so tired of trying to be happy.,"I can’t do it anymore.

This world sucks. We’re always reaching some unattainable goal of happiness, suffering through hours every single day just so we can get some dopamine later. I just don’t want to live that way.

My years have gone like this since I could remember:
January-June: Work, classes, sleep, repeat. Too tired to do anything fun because I get worn out.
June-August: Finally relaxing while I wait for impending doom
September-December: Work, classes, sleep, repeat again. 

I’ve repeated this endless cycle forever and I will continue it until the day I die because it’s impossible to break it. It’s simply life in civilization, and it’s come to the point where you can no longer choose to live in the forest or something, but I don’t like it. I don’t want to wait through months of suffering just to get some enjoyment out of life. All I’ve been told is “suck it up” or “I’m sorry, I understand” but that doesn’t give me a solution. I’m a control freak in a world with no control and it brings me misery.

My mother recently took away my self-harming tools and I’ve been at my breaking point. That was my last ditch attempt at coping and it’s now taken away by the people who love me so I can’t even get mad. I don’t think I’ll kill myself anytime soon, but I can’t see myself being alive any further than this. I’ll most likely do it by the start of the school year if something doesn’t change. Life sucks and I don’t want to deal with that. I never asked to deal with that, to be born, but it seems I have to manually take myself out.

Having Trouble Coping,"I struggled with depression as a teenager and was able to build up a life and move myself out of that mindset with some usual tactics, keeping busy, setting goals, exercise, etc. Almost two months ago I had laser eye surgery which has rendered me unable to work or drive.

I’m really struggling to cope, I just want everything to end. I have constant discomfort in my eyes, I have 20/15 vision but can barely see, I have to take medication for constant pain, I can’t even open a window because the outside light is too bright. I have doctors working with me but it’s been over a month with not very much improvement. I was working on my masters thesis which will likely be delayed, I’m almost broke because I can’t work, I sit inside all day struggling to use a computer that hurts me half the time because the screens are too bright even on the minimum brightness setting. I feel like I will end up on disability and I can’t handle that. I can’t be a burden on society, I can’t have nothing.

One dumb decision that everybody else will tell you is the greatest decision they ever made and your life is fucked. The clinic will tell you that you’ll be up and driving in 7 days. Your independent optometrist can tell you that you’re an ideal candidate. Fucked. My life is at a minimum delayed and going to be very hard for a year.

I want to die after my ex disabled me,"My ex (wlw relationship for context) was arrested for felony DV. I was the victim. She hit me with a truck and gave me a traumatic brain injury. I have permanent brain damage for the rest of my life. She attacked me with a knife, she called me r*tarted knowing I’m diagnosed autistic, she said I deserved to be r*ped. A lot of it I have on video. I even have her on video confessing to the abuse and saying if I told anyone she’d k*ll herself or me. She got away with the abuse a lot because I would call the cops and she’d attempt suic*de so they’d have to take her to the hospital instead of arresting her. She used her mental illnesses as an excuse for her behavior. She blamed it on bpd and schizophrenia. She even blamed me. She got probation and they will remove the felony once she completes probation. I feel completely robbed of justice. I live in constant mental and physical pain from what she did. Everyone is telling me to move on but it’s hard when my disabilities SHE GAVE ME affect me every day. I want to just die and end this. She’s broken the restraining order multiple times and the cops won’t do anything. 

She manipulated me for so long like saying it was my fault for getting hit with the truck bc I ran after my car after she stole it but I was on the side walk.  Doesn’t matter if I was doing backflips on the side walk if you run off the road and ran someone down on the side walk that’s your fault yk? She said it was my fault she stabbed me with a knife bc she was trying to off herself not me. She’s telling everyone I was the problem.  Even despite it being on video and her being found guilty in criminal, civil, and military court she STILL won’t take responsibility. It’s so hard to move on when someone is doing stuff like that and won’t even acknowledge what they did. 

I have nightmares about her.  Every night she’s haunting my dreams. Sometimes I dream she apologizes, and that’s when I know it’s just a dream.  

I want to die I want to end this suffering. I hate myself for staying with her for so long. I hate what she did and what she continues to do. Yet I still mourn the life I dreamed of having with her.

Prescribed Wellbutrin for Depression ,"I was diagnosed by my therapist and psychiatrist with depression and was prescribed Wellbutrin. A lot of my symptoms involve lack of motivation, overwhelming feelings of being uninspired, having a fatalistic attitude towards my day (like no matter what I do, I'm convinced of a negative outcome for a lot of things,) sometimes having random spells of being emotional, and feeling too overwhelmed to engage in my tasks for the day so much that I just end up sleeping a lot. When I do push/fight through to get something done, it feels very exhausting and often don't feel accomplished even if the outcome was great on paper.

My psychiatrist mentioned that this is not a stimulant, which I am trying to avoid, but that this would help with those symptoms, especially with getting my motivation regulated. 

Id like to ask if anyone in this sub has had any success or failures with this medication. How has your experience been? Did you have similar symptoms that improved after taking this medication? Also, I'd appreciate any tips you might have for when you're on the medication (i.e. drinking more water than usual, adding/avoiding certain foods, etc.)

Diagnoses ,"Was anyone else surprised when they got diagnosed with depression? I've had it since I was around 12-13, but was not formerly diagnosed until I was about 16. I don't understand why but I felt like I always knew it was depression, but just felt completely shocked when I was officially depressed. Ig i expected to be fine even though i cried myseld to sleep every day for a year and was deep in denial. Same thing with anxiety, which was diagnosed at the same time. I thought  I was shy, turns out it's not normal to feel like dying after walking weird or having to talk to a cashier. Does anyone else feel this way? The sense of anguish has not left me and I recall the day I was diagnosed almost every day. I grieve the person I could've been if not for my stupid brain.

Keeping it simple. I just don't like being alive.,"People always tell me to keep living this, and don't kill yourself that, but honestly, for what? I'm gonna die anyway. We're living in a world that's run by hatred, evil, and selfishness. I don't really want to live in a world like that. I often find myself pondering about my life, thinking to myself, is there really a point to continue living? Even if I get what I want, how long will I stay satisfied? Whenever I'm having fun, eventually it ends. Whenever I'm relaxing or chilling out, eventually it ends. Everything is temporary, and honestly it's just really boring. Even the few things that still excite me to this day have a weaker effect on me than it did years ago. Maybe it's because my life's just been on a downwards spiral ever since I graduated high school. Maybe I just lost any and all passion of living. I'll admit, I made a lot of messed up decisions and probably wouldn't be as suicidal as I am now if I didn't mess up immensely, but to be honest? I'm in a state to where I really just don't want to deal with anything anymore. I'm not even upset about it either, although I have Major Depressive Disorder. I just don't really feel anything, and in a way that's worse than being straight-up sad or depressed. Maybe I'll feel something when I die? Maybe in death, I'll start feeling again? Death, unlike anything else, is permanent, and maybe it's exactly what I'm looking for. A break from the mundane. The routine.

"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,177,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
i had a close (kinda) experiencie with someone trying to commit suicide.,"i live on a closed and private urbanization of condos, and around 6:40 pm the group chat of the urbanization went crazy. people were asking to help someone and for someone to please call ambulance. that’s when i we (my parents and i) started hearing someone screaming outside.

this was a woman, she was crying hard. she was screaming: “please don’t let this be true”, “somebody please tell me that is a nightmare”, “please tell me that my daughter is well”. all the neighbors were around her trying to help. people called the police and the ambulance, she kept crying and screaming. 

after a few minutes a white car appeared and entered really fast until it came close to the woman screaming. it stopped abruptly and people got out of it. it was family of the girl and her mom.

people approached to the house. 

when the police came, they entered. i was talking to a neighbor who had more context of what was going on. it seems the girl already had some mental health problems. he told me that her mom entered the house but didn’t found her anywhere -the sad thing is, she’s a 27 year old that has a baby of 12 to 18 months i would say- she found the baby on the bed undressed (he’s okay) and the bathroom door locked. she started knocking on it but no answer. that’s when she realized what was going on and started to cry for help.

around that time the neighbor was telling me that, another of the neighbors happened to be a nurse, so when the police came, the nurse, a cop and a familiar of the girl went into the house. one of them went down and told us to please keep calling the ambulance; the girl seemed to don’t have any pulse.

they returned upstairs and a few minutes later the ambulance arrived. they came downstairs and statutes saying that she needed reanimation. minutes after, she regained pulse.

it seems she took pills, we don’t know how much and since how long.

they took her out of the house the ambulance runed away with her. that was at around 7:40 pm. we haven’t heard anything yet. (it’s 10:47 pm we i am)


this is the first time i experience this kind of situation and my head is spinning. hearing the mom screaming, watching her family rushing in, the police, the ambulance coming in and taking her out… but what striked me the most was watching her baby in the arms of her husband and thinking: how could you do that to him? (i don’t mean to judge) i felt so sad for that little boy… as i said she appeared to be alive when they took her away, i hope she is. i hope all the family is okay. i don’t know what she was going through but i hope she recovers and get to see her son and her husband.

if you are having thoughts or if you are in a bad place please seek help, please talk to somebody. there is people out there that loves you, even if you feel that there isn’t i can guarantee you that somewhere out there there is somebody that loves you. things will get worse before they start to get better, so please keep fighting, you’re gonna make it , you’re gonna pull through it, you’re gonna be okay, everything is gonna be okay.

I want to punish myself through starting a disciplined lifestyle,"I hate myself. Never gotten into cutting or other type of self-harm, but have my history with unhealthy eating behavior and sometimes use alcohol as a coping strategy as well.

The only things I actually have to do and therefore get done are my job duties and taking care of my own basic needs. 
This has lead to me thinking I could as well try to reach some kind of toxic productivity-mode (partly because I need to get my shit together and partly to get an outlet for the self-loathing).

Over-exercising, a workaholic attitude towards my job and getting rid of some everyday comforts such as bed frame and also quitting warm showers are some examples on my mind.

"I, (M22) am completely stuck. ","I don’t know how to put this into words but here’s what I’m dealing with:

Severe Misophonia, chronic back pain(unknown cause, dozen of unsuccessful treatments over the course of about 7 years), severe social anxiety- literally zero friends whatsoever, religious disagreement with family, frequent headaches, depression, (thankfully mild most of the time, except every week or so when I get lonely and it smacks me in the face and tells me I have nothing of value to offer to anyone and no future) and no life skills/degree or employment of any kind.

 I have also never had sex/kissed/held hands/been on a date in my life. I can literally only think of one time a girl my age even hugged me.  It was about 7 years ago (when my life was just starting to fall apart) and she only hugged me because she was a very friendly/affectionate kind of person and we happen to be in the same group at Mormon youth conference thing (she hugged everyone goodbye). We barely ever spoke to each other and I don’t even remember her name. 

I have plenty to be thankful for too, or at least I *should* be, but somehow that just makes me feel like I’m even more useless for not being able to get my life together. Anyway the positives are:

Parents (still married and in a good relationship) are supportive with my struggles, other than the religion thing. They’re VERY Mormon/LDS and cannot accept that I don’t believe anymore. (I stopped at around 16).

I managed to get my driver’s license and GED after dropping out of school in 10th grade.(due to the back pain and misophonia)

Good financial situation. Of course I’m completely dependent on my parents(which makes me feel worthless sometimes) while we’re not exactly rich, we’re probably middle to maybe upper middle class, by the standards here in the US. 

Depression is also not quite as bad as it was at 16-17, in large part due to therapy. 

The thing is, all my problems compound on each other. 
Want to get a job? Well I can’t because my back is going to demand I lay down after 30 minutes of sitting, standing or walking. But why try when it’s going to send my anxiety through the roof? And what is someone triggers my misophonia, so I just sitting there, suffering with extreme rage, while my body pumps me full of all the hormones it thinks I need to be prepared for my imminent death?

So what if I work from home then? How many jobs are there that let me work as few and as erratic hours as I need to manage the pain, while also minimizing social interaction? Oh and all I have for my resume is a GED and zero previous employment. 

How do I make friends when I have nowhere to go? No school, college, church or workplace. Not to mention I live in the dead center of the mormoniest part of Utah. I’m instantly going to be an outsider, as an agnostic-ish person. I’m not even anti-Mormon or looking to get into arguments or anything. People aren’t mean about it, but there’s always that slight distance between us.(which my social anxiety insists will ruin everything)

What about friends online? I have had some people I played online games with in the past, and had some I would call friends. But they didn’t last. Like all of my other friendships, they were shallow, I think because I suck at taking interest in other people, and we drifted apart. 

That’s only half the problem though, because my mom dislikes online game relationships . I’m not forbidden from playing games with people online, and she has actual agreed that it could be good for me to interact with people like that. The thing is, I have no privacy. Most of the day, it’s just me and my mom in the house, where she could overhear anything I say, or walk in at any moment. It’s not like I plan on doing anything she would disapprove of, but my anxiety doesn’t care. Even now, if she walks into the room while I’m just watching a harmless youtube video my heart rate spikes. So anytime I try to play online games with people there’s this stress that my mom is listening to and judging everything I say. Not to mention it’s just awkward to have your mom there while you’re trying to hang out with your friends.

The religion thing is at a stable but mutually unsatisfying stalemate. It makes interacting with my siblings awkward, and I usually avoid my extended family as best I can. My parents occasionally preach to me a little and everyday I have to read a page of the Book of Mormon and come to family prayer. I put up with it because they made it clear that those are the rules in this house and I figured it’s the least I can do considering how much they’ve worked to try to help me, not to mention raising me. 

The thing is, I sometimes hate it here. I hate living in this beautiful house with loving parents, free food, free WiFi and minimal responsibilities. I want to do something. I don’t know what because I’m not good at anything and every time I leave I am rewarded with physical and emotional suffering. I’m so socially defunct that I can’t hold a conversation with anyone, not that I get many opportunities to. But even being very inverted I get really lonely when I learn something cool and have no one to share it with, or when I need advice and have no one who can relate to me or when I realize that on my current trajectory, I’ll never fall in love, let alone get married and start a family. 

I’m not sure why I’m posting this, I guess it’s easier to be honest if I’m anonymous.

How are people coping w/o meds?,"I’m on month 3(?) w/o my meds after finally finding a small cocktail that works and I feel like I’m losing grip of my mental. I’m figuring out how to get a refill on my prescription after breaking up w my therapist but I’m struggling in the meantime.

I’ve been working out at home a bit, socializing over the phone and on the game w my friends, bathing regularly, journaling, working on my goals but I’m also hating myself, constantly ruminating on things from my past, wanting to isolate, cut/kill myself. Every time I reroute my thinking it goes right back to thinking all the thoughts that make me hate myself and hate my life. When I was medicated, I was able to be more accepting of and gracious towards myself.

yeah,"I’m eighteen years old. This year was supposed to be my graduation, but I sunk deeper into my head and neglected my studies. Not quite sure if there is or has ever been any hope for me, for a sustainable well being or any chance of success. I’m tired of waking up every day and being clouded with self hatred and guilt, and by now I think there’s enough data to be fairly certain that I’m going to stay a failure. Not graduating was the nail in my coffin, possibly literally. 

When it got bad, I was about six months into my online school program. It was fine at first, but then I stopped leaving home altogether. My dad worked everyday, and I stayed in my head. Around five months later, I stopped touching my homework. Video games, porn, and weed became my life. I’m cringing writing that because it sounds so cliche, but it is painfully true. I refused to do any tests because it involved having to be watched via video chat, my heart raced and I became dizzy even thinking about having to feel the gaze of someone else on me, the awkward silence, and so this became my typical reaction to any anxiety provoking thoughts or situations. I would shut down completely. Now, I feel broken. And I honestly don’t think I have what it takes to do a full one eighty and face these fears.

Cheated kind of and don't know how to feel about it,"Male 26 I've been with this girl for 2 years and I've had quite a lot of relationships before.

I think she cheated on me but even though if i assume she didn't cheat she started seeing an other guy nearly after a week and we've been together for 2 years. That's still cheating for me.

"I got used to live with depression, but after a bit of happiness idk if i will get used to emptiness again","From the age of 13 when my dad died until a few months ago(im 23 now) I had the mindset that I didn't need to be happy to survive. (""Im not a good person if I complain about my sadness when there is more suffering out there"").

I experienced bullying in school, lacked money, and had no desire to do anything outside of my home. Also, I felt inferior to others. Throughout high school, I never hung out with friends, and my only distractions were video games and music. 

When I entered university, my social anxiety improved, but I still lacked the desire to connect with people or pursue hobbies. I completed my degree and only went out with friends once during that time.

Despite this, I forced myself to engage in normal hobbies, watch movies and series, and participate in sports. I didn't want to appear as the odd one who had no interests or conversation topics. Happiness wasn't a priority; my goal was to have a decent professional career and support my family, I wanted the people next to me to be happy even if I wasnt.

However, fate intervened this year when I met a woman on a dating app who showed genuine interest in me just as I am. We shared everything in common, and our three-month relationship made me feel alive, not just existing. Unfortunately, she ended things and returned to her ex. I feel so empty now.

I know normal people would just get another gf, but I feel every single human is unique, and if wasnt her, Im sure I wouldnt ever have a relationship.

I have no complaints about the people around me or my job. People are generally kind, and I reciprocate that kindness. However, I lack motivation to do anything. I just keep doing what I have to do. My willpower exists solely to avoid disappointing others. I exercise and eat healthily for physical well-being, and I try to be sociable. 

I have no goals, no enjoyment in anything, no hobbies, no desire to travel, or acquire material possessions, or meet other women. I even stopped playing videogames, guitar and piano.

Yet, I can't contemplate ending my life because I want to continue supporting my family. I cant let my family become sad because of my death, and I really fear death myself, so I am afraid I am unable to get used to live a sad life again.

Everyone I loved never truly cared about me ,"Came out as gay at 30 and it wasn't received well
I'm now 32 and still not fully out. 
I have had lesbian sex and it's some of the best sex of my life-- if anything I can say I at least had that already! 

I've been abandoned by my family - mother is a malignant narcissist who only cares about image and my enabling coward father and sister wouldn't stand up for me and none of them give a fuck about my human dignity or if I live or die. My mother attempted to eradicate  my soul.

My college best friend who I was in love with is catholic and now engaged to a man. We could never be together in reality but I feel like she used me for emotional closeness and never truly was able to validate my love for her. She told me she loves me but I feel entirely invalidated as a human being by her.

My only hope is that I'm going to be getting onto weight loss drugs soon and am going to get into therapy and start the healing process but I don't think I'll ever fully feel normal again after being discarded by my heartless family and watching the love of my life marry a man and start a life with him. I know our love and the feelings we have towards each other are much more real in comparison to what she has with this average man but I am being eaten alive by the fact he gets to have her and i prob won't see her again for years. He only got her because he has a dick and I don't. If I had been born a man I'd get to be with her forever. Like-- none of it was real yet it was all real to me. Sometimes I don't  think she truly cares if I exist or not. I also think she's a covert narcissst or a sociopath idk. She's the only woman who truly knows me but I haven't started to date women yet who are out of the closet and comfortable in their sexuality. She was my ""pre coming out"" love. I think about her 24/7 and my thoughts have been consumed by her for 5 years. We still message each other every day despite her being engaged to the man. I'm sure she prob liked me but she could never act on the feelings I guess... it's horrible. I want to consume her in every way.

I've put my all into these relationships and received barely anything in return. I've been isolating myself for a while. I don't feel like my existence on this earth matters anymore and it's a very chilling feeling. What's the point anymore. I was everything I could be and it was never enough for anyone!

"I had ADHD and then depression, now I have severe task paralysis that it’s destroying my life, what can I do?","I am 40m, and I have been diagnosed with adult ADHD when I was 30 years old, and lord knows how hard I try to push myself forward, I tried everything, going to the gym regularly, meditated every morning, breaking down my tasks into small portions, setup check lists, morning routines, self-help books, therapy…the whole nine yards.

After a series of life altering events that occurred throughout the entire 2023 (serious auto accident, death of a loved one, betrayal of my business partner, wife of 20 years divorcing me, sudden debt, legal trouble on false accusations), I fell into deep depression and has been of antidepressants for almost a year now.

Although I’ve gotten past the worst phase where I couldn’t even get out of bed, and even when I did, I just stared lifelessly at the TV, and spent most of my days planning on how to off myself, now to the point where I can begin to function, get back to work (I’m an entrepreneur and have my own small business), and live a life that mildly resembles that of my old one.

But I seem to have lost all motivation to do anything, It would take me literally hours, if not days to even write an email, and when I do, I would be mentally exhausted.  My brain would keep shouting “Just effing do it already!!!” Repeatedly and my body wouldn’t even budge the slightest and just kept on watching YouTube video after YouTube video.

And every night when I am in my bed, I could not stop beating myself up over doing nothing for the whole day, calling myself the nastiest of names just hoping I could shame myself into not repeating the same thing the next day, but to no avail, to the point I would bury myself in my pillow and just cry helplessly.

I know I should be more positive for the self talk, but I just can’t bring myself to, of course there are good days and bad days, but more often than not, it’s bad.

I have noticed that the suicidal thoughts have been coming back, I am truly scared I might actually give in to it, but the paralysis is preventing me from doing anything, and mostly I feel like a dead man walking.

I really want to get my life back, I want to stop acting like a bystander and watch my own business slowly die in my own hands, but I don’t know if there is any hope left for me, Im so tired and I don’t know if I have any fight left in me at the age of forty.  

I think I’m still hanging in there for my son who I love so much.  Im tearing up as I type this out, but I don’t know what to do.

How to get help? ,"After deleting the last two posts I deleted on this subreddit maybe this one is gonna stay a bit longer. 
I'm 19 years old and I wanted to kill myself for about six years but never got closer to actually doing it than making a knot in a rope to hang myself or ""almost"" jumping of bridges as I don't have access to guns (if I had I'm very certain I would be dead already). 

Over the years I often kinda hurt myself (like slapping myself, carving my skin with sticks a little, putting my hands against hot stuff till I couldn't take it anymore) but never really viewed it as actual ""to be taken serious"" self harm because I didn't want to admit to myself that I need help. 
Last night I however took some scissors and cut my left arm in several locations and put lemon juice on the wounds so it would hurt more so I'd be able to ""escape"" my feelings. 
Long story short today I got up and took a shower and then noticed that there's visible cuts on my arm from last night (could've figured that was gonna happen earlier but I'm just a mess lately and it's affecting my thinking) and I realised I'll have to hide that wound because I don't know how I'd explain it. 

I also realised that I can no longer act like I have normal issues everybody has and I feel so guilty because I should be the stable factor for my girlfriend (she has bpd) but instead I'm a mess and on the verge of breaking up with her because I'm just on an overload of emotions even though I don't even have any excuse for being so depressed, as far as I know I don't even have any trauma??

Anyway I thought about getting help and talking to a therapist but I'm so scared to do that because therapists are also just people and I hate talking about my issues to other people, especially because I don't even understand what's wrong with myself.

Giving up on life after layoff,"I am a software developer and like many of us I got laid off 4 months ago. To explain my story from the top college was a depressing time for me, I did whatever I could to graduate without debt, the community college route, stayed home all 4 years but shit went sideways with a transfer to the college at the 2 year mark of my journey I wanted not working out and it led to a suicide attempt which landed me in the hospital, at my parents insistence even though I wanted time to rest, they wanted me to apply wherever I can and get going with a transfer to graduate within the normal 4 year timeframe. I didn't have a choice so within a day I got back from the hospital I started applying and got into a school, so I did, still made the call to stay home to save money due to the pandemic. I still really had a tough time working through my mental shit with therapy and balancing that with school, I barely scraped by with my grades, my professors there as a silver lining had connections to an extremely prestigious institution for computer science which I ended up getting an internship through that and working with them. I barely had a social life unless friends came back from their college. Despite everything, inevitably I graduated in 2022 within the 4 years without debt like my parents wanted and I got a 3 job offers from reputable companies within 3 months of searching.

When I accepted the job out of the 3, I was finally happy, it was fully remote, great benefits, and solid WLB. I was off to a strong start, and it felt great. I got along with my coworkers and managers. I moved out and lived on my own on the first time, could buy all the stuff that I wanted. I thought for the first time I made it, and I could start living my life. I got showered praise from manager for around 7-8 months, and he reassured that I am doing great. My director after I met him in person for my first business trip really liked me and even offered me to help him with a project he was overseeing from the ground up for the company. He even messaged me personally that I was getting a substantial raise without me even asking which was based on performance. A couple weeks later I got the raise however, there was another lead person I answered to on the technical side of the main stack I worked on and unfortunately with it being my first job I was still learning the ropes and I was beyond the 6-month mark (8 months) and during the code review I asked an extremely stupid coding question which I am embarrassed to repeat. He didn't say anything to me that meeting, and when I had my 1-1 with my direct report a couple days later, I was told by him that my tech lead said ""he doubted my competency to do my job"" with a meeting that included all the managers, tech leads, and director. So eventually it became this cycle of him complaining to my direct report/management first, so it was always a 2v1 against me and my direct conversation with him happened after the fact. In between this my direct manager said everything was going fine and even got constant praise from my director, I tried my best to improve wherever I can but it made things confusing on how I was doing. Eventually we had this meeting before Christmas where all the teams got together within our division and the leads of each stack talked about, we did. The tech lead proceeded to credit everyone in the summit for their specific contributions in the stack and left me out, not even crediting for helping out with a project someone else was working on which he brought up.

That led into my next meeting where due to circumstances my original direct report had have an extended leave transferred his responsibilities to a different manager and proceeded to put me on a PiP and my tech lead would be involved. My manager was put on one before and said I can get through it. At this point I wanted to keep my job because of the market and despite everything that happened I wanted to stay here and have a long-term career. Long story short it was grueling, day in day out I had to attend every meeting in our division, work long hours, constantly felt like my tech lead made jabs at me during code reviews in front of everyone even once telling me in front of my entire team when I built a design document which said he was right at a high level when I asked him in a dm the day before, then in the code review telling me it was wrong and told me that ""I was just guessing"" in front of everyone.

Eventually the dreaded message came to meet my director for a 1-1 in a Teams meeting a couple weeks before my PiP ended, and I got the news I was laid off with a bunch of other employees. It was probably due to what happened with my performance review last year and despite that in the meeting my director said he can be a reference and he got everyone else he could on the team to give me assistance with finding a new job through endorsements and recommendations. Didn't get a single message from my original direct report and the last message I got from my tech lead as the team immediately received the news of the layoff was a notification that he removed me from the code review teams meetings despite my corporate account being deleted within the hour.

I am now 3 months in the job search, and I haven't landed a single interview from any application I submitted. I am getting to the point now where I have to force myself to apply my jobs and applying to less and less each day. Despite tuning my LinkedIn, getting recommendations from several colleagues ranging from my director, other tech leads, managers and developers who liked me at my last job and getting my resume reviewed by multiple people even an ex-FAANG recruiter who said it's in a good spot. Tried everything from tuning my resume for each position, changing the format, unique cover letters, to even shotgunning applications nothing I send is sticking. I have 3 months of unemployment left and another year of savings after that so I can last till my apartment lease ends. But now I am getting pressured by my parents to take the first offer since I have only gotten interviews from recruiters calling me for bottom of the barrel contract jobs. I know they are probably right but I just don't know how I will have the energy to job search when managing another job.

I am starting to give up on life and just wondering what the point of it all is. The job was the only thing I had in college that proved everything I did and sacrificed was worth it; I am close to my mid 20's I realized I missed out on huge amount of social opportunities and long-lasting friends or relationships in college and I am not unemployed which makes it even worse. I still have friend groups in my childhood I am still very close with but it's hard to feel everyone is passing you by while you struggle and get lectured on what to do. I just feel an extreme amount of jealousy towards everyone I know since they have their jobs still and are advancing professionally and socially and seeing many of my old colleagues getting promotions on LinkedIn. Recently, I sometimes feel that I should have ended my life that day in 2020 because I feel like either way, I fail one way or the other, I have been seeing a therapist and while it has been helping idk if it's enough. I know people tell me to just pick yourself up and keep trying but I am tired of everything and life.",depresseddevguy,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4bk62/giving_up_on_life_after_layoff/

Feeling Anticipatory Grief For Years ,"
Hello everyone I hope you're feeling better than I am right now


I've always known that I wouldn't have the same experiences as peers my age because I have older parents, they were 39(mom) and 58/9(dad) respectively when they had me 


I love my parents so much but I knew early on that I'll probably say goodbye sooner than my peers with their parents, whilst I pray to my Allah that I'll have more time with them, I can't help ny feelings about death 


My father died a couple years ago and even though I knew it was coming for years due to his age and illnesses it absolutely broke me, I was broken and probably am still broken from his death, I experienced grief later on because whilst I cried and mourned for weeks after his death it was around 2 months after where it really hit me that he died, I changed and was feeling suicidal for a long time but I couldn't do anything because I knew my mother was still here and I have to be strong for her 


Now I am still praying my mother lives for a long long time, I can't help but be scared and anxious for her leaving me, she has her own health problems and I am scared and petrified of what ifs, I can't lose another parent especially not my mother


I know I probably have Anticipatory Grief, I've had it since I was a child, it damaged my thinking now as an adult because I formed a fear of missing a call or getting called at night thinking it is bad news, back when I was a child whenever I get a phone call at night I was scared that it was because of my father passing, and he really did pass at night, I got call from his caretaker that he passed in the hospital, I was about to visit him in the morning and he passed, I couldn't even see him before he was buried due to circumstances


I am still scared that one day my mother will also leave me and I don't know if I can live on without her

I’ll never trust a mental health professional again,"I’m currently going through an assessment for autism. At my last visit after hours of testing, the psychologist brings up my suicidal ideation. And keeps bringing it up. She says she can’t let me leave until she talks to her supervisor, then says “we decided hospitalization won’t be beneficial at this time”. I was trying to be as honest and open as possible for the purpose of evaluating me correctly.  I will never trust one of these people again.

I am so tired of these waves...,"To be honest, I don't even care if people are gonna read this or not, I just need to get it out.

I feel cursed. I don't know how to explain but this is how I've been feeling for now 3 years.

I feel so depressed, helpless and misunderstood that I just lost hope this feeling will leave me for ever...

I've been depressed for 1 year as a 10 y.o because of bullying and other stuff. It was so bad that at a point I had suicidal thoughts on daily basis.
I escaped this horrible soul crushing feeling somehow... or so I thought.

On the last year of middle school the same feeling comes back but this time the situation was way different.

I had A LOT of people around me but only a few actual friends. Even though I was loved from a lot of people, I felt so so lonely...
To the point that it was getting hard to fake being happy.

The reason of that?? I DON'T KNOW!!!
I mean, I lived some tough things but I went through worse.
I tried to find the reason why but was unsuccessful and I still am...

These waves last for sometimes weeks but longest was 7 months (last year).

Last year I had a whole week where it felt like I was in a constant nightmare. I felt lost, extremely tired and kinda scared for some reason.

It's been 3 years since it came back and it's killing me inside. I feel like a hole in my chest and I can't fill it.

I wanna fill it with love but even that is too much to ask for, I somehow will end up ruining it like a lot of things.

I feel like I will never experienced real love, unconditional love, mutual love. Someone always ends up getting hurt.

I feel so lonely to the point it hurts physically, 
I hate that my mother sees me being sad, I can't even express all of this to her as it will result to nothing.

I'm tired of faking, tired of failing, tired of this unbearable pain.

28M in pain amd feeling worrthless. Wishing for my end.,"I had my life with me for a year but then she left and it has been 1.5 years since. Been depressed since and even now when I think I am getting better, I have moments of pure terror and heartbreak which leaves me crying to the point of feeling like I can't breathe.

To be honest, I did try meeting new people, being in a relationship even but everyone just leaves. I am in a constant state of wanting to be with someone yet scared of everyone who I see being a part of my life be it as a friend or something else. I cry for atleast an hour every night and I experience moments of wanting to kill myself.

I need help and I don't know what to do. I miss her yet I don't have the courage to talk to her as I know she won't want to talk to me. I would only end up being a nuisance to her and her happiness.

l feel like a retard 😓 [19 M],"I often get made fun of for my poor English skills, which makes me really anxious about speaking. Just thinking about it gives me panic attacks. My classmates tease me about how I look, so I don’t really consider them friends. I’ve always dreamed of having a British accent, hoping it would help me fit in better. But most of the time, I feel lonely and isolated. At 19, I haven’t had the usual experiences like going to parties or having close friends. I worry about my future a lot and feel like I’ve failed, even though I used to dream of being an astronaut since I was four. Agoraphobia keeps me indoors; I’m too scared to go outside, even when my family goes on trips. I constantly think about my flaws and feel empty, much more than just typical teenage struggles.

Living in a developed country where everyone speaks English fluently makes me feel even more inadequate. I get jealous when I hear someone from another country speak with a perfect accent and flawless grammar, and it makes me feel like I’m not brave enough. Even my relatives, including my cousin, call me a coward because I’m afraid to speak English. Whenever I try to speak, it usually ends with people laughing or avoiding me. High school was tough; I was bullied a lot, called names like “monkey,” and people made hurtful jokes. My self-esteem is low, and I think I’m unattractive and unwanted. Whenever there are team activities, I’m always seen as weak or left out when others pick their teams. My parents favor my lighter-skinned brother, which makes me feel unloved and constantly compared unfairly.

In my native country, it was no better. My kindergarten teacher used to make fun of me and physically abuse me so severely that it lasted for years until I moved to the UK at 14. The teachers there shamed and physically abused me for minor reasons, but where I lived, this treatment was normal. My parents were also harsh; they would beat me severely for even the smallest mistakes, never giving me a chance to learn. My so-called friends used to mock my appearance, calling me ugly and making me feel worthless. Now, at my age, people make fun of me because I’m still a virgin. It’s led me to smoke and drink beer, neglecting my self-care and feeling like I don’t matter anymore.

I have always been labeled as weak and a failure, especially by my dad who constantly tells me I will never succeed. He looks at me with disappointment, seeing only failure. I’ve never achieved anything worthwhile; I feel like a coward and stupid too. Exams and assessments were always my worst nightmare; I consistently received the lowest marks. In group discussions, no one liked me because of my language barrier; they often ignored me or skipped over me altogether. I’m scared to become an adult because I feel too weak, and I worry that I’ll end up alone. These thoughts weigh heavily on me, making me doubt my ability to handle adulthood.Oh and btw lm black 
l just feel like humanity has failed soo badly
Laughing at each other because of different skin colours it’s just stupid l wish for a better future 
l just wanna  Kms 
Hopefully l get peace

Crazy? ," Crazy-? 

 I’ve been an outcast my entire life. In my family, with friends, school, anywhere I go it feels like I’m pinned against a wall. They look at me as if I’m not human- my mom said she could tell someone I’m special needs and they wouldn’t question it, she has to understand that’s hurtful right?

Growing up I was outgoing and loud, in my family I was categorized with my cousin, we were “the weird kids”, my cousins would make fun of him when he wasn’t around and I know they did the same with me. They have called me childish for as long as I can remember, but obviously I was childish I was a fucking child. As I grew up I got quieter, anxious and terrified of disappointing people. I had some not so great relationships and friendships that made me feel crazy. I was 12 when these things started happening, dated someone that was not good for me to say the least. Started hurting myself in 7th grade because of them, broke up after almost  5 months and I spent the next 2 years yearning for their attention, for them to love me the way I loved them. They used me to take out all there anger, they were so nice when we met, an amazing friend but as soon as we dated they became hurtful and cold. Treated everyone around me kindly and me like total shit. A couple months after we broke up I got close to him, a person I can’t bare to see. He laughs and makes gag noises when he sees me as if I was the problem- he lied to me through our entire relationship, made up people and story’s. Told me that he had certain things in his closet, hurtful things- said his dad hit him and even made up 3 fake friends to trick me into things. I knew he was lying I’m not an idiot but I “loved” him. We were on and off for months and I honestly can’t remember all the horrible things he made me do because they are so far repressed into my mind. I remember one night in particular tho, I wish I could forget it- I was at his house and we were hanging out having a good time, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and told me he wanted to “try something” he gave me the knife and took off his shorts and told me to cut him. he said that he was into it and when I said I didn’t want to he said I didn’t love him. He claimed I had been lying to him and if i loved him id do it, so I took the knife and did what he said-  to make it even worse this little girl from across the street was there, he had her sit in the closet before it happened. she was 9, a fucking 9 year old. he's the one that made my self harm even worse, he made me start vaping, drinking, made me do things- he used to claim that he couldn't kiss me because of his braces which obviously I knew was a lie but I was to scared to ask him why he really wouldn't kiss me- ofc now i know its because he never actually loved me. one of the last nights i was at his house was the worst tho, he had made me do so many things before that night and i knew what was next. I had never had sex with anyone before, people talk about how there first time was special or amazing but mine was horrible- so horrible i barley remember it, he didn't want to touch me he only wanted me to touch him as he had the entire relationship. I didn't want to but I did because I thought he'd fall in love with me somehow. after that night we broke up completely and haven't talked since. No one knows about the things that happened with him, no one cares- we only broke up because the first abusive partner texted me, they said they loved me and wanted to be with me so I ended it with him. A week or two later they decided they hated me again, them along with my other “friend” texted me they hated me that new years along with a lot of other messages about how horrible I was, and both blocked me. A month later the other friend reached out and we began talking again, then my ex also reach out and everything was “fine” I started dating this person during that time, they were sweet but also not and our relationship didn’t last long because that February my ex texted me again. They came over and we had a night that we called “long hug night” we sat in my room and hugged for hours not saying anything, we were high and crying and we felt close. They said they wanted to kiss me but since I was dating someone I told them it couldn’t happen. A week later on April fools night I broke up with my boyfriend to be with them and a week after that they got cold again- we stopped talking after I yelled at them for doing that again and a month later I found out they were dating my friend. During all of this the ex-friend that joined my ex in hating on me for new years had gotten rather close to me, I found out they liked me and one Wednesday at a friends house we kissed. The next week he came over and we had a great time, at one point we kissed again and made out which from my knowledge was completely ok because he didn’t tell me he didn’t want to and we had kissed the week before. 3 days later I found out he told a bunch of our friends that I sexually assaulted him. Everyone was against me and I lost almost all of my friends over a lie- I have been SA and I would never do that to someone else. Back to the girl and my ex though, I only found out they were together because they broke up and after they did I felt bad for my friend and asked if she wanted to see a movie with me to cheer her up, we got close and started dating and I bet you know we’re this leads. She claimed to be a “lesbian” but since I am trans and identify as a male she wasn’t one, she got mad at me for mentioning top surgery and continued to say she was lesbian while dating a trans man. After a bit I lost connection because of this and I broke up with her and 2 months later on October 1st to 6th my sister got in a car accident and died. She was 16, and I was 14. I couldn’t believe it- ofc during this that ex-friend that cost me nearly all of my friends showed up again, he apologized for the things he said and told people and wanted to be friends again. Since we had mutual friends we got closer and I thought it was behind us until he got cold months later and screamed at me. During the October my sister died I got close to this girl, scarlet, she was kind and sweet and she dressed up as Garfield for Halloween. That December we kissed while watching tinkerbell and started dating January 15th 2023. I have nothing bad to say about her because it’s currently july 14th 2024 and our year and a half is tomorrow. I love her more than worlds can describe. 

But even with the girl I want to marry someday I still feel crazy. I hate myself more than I thought possible and everyday is weighing on me. Although to everyone else around me it looks like nothings happening I’m crumbling. Struggling to wake up each morning and not scream at myself. I have diagnosed ADHD and anxiety along with so many other issues that are tearing me apart. My girlfriend thinks I have an eating disorder, people I’ve talk to think I have autism or am bipolar, and everyone else thinks I’m crazy. I’m 16 man- I’m just a kid. All I can think about is how badly I hate everything I do. I have no dreams, no future plans, no hope. I’m terrified of driving, I don’t have a job, I have nothing. It feels like everyone hates me, and if they don’t now they will. I can’t stop hurting myself or getting high or eating to much or starving myself. I know change starts with me and no one else can fix this but I don’t know how to. I’m a fat, ugly, tranny that my parents don’t even want. They want their little girl but she died a long time ago and if they’re not careful they’ll lose their boy too. I’m this close to ending it all, I can’t keep living like this. I’m tired of carrying this burden, I’m tired of being such a burden to people that I love. I can’t stop being terrible, it feels like that’s all I’ve ever been. Like I deserve everything that’s happened to me- I’m suicidal, homicidal, and I need real help that I can’t get. I wish for something horrible to happen to me because just maybe they’ll care and realize I wasn’t fucking playing around.

Feeling so lost,"I’m a 39/f and recently had my first child. My relationship with my partner has become increasingly more strained since our child was born. My partner does not have to do much for our child, as I do it all. I do expect some help every now and then, but I do 99% of the childcare. I have not worked since June 1, so I’m totally dependent on my partner, though I can get a job in my field but would need to pay out several hundred dollars for up to date licensures and other necessities, which I currently don’t have. My partner tends to get into these moods where they stay aggravated and frustrated for hours to days. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells, like I can’t live in my own home. My partner also gets frustrated when they have the baby and the baby cries or can’t settle. I’ve explained that this is just the baby right now and we have to take the good with the bad. 
I finally asked my partner what I could do to make things easier or better, because I cannot handle walking on eggshells when they won’t communicate with me. My partner said that it sounds like I want it to end because I do everything and they do nothing. I never said that and I never said I wanted it to end, but that is their go to Everytime I try to voice a concern. 

I have no money of my own, the house is mine but I couldn’t afford the mortgage alone right now, let alone the rest of the bills and stuff for my child. 

If this ends, I will have my partner take the baby to their family’s to visit and I will kill myself. It seems like the easiest solution and then I’d be out of this misery. I love my child but I cannot live life like this. I just want it all to end.

"31m, do I even have a chance at life anymore","I've really been trying fix my life

I've made so many mistakes and at times I feel like I'm not good at anything.

I wasn't good in school

I tried going into the military. To get college money, try to get motivated into being a better person, get into better shape, and have time to figure out what I wanna do in life.

Reality wise, I wasn't good at it, was even more depressed and fell into a cycle of barely passing my fitness while also getting more demotivated and still had no idea what I wanted out of life.

So after 4 years I knew I wasn't a good fit for this role and would have eventually been kicked out so I wanted get out, get a regular paying security guard gig as a temporary thing to do something easy while I figure things out.

fast forward 6 years later, mediocre pay with a crappy job and I'm not any closer to figuring out my life than I was at 18 when it was time to get a job and try to make something of my life.

So I asked my dad for some advice. He gave me a couple ideas, one leading into HVAC technician.

Seemed like something I could get into.

I used my GI bill, went to school, got training and everything seemed great. Then I tried applying to jobs but no one would hire me

Got a job at Circle K maintenance, cause they made it seem like they needed people with experience in plumbing, electrician, and HVAC. But reality wise I'm not doing anything HVAC related (they keep telling me they wanna do that eventually but I don't know if eventually is 5 months or 5 years)

So after 6 months of being a glorified janitor, I try applying for other jobs again

Got an interview for an actual HVAC company only to find out how little I actually know of the field and how much competition there actually is.

Its gotten to the point where any choice I make I feel like I'll never make something of myself, I feel like no matter what I do I keep fucking up and keep failing

I feel like no matter how many times I try to climb out of this hole, the hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper and I just keeping slipping to the bottom.

And what if I get into the HVAC industry and I'm not even good at it, like how I'm not good at anything.

I don’t have it in me to perform how I feel all the time,"I feel like I’m constantly doing what I feel like a normal human should be doing. I consume so much social media and watch so much tv that idk what’s real and what’s a performance anymore. What is performative friendship and what’s real anyway? I feel truly like it’s all a performance like I genuinely feel like a character in a show trying to keep everyone entertained. I know I should have friends and a partner and I should keep trying to be presentable but everything just feels like this huge chore and I’m constantly trying to pretend it isn’t. I think art and life is one and the same because some people find joy in the act while for others the artificial nature of it makes it unenjoyable. I don’t have fun pretending people’s up and down behavior is amusing and generally people are more aggravating than anything. I find people exhausting because of how unpredictable they are. I can’t just be me because of course I get what it’s like on the receiving end and for that reason alone I must be kind.

I must constantly set aside my own needs and respond to people even though I find it utterly boring. I think to have any sort of amusement in life you have to be somewhat selfish. The happiest people I met were complete assholes who put themselves above everything. An ex friend of mine would never consider suicide and had so much love for life she couldn’t have it in her to have empathy for someone who doesn’t. It must be easy for someone like her who forgives and forgets so easily and steps all over the things I enjoy. She showed little interest in what I enjoyed and had the nerve to say that I HAD THE POWER in the friendship. 

I had the power yet I constantly bent myself backwards trying to be a good friend showing interest in what she liked yet she treated me like a complete ghost and I was just another person for her to collect. This is how optimistic people are, they think miserable people are a burden and the mere presence of unhappiness is a threat on their wellbeing. Me just being my true authentic self is a threat on people and they feel uncomfortable. They think I’m stupid for caring about the wellness of human beings and society. They think I’m weak for watching the news and being personally emotionally affected by things. Feeling sadness at the plight of others is seen as a weakness. I genuinely can’t live in a world where everyone is trying to get ahead by acting on their own selfish needs.

True empathy is extremely hard to come by and people who seemed like they had good intentions hurt me. They still act on their selfish desires and don’t care whether it’s what’s good or not. It’s like every waking moment I’m questioning everything I consume. The idea of being rich is enticing until I see how every rich person is out of touch to a certain degree. They try to be good people yet they participate in the exact thing that makes people hurt. You can’t exactly bend yourself for other’s needs but at the same time these people should quit pretending to be altruistic when in actuality they’re apart of the same competitive system as the rest of us. 

A true selfless act would be not participating in most things. It seems like no matter what I do I’m inadvertently hurting someone. I think I should just take the burden away from everyone by ending it all. Being human is being selfish inherently. We can say we want a change as much as we want and it does seem like humanity swings towards goodness. However that could possibly take a long time and the more idiots I have to face unfortunately the more suicidal I become.",paranoidandnoid,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4dsja/i_dont_have_it_in_me_to_perform_how_i_feel_all/
For the Record.,"I'm going to kill myself and I'd like to post my suicide note here; I have it in writing but I'd like to have it somewhere where it is widely available to read. I'm really sorry and I wish things could be different. I really do.

To Whom It May Concern,

I'd like to start off by saying that what I end up doing was nobody's fault; this was the a decision that was the result of a lot of different factors. I will sum things up by saying that my life was not one that anyone would ever want to live. Sure, bad things happen to everyone--but I am inadequate. In every facet of existence I fall short of the mark. I have no talents, I am alone even when I'm around others, I have no drive to attempt things because I know that I will fail. I used to love writing (it is what is driving me to write this) but I have come to realize that this thing I loved was merely just a way to avoid the loneliness of my reality--the sadness that nothing will get better; I was just as bad at it as everything else unfortunately. I was not made for life. It is a strange statement, but one I know to be true. If I were anyone else I'd be happy and not writing this. Some people are given bad lives, but those people can overcome them and go on to have wonderful lives. I am not one of these people; once I drew that short straw my fate was sealed. Some people are just not meant to be born.

For awhile I thought things were getting better; in 2019 I had a job that I loved, friends that I cared for and that I believe cared for me, and a family situation that was pleasant enough. Right around this time, when things were looking up, the pandemic hit and things became the worst they'd ever been. My job (one in the medical field) fell into chaos and deteriorated my mental state further; eventually we were bought out and I had to quit. My mother also went missing around this time while camping and they have still not found a trace of her. In the aftermath of the pandemic my friends drew away from me and now it is as if I do not exist to them. I wanted to go to school, but this too the pandemic prevented. If this had not happened I think things could have been bearable for a little while longer.

Every day that I lived was a trail and I was always overcome with a sense of loneliness and despair. I felt that life was a prison and I didn't know how to escape or why I was even in this prison. Some people may ask what my problems were or offered advice, but this could never help in anyway because they could not understand what I feel every day--they did not have to endure the pain that life caused me. It was never about the problems--not at its core; these only served to heighten this pain. The only time I ever felt free was when I was sleeping, only there was I free of the pain, in my dreams. Dreams of a better existence, surrounded by people that wanted me around, of experiences I could never have in the waking world. My sleep was a reality of love, of warmth and belonging, and it is my hope that I'll return there in a more permanent capacity. That was the only place that my hopes were made manifest. You may not understand anything I'm saying, nothing I'm describing, and if that's the case then it is good news! Because you are not feeling what I am feeling and I am very glad for that.

I'm sure I sound crazy, but no therapist could have helped, even if I could have afforded it (which I could not). I understand the function of SSRIs and of the chemical imbalance that occurs in those with depression. I do not have depression, these medications would not have worked; what I had was a terminal outlook on life and a ceaseless soul-crushing anguish. There are people like me who cannot be helped, no matter how hard you try: it is an effort in futility. Please know that no amount of help could have changed my decision, and please do not blame yourselves for this, because it was well out of your control.

I could ask for your forgiveness, but a complete waste like me does not deserve it. I understand if you hate me, that is something I do deserve. I've tried to better myself, I've tried to help others, but nothing I do truly matters. I'm just so tired of everything. I know that I'm leaving a lot of stuff behind, just do with it as you please, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience that this causes you. For that, I am a horrible person.

"I’ve been struggling with my mental health, I don’t want to go back to work and just done with life.","Sorry I just needed to rant because my have nowhere else to turn to.

I am struggling massively with my mental health, to the point of just feeling exhausted and not present, I’m worn out and just done with everything, especially my job. I’m just feeling so lost and a failure in life and it weighs on me.

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for years now, but I’m very high functioning and very good at hiding it,so on the outside, I look perfectly ok, but I just feel like I’m unrevealing now and I don’t even know where to begin to pick up the pieces. I’ve e had counselling and CBT which helped but I still struggle so deeply, I’ve never had medication, I don’t know what to do. My GP is aware of my struggles and put me on the waitlist for NHS talking therapy, but I still on the list.

I dread my job, I work in the public sector/local government in education so it’s very high pressure, heavy caseload. I’ve handed in my notice which is 3 months from now, so I will be leaving soon. I’m going to take a break from working and just focus on my studies and pursue my masters degree, so I haven’t completely left without something lined up.

But Irecently got a complaint from a parent that sent me in a downward spiral with my mental health and from that, I’ve not been right. A family member of mine passed away and that triggered it even further. I wasn’t given bereavement leave by my manager, so I’ve been calling in sick, I’ve been off work sick for a week already due to go back this week.

I have no one to turn to, my manager at work isn’t helpful, she’s lovely but she doesn’t know how to support me whenever I mention I struggle with my mental health. There is no signposting to services that can help at my workplace, there is no ‘how can I help,’ nothing. She isn’t mean, but I dread engaging with her about it. 

My family are not the best to talk about these things so I keep it to myself.

I don't want to live but I don't want to kill myself and I feel like my situation doesn't justify those feelings.,"I live a perfectly good life, with loving parents and a lot of friends. From the outside there is nothing wrong with my life. Nothing to justify these feelings I'm feeling. The thing about me is that I can't get work done, nor can I focus on anything. This has led to a lot of arguments with my parents, who are more traditional so they wouldn't understand if I told them that I just can't focus, or can't do all my homework. It's hard to explain what I mean. Lately they've spent a lot of money on a summer math course and Invisalign for me. I'm talking like thousands. But my stupid ass can't be consistent, and I stop wearing the Invisalign and doing the math course. I KNOW its important for me to do, but I CANT do them from some reason. Its like a unbeatable laziness that I can't overcome. I just end up slacking off at the end, or thinking to myself I'll do it tomorrow. It's horrible and I hate it and I know its bad but I just can't stop it. I just don't wanna do anything anymore. This has led to my Invisalign being cancelled because the dentist just think I don't wanna wear it anymore, my parents STILL have to pay full price even if im not wearing it and I can tell they are just dissapointed in me. But I can't explain to them the situation I am in of not wanting to do anything because I can't explain to myself either. Its just this looming overwhelming feeling of just not wanting to do anything and turn off my brain to scroll on instagram all day. With my traditionalist parents of course they blame everything on my phone, meaning they think that because I'm on my phone I don't do any work, which is what it is exactly at face value. But they don't know plus won't understand that even without my phone I wouldn't want to do these thing EVEN though I know how important they are. I can't explain why and I hate myself for it. I just want to stop living and disregard all these things so this constant battle in my brain would stop. But I also don't want to kill myself because I know that would devastate my parents and since I'm from a Christian household, be against the faith. Plus it's not like my life is horrible and compared to other people, why would anyone want to kill themselves if they were in my shoes? If I were to die in my sleep tomorrow I would be fine with it, im scared what would happen to my parents who already have a shaky relationship and my little sister though. But on the flip side I don't know how much longer I can continue this mental battle of not wanting to do anything but needing to do it, which ends up in, me forcing myself to do it and feeling miserable while doing it. I feel like im wasting money, time, and taking my parents patience and love for granted, and I don't know how to explain this to my parents. So i'm here ranting it out seeing what ygs have to say. Sorry if it's a bit confusing or messy I kinda just typed thoughts as they popped up.

Stressed out about something that might’ve happened and I’m having suicidal thoughts again because of it.,"
CW: Possible pedophilia 

I just remembered something that happened when I was about 13 years old and it’s stressing me out. I think I walked in on my little sister (who would’ve been about 11 at the time) masturbating to a picture of out step - nephew who would’ve been a toddler then. Or I just saw the photo of him on my sister’s phone, there was no nudity in the pic or anything explicitly sexual, it just looked like my sister found a regular photo of him and zoomed in on his butt and screenshotted it. I don’t really remember this and I don’t know for sure if it was him but I do remember finding other pictures on her phone of similar things that she found on google but they were adults. I told her and our youngest brother about these other photos and she said she just thought they were funny or something (I think) and I thought it was funny too. But I sometimes sort of remember walking in on her masturbating to one of the photos but I honestly can’t remember any of this clearly and it’s stressing me out so much. 

I’m 17 and she’s 16 now and she’s never really expressed attraction to children, she did say sort of recently that Sheldon from young Sheldon was cute but not in like a weird way. But what if she did actually have a picture of our step - nephew and she had it for sexual reasons? What am I supposed to do? I remember worrying about this a little while back but I stopped for some reason, I think I stopped worrying about it because I couldn’t remember how old the child looked in the picture and thought it was someone close to her age at the time (which it still might be because I can’t remember). If that did actually happen, I don’t think I could bring myself to tell my mom and I don’t know if she’d actually do something about it anyway. I’ve told her that me and my sibling are likely struggling with mental health issues before and she just ignored it.

How does everyone feel so much?,"What I can’t understand is how people have such strong feelings. They have the motivation to get up, to feed and clothe and wash themselves, to go to a job, to heal themselves when they’re ill. And the people who are suicidal - they feel hate towards themselves, or the world, or sadness.

I just feel nothing. I look at the world and I just think what is inspiring about that. I have no idea why the average person gets up in the morning because I am one of them and none of this feels worth trying for to me. It all just feels so pointless - it’s so much effort to stay alive and for what exactly? A boring world full of boring mundane days and tasks, the same social interactions over and over. I just don’t care? 

I feel like people expect depression to be strong feelings of sadness but I wish I could feel that because I don’t even gaf enough to look after myself. I just think the world is overrated in the same way you might look at a supermarket offer and think “not good value for money”. 

I’m alive for my family but that’s their feelings, not mine - I think staying alive for the potential of a few specific happy moments is just illogical when the rest are shit. ",absolutethrowaway77,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2rm6s/how_does_everyone_feel_so_much/

Need suggestion for choosing the right AD ,"
Helo, in short, i have tinnitus, OCD and OCD induced pretty bad anxiety which resulted in GERD - vomiting every morning.

I have taken one pill of 5 mg escitalopram, but that resulted in slight serotonine syndrome (psych. told me it could be it)- feeling hotness in my face (red face for two days), arms and legs, flu-like feeling, nausea, severe dry mouth, headache, sinutisis ect.

I also experienced pretty bad hyperacusis that lasted for a week whilst strongest for two days and then gradually dissapearing. Thank god it did not cause more tinnitus.

Do you think the serotinine syndrom could cause hyperacusis?

Now I am taking Lavender 80 mg for two weeks, but I am feeling that my previous symptoms are getting worse, but I have not vomited for two weeks.

I am currenty deciding between two possibilities: Mirtizapine or Vortioxetine (reccomended by psych.)

Do you think that Vortioxetine could result in simmilar experience as escitalopram did? It is pretty new and I did not read it can cause tinnitus (there are few cases)

Mirtizapine - I read some cases of tinnitus (not much), hearing loss (one case) and many cases of hard time with withdrawall.

My biggest concerns are my current tinnitus cannot be worsened or new one created and hyperacusis connot be created.",Accurate_Date_5840,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4svn5/need_suggestion_for_choosing_the_right_ad/
Can I Please Leave Now? I can’t go on,"Was SA’d as a kid. Years later, it came back to me and the self loathing began. Diagnosed with ADHD, depression, etc. I sought help. For years I have held on for my family. Therapy. Exercise. Eating better. I moved abroad. I don’t think I deserve to be alive. 

I’ve never told anyone about my assault. I never would. I don’t get anything out of it and they’d just be burdened with useless information. 

I stayed because I didn’t want people to think school or finding a job made me suicidal. I submitted my thesis and I’m graduating. I got some job offers. So can I please go now? My work is done here. 

I thought people wanted to help. They didn’t. They just wanted to feel better about themselves. Some close friends even ghosted me after I mentioned being suicidal. Some don’t believe it. “How can you be depressed but still go to the gym? Or find a job? You’re okay man, don’t be so negative!”. “You gotta ask Ok_Currency_2464, they’re the drug addict here.” It used to bother me. Now I just avoid people altogether. 

I’m a hypocrite myself. I’m afraid of trying new medications because of how I see myself already. A drug addicted helpless idiot who has everybody convinced they’re smart. And I’m okay with others being queer, but I really hate that I myself could be asexual. I feel bad if I show the slightest hint that I’m not ok. If I tell my sister she’d pray for me. My father didn’t get my hints, thought I was joking. My mom, well, she’s literally the sweetest person I have known. I can’t let her know how I feel. 

So I’m done. I’m canceling my appointments. My meetings. I’ve deleted messaging apps from my phone. I don’t deserve to be here, and the world is too cruel to deserve me either. My self loathing finally overcame my love for others. 


I can’t swim. And the knife is sharp enough to help me go. I’ve surveyed the bodies of water closest to me. I hope I’m brave enough to make it. And maybe someday you’ll find this.

How to Overcome the Fear of Abandonment?,"I have been trying to overcome it for a long time, but the thing is that since I was little, I have felt abandoned many times. By friends, family, and ex-partners.

I more or less managed to overcome the eating disorder, but this is the most complicated thing. I don't want to be afraid of being abandoned, but every time someone tells me they won't, they end up leaving.

I feel very tired and mentally exhausted because of this, and I really wish I could stop being afraid, but just today it happened again with a now ex.",SapoFroggy1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3zshr/how_to_overcome_the_fear_of_abandonment/
Sexual dysfunction on SSRI,"Hello

Currently I'm considering psychopharmacology and wanted to ask you about your own experience with any libido changes on ssri. Was it really meaningful for you? Has it came back to natural level just after the end of therapy or did it need more time? I am just kinda starting new relationship with girl and I'm worried that possible side effects can affect development of it. 

Thank you for all your answers ",U_ff,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4v78w/sexual_dysfunction_on_ssri/

I really don’t want this life.,"After being sexually abused by a family member at age 4-7(male30now), watching my parents fight every day because my father verbally emotionally and physically abused my mother I to have picked up on these bad traits. I never was able to make friends easily my entire life as I’ve always felt I was “different” or strange compared to everyone else. I’ve always secluded myself from normal behaviors as a child teen and an adult. After finally reaching out seeking the proper diagnosis that I was hoping for (BPD) I’ve come to realize how toxic and abusive I have been to my past three partners. My fiancé of 7 years finally decided to leave me and couldn’t even tell me I was emotionally abusive to her. I didn’t realize I was hurting her that way until now. I’m not sure how I can cope with the amount of trauma I’ve caused her, she is such a sweet loving gentle and caring person who never deserved that. But still she accepted it. I always told myself I would be nothing like my father or his but here I stand. They may have been worse but I can’t sit here and be okay with what I’ve done. My life has been flipped upside down but it’s for her best interest. Every single day this past month and a half since we split and I left our house we bought and repaired I just can’t handle who I am anymore. I don’t think I can change. My grandfather died alone because he was an abusive POS and passed that down to my father and then me. I realize I can just be alone but to me that’s not a life worth living. My thoughts are too angry and violent but yet I want nothing but peace happiness and love for everyone. I want my ex to be happy. I never hit her or verbally abused her but emotional abuse is in secret and it’s hard to spot.

"No matter what I do, I still hate myself.","I've had a horrible childhood and traumatic experiences so I was planning to off myself if my life in university was bad, too. I ended up not going through with it.

Now, I'm going to graduate next year. Technically, I am the top of my year. So, academically,I'm doing well. My family life is better than it used to be. I have a long term relationship. I lost friends, but I got even better ones later on. Even though I'm a student, I worked at several places that are HUGE boosts to my resume.

Yet, I still hate myself. I sit down at night and I think I'm not good enough, that I've never been. This summer I tried to learn book writing and screenwriting. I completed some courses. Yesterday I started to work out intensively even thought I'm of average weight. (Have to note that I'm hurting myself by working out because I have a heart problem.)

These are great achievements to other people but STILL, I feel like I'm not enough. People tell me they'd do anything to be as 'smart' as me but I can't take them seriously because I think I'm not good enough. This is causing me to make decisions that will harm me physically AND mentally.

Suicidal thoughts comforting in everyday life,"I was scrolling through this sub a few months ago and tried to take my life and failed. I was unemployed for a year, barely no friends, just broke up with my partner, absolutely nothing going for me. I have never felt this low. I was one of those people that couldn’t understand people actually going through with it until I did. 

I woke up one day and started looking for jobs and would tell myself “if I don’t find one I can just kill myself” then I went to a mental health professional to get meds for suicidal thoughts, I told myself “if these meds don’t work I’ll kill myself” they worked to subside my suicidal thoughts about 75%. I got a job offer and told myself “if I hate this job I’ll kill myself.” I didn’t hate the job, don’t love it tho

Does anyone else do the same to keep going?

don’t know how to keep playing this game ,"turning 20 made me realize that i’ve been depressed with almost no relief for 10 years. i first went to therapy when i was 10 and started back up when i was a junior in high school. for the remainder of high school, i did therapy 2-3 times a week for most of the time. i tried holistic supplements and eventually had to go on antidepressants when i started college. im on my 4th combination and i had to stop bc they made me more suicidal than before.  i was looking forward to the change, but i never really made any lasting friends besides my roommate who i am still very thankful for. my sophomore year, i decided to live in a dorm alone bc i thought it would give me more time alone to do practice my guitar and write. it was just far from my classes and everyone i met. by october of last year, i decided to drop out. i burnt myself out in high school and tried to go for a good degree in college but i couldn’t handle it. i did a 200 hour yoga teacher training bc i couldn’t let myself do nothing for the time i went home. got a job at a cafe too. i didn’t rest as much as i wanted to. yoga became a chore instead of a method to help me cope, and now i have extreme anxiety around teaching and everyone is expecting me to start now. i signed a lease that i can’t escape and im moving back to my college town. everyone is excited for me but i can’t find a way to be hopeful. every time ive tried to be, i still end up in the same situation. i’m always the odd one out. i was at least excited to live by my boyfriend, but he’s moving for a job and we will have to be long distance still. outside of my personal life i feel like i have so much awareness around how rigged the world is. i will never be rich enough to afford my basic necessities bc i don’t dream of having a job. there’s not much i feel passionate about besides music and i don’t feel i can succeed enough to make money. i feel like ill be stuck working these stupid low wage service jobs forever. i feel like my life is over. i feel even worse thinking about how all my mom wants is a happy and healthy kid. the peace i got earlier when i was driving on the highway, listening to “telephone line” by ELO on full blast thinking about driving into a wall at full speed was the closest to happiness ive felt. i know i will traumatize people by killing myself so i just pray that i get a terminal illness. don’t know if anyone will read this but i just haven’t been able to go to therapy bc of my job and don’t feel like i can be honest with anyone else",Desperate-Bug6959,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e45grh/dont_know_how_to_keep_playing_this_game/

The thoughts are back.,"Long story short I attempted suicide by hanging myself two years ago. I got on medication and changed my lifestyle around. In the two years I met someone I really love and moved in with them. Things have recently been rocky in our relationship and I am in debt. I feel lost, I am not being the partner I want to be. I know I won't be able to go through with it this time. I can't abandon my family. My new one or my parents and siblings. I don't want to give my debt to others. 

I can't stop thinking about how peaceful and freeing it would be to stop existing. Hoping I won't wake up, thoughts of how selfish those thoughts are. I know I'll make it through this. I have coping skills now. But the thought loops and spirals are back. Even with therapy.  I don't know if I can talk about this with my therapist because I know I won't go through with it and I can't afford to be sent to the psych ward right now. I'm just venting. I keep mourning the child inside me. That I've failed them somehow.

 That kid with a lot of promise who wanted a fun job and to be able to take care of my family without these toxic traits. I'm in a hole and I'm trying to dig myself out. To be who that child wanted to be. I owe it to them. Go back to college, have my own family. Be able to be a trustworthy parent and partner. Be a pillar of my community. Trying to take it one day at a time but I feel this country has failed it's citizens and I have failed as a human being.

It really never ends,"Just when I thought I had gotten better I get down to my lowest. All the inconveniences and problems just add up and suddenly I'm trying to numb my pain with binge drinking again. I try to keep myself occupied but most forms of entertainment just don't do it for me anymore. I recently started exercising again but the days where I really struggle I just can't bring myself to do anything but lay around and get drunk, its really the only time life feels bearable. 

Something a lot of people don't talk about is how hard it is to maintain or gain new relationships as an adult. Slowly all my friends have begun to drift apart not always for bad reasons but just the paths life takes you. There's probably two or three people I could really consider a friend but they don't live close and live busy lives so its hard to talk or see them regularly. I tried dating but I had so many bad experiences I just don't wanna subject myself to that torture anymore. 

I wouldn't consider myself suicidal anymore but the loneliness has really begun to eat me up. Some days I'm alright but other days it feels like I'm hanging on by a thread. I feel like I should be in therapy again but I have no insurance and couldn't afford that since I'm currently in the middle of trying to land a new job. So for now the cheap vodka will have to do.

There is nothing we can say to her that'll make her feel better. She does not want to get out of the house but always complains about the house closing in on her. She always has a pain in her chest and has trouble breathing, she has also complains that she doesn't recognise herself anymore. She doesn't pick up any calls by her friends and family.

How can we help her? It has been three years of this behaviour on and off, she has not genuinely laughed in past three years. Please help us we are desperate.

it says to consider the death penalty for child sexual abusers. that's one thing. but when you consider that trans people are porn for existing and thus any child seeing a trans person would be ""exposed to porn""... yeah. 

the rest is a whole other can of worms that make me want to kms slightly less

i don't think most of you guys can understand what it's like to be despised and to have people want you dead and burning in hell and people praying for your downfall and to have the government take away your rights and lock you up/kill you. just for existing and helping yourself. for being different. be afraid walking alone. you shouldn't have to and i don't want you to. nobody should have to understand that.

i'm mentally ill with diagnosed depression, ptsd, agoraphobia, insomnia, and am on a cocktail of 5 meds that i can't live without. straight up can't sleep without one of them. last year i had to up my dosage on one 

i've considered moving to australia/nz but i'd be uprooting my whole life. i'd be so far away from my family and friends and time zones would mess up communication. then there's the visa process; i can't even go there without a visa. then what the hell am i gonna do about my medications? i can maybe go a day or two without most of them but i need my insomnia one daily

then what about study? i'm taking community college atm with plans to transfer to my state's most well known university and am admitted to it though not taking classes

the reason i am considering moving to australia/nz is work. there are some great resources for my interests connected to my major. i don't think canada offers that

in the past i have been able to talk myself out of it including guilting myself out of it. i've set goals to at least wait until whatever series i'm interested in ends but things are so bad i'm probably gonna end up ruling it out. i've been able to do that for around 10 years at this point but things are getting that bad

i've partially written a note but not a main one. been thinking of writing a full one just to get it out even if i don't do anything

i'm not really a direct danger to myself right now even if i am thinking of these things but i don't know how long that will last. whenever i think of doing my preferred method i always see myself telling someone and going to the hospital before anything super bad happens to me.

"I'm a 17-year-old male, and I feel completely withdrawn and disconnected from myself, as if I'm living life on autopilot. I feel like I'm in a constant state of being detached from my body, thoughts and surroundings, experiencing amnesia, and feeling like my ego is dead.","**Need To Talk / Vent**

Throwaway account. I need to express what I'm going through because I'm exhausted from living like this without anyone truly understanding. My mind is essentially in a permanently blank, withdrawn, depersonalised and dissociative slate, as if I'm watching my life as a movie, drifting through it on autopilot. Everything and everyone around me feels lifeless and foggy. I feel completely detached from my body and surroundings, as if I'm not really alive. It's hard to explain, but everything feels disconnected and distant. It's like living in a permanent state of amnesia, where I'm detached from my own body, lacking thoughts, memories, or a sense of identity like some sort of ego death that never ends. This has severely impacted my social abilities; I have nothing to say or express anymore. I feel numb, empty, and permanently withdrawn. Trying to have a simple conversation with me is like trying to get blood from a stone. I feel utterly hopeless, constantly sad, and sometimes, it feels like I'm not real.

I became very depressed about a year ago, and my cognitive abilities just dwindled overtime. I started just staying in my room all the time, sleeping and doing nothing else, and my memories started to decline, and my brain was probably not being stimulated or processing much information as it should. I feel crazy writing this. I feel completely alone, withdrawn and there's just nothing going on inside of my head anymore. Am I going crazy? Am I going I mentally insane? It took me a long time come up this post because my situation is so complicated, bizarre, and difficult to explain. I've done my best to express how I feel.

I feel completely hopeless and unable to explain my situation to medical professionals. When I try, I just sit in silence, unable to convey my problems because I'm literally zoned out of myself. I have nothing to say or express, and my mind is just empty because I'm entirely withdrawn from myself.

**Time at College**

I have fortunately been doing well at college and have been studying hard, but I can't explain anything about what I do there because I'm permanently zoned out and withdrawn the entire time I'm on campus. I am in a constant dream-like state and don't really think about anything. I don't take in or process much information while at college; I only learn when I get home and view the slides and take study notes. I do not converse or speak with others at all. I stay by myself at all times and avoid any social interaction. I am incapable of having basic conversations because absolutely nothing is happening in my mind. I have nothing to say or express, and trying to find something to say is very difficult. I can't make an effort to find something to say because my mind is an empty void.



I feel so lost and alone; I want to be like other people. It took me a long time to write this reddit post, and even as I typed, I felt withdrawn and can't really recall what I've talked about.

Time goes by incredibly quickly,"I have a ""job"" that doesn't require knowing the day of the week, however, ever since I realized that I was rather depressed, I have realized how quickly time passes. I blink and it's several hours later. I start feeling down at night and it's the morning, I'm moaning about the hot weather where I am and then it's winter. I remember in school when the hours would drag, now an hour feels like seconds. 

It's also hard because I can't recall what I did a week prior, things just seem to go by so quickly, I have an incredibly busy life with my job and things just pass by constantly without me being able to remember what happened previously.

It's so saddening and concerning that my life is going by faster and faster, unable to do anything about it. It worries me deeply ",RealLordMiles,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2j043/time_goes_by_incredibly_quickly/
I wish my brain can stop from thinking for a minute.,"I am currently on vacation out of school. This past month, I have been feeling suffocated with myself and my thoughts and don't know how to overcome it. I barely have any friends and we don't even talk that much, although I have someone whom I consider as a friend and we talk through the internet, I just still somehow feel so alone and just don't feel any warmth and love from anyone.

I feel so ridiculous and useless when it comes to household chores. The only long conversation that I had with my mom was her yelling at me because I just do no help in the house. My brother is more close with my mom and to honestly tell you, I sometimes hate how he makes me feel. He'd somewhat start ganging up on me with my mom, and although not with verbal words, I can feel it. (I don't know how to explain this further). I know that I may sound immature to some for feeling this way, as yes, I don't do much work i n the house but I am trying... I can not justify this matter, but yelling at me, not doing any intimate talk about how I am doing is just what makes me unmotivated and to grow more avoidant with them, especially my mom. 

Being consumed in the internet and having the internet to make intimate talks with me probably wasn't good for my mental health and my whole being. I feel so alone, and knowing that school was my only distraction makes it worse. Waking up everyday. No distractions. I have been living on a loop for years now. The internet is the only thing that keeps me entertained, I'm paranoid for the fact that I'm going to feel this way for the rest of my life. I'm still young, and is in my early teenage years so I will still hold on for that hope it will get better. 

I don't know why I'm having thoughts like this. How do I stop? Am I just being dramatic for thinking this way, or are my thoughts valid?

Please help me to stop feeling this way.

On antidepressants since 2021 but nothing has changed,"My psychiatrist told me I was probably born depressed, meaning I have the tendency to feel this way and it’s true that i’ve been feeling depressed for most of my life.

There is a void inside me that will never be filled.,"I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember. Much of my life is spent alternating between passive acceptance of this and desperate attempts to fill it anyways. Sometimes it can be temporarily filled in good ways. Love helps. Compassion helps. My family, fiancée and dog help.

And yet the void remains. 

So I drink compulsively and I smoke too much because when I’m far enough gone I can forget I’m me. I do things I know are terrible for me. Because for just a little while the void is full, or at least I don’t notice its emptiness.

It’s a trap, of course. Numbing myself doesn’t help. Not really. Once I’m sober, I’m still me. Only, food tastes a little more like ashes in my mouth. Everything feels a more like I’m doing it wearing a weighted suit. I take even less joy from the good things in life. And I want another drink.

I don’t know why I’m like this. I’ve got some theories. Depression and substance abuse runs in the family. Childhood trauma possibly also plays a role. My first coherent memory is of a shooting I was in as a kid, with my mother grabbing me on her back to carry me away as quickly as possible. The sound of gunshots inside, the glare of the cheap mall lights. The dying boy bleeding out against a car. In any event, it probably didn’t help. 

I don’t think I want to die. It’s just hard to get worked up about going on living. That’s somewhat irrelevant. I’ve got people who need me. People who would be hurt if I left them. A dog that adores me. 

If I was alone in this universe I’d be free not to care if I live or die. But I’m not. So we continue. 

Because besides family, friends, pets…there’s her.

I love her in a way I hadn’t realized I was  capable of. And she loves me. She is sweet and kind and generous and good and she loves me.

Her life hasn’t been easy. She deserved better from the abusive family she doesn’t talk to anymore. She deserves better than me. But for some reason she wants me. For reasons beyond my comprehension she loves me. And I promised her a good life, with love and a real family and the adventures she never got growing up. So I’ll put in the work for her.

I will stop numbing the void and learn to accept it as part of me.

It’s going to be hard and I am afraid.

But it will be worth it. Because I love her and I want her to be happy. To be content. To take joy in life and leave it old and gray and with no regrets. And so I’ll do what I can to give that to her. I will quit drinking. I will give up smoking. I will wake up every day, and I will push through the emptiness and I will protect her and make her as happy as I can for as long as I can, for as long as she wants me. Sometimes I’ll be going through the motions of life. But I believe there will be moments that make me happy too. 

Or perhaps there won’t be. Not real happiness, of the kind I suspect I might have been capable of if I wasn’t…this. But if I can give her a joyful life lived without regrets, I will have done something worth doing with my life. And so I’ll focus on that. And the next time I want a drink, and every time after that, I’ll think about her and do my best to remind myself why I can’t.

I expect to always be depressed. But I think I can create space to exist within it, to make my peace with it. I can choose to feel the pain instead of numbing myself to it. And I will. My life is worth living and has a point because I say so. No matter how hard and scary that might be. 

If some of this is striking a cord with anyone reading it, I hope you find your reason to do your best. Maybe you’ll find a route to happiness through it. Hell, maybe I will. But even if not, there are still things worth doing with life. Hang in there and good luck.

no longer feel beautiful ,"between chronic illness and family issues, i haven’t felt beautiful or comfortable in my own skin for such a long time. it seems like such a terrible, vain thing to feel poorly about, but i feel like i used to be so much more confident and happy with my appearance. i think my personal relationships deteriorating have also contributed to this

i used to feel like i was someone worth talking to, someone people were excited to see, someone whose perspectives people valued. it really fucking hurts to think that to everyone in my life i’m just really fucking unnoticeable and nothing noteworthy. i never thought i was particularly special but i at least thought i had people who enjoyed my company or spirit. i feel really fucking stupid for thinking that now 

i’m really hoping my health issues take a turn for the worse really soon and put me out of my misery. i’m not going to be the same person if i recover, and who i would be is not someone i would be happy living as. every day i wake up and i hope it’s my last, everything is too much to keep going",caucasian_scammer,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4cpyq/no_longer_feel_beautiful/

When Will It End?,"I've been depressed since high school, and it seems I can't catch a break.

 I live with my step mother and step father in the literal middle of nowhere (my bio mom died in childbirth and then my bio dad remarried to my step mother and they both got custody of me, but then my dad died and my step mother got to keep custody and she remarried fairly recently) and I've been struggling with unemployment and housing crises due to serious health issues that have been ruining my life for five years.

I applied for disability (with my health issues, its a guarantee I'll get approved) in order to help with the unemployment, but it's taking forever to get back. I've been jobless for two years and my unemployment finally ran out this month.I have no car and the nearest town to get a job is 74 minutes away. I literally have no idea how I'm going to feed me or my cat for the next two weeks. 

I don't know how I'm doing anything or even operating at this point, to be honest. It's a lot worse than I'm going to reveal on Reddit to strangers, because, even though this is a throw away account, I feel so much shame in my current situation.

I don't know how much longer I can stay living with my step parents, because my step father makes all these sexual comments about my body and has even laid his hands on me on a couple of occasions, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I spend all day in my bedroom now and rarely leave except at night. At night I sneak down the hall to the kitchen and eat whatever little food I have left. I tried talking about it to my aunt (step mother's sister) about it, but she tried to sway me against it and she's the only other family member I have in contact with.

I have no friends here. I have no real support system. I'm just day in day out living with the chronic dread that I

1) am disabled

2) don't have a job/can't have a job

3) have to deal with my disgusting step father, and 

4) am cooped up in a bedroom all day in fear, because I don't want to even see my step father.

Mentally exhausted ,"I’ve lived a pretty isolated life, I was never physically abused but entirely emotionally neglected and strongly ignored by family my entire childhood (and most of my adulthood)

I was taken out of school at around 1st grade and my parents never put me back in so my education stopped there and I developed social anxiety and basically hid away in the run down bedroom at the back of our house all my childhood, I remember going days at a time never even seeing my family because of there work schedule and everyone just left me to my devices so I was alone there.

Around the age of 18 my father died and I kinda realized maybe I should try to do something with my life which started the long process of simply becoming a person, I straight didn’t even know how to tie my shoes till I was like 19, never needed to know and as kid it’s not like that was too on the to do list over playing PlayStation for instance.

I only ever learned spell half legibly because people in online games used to make fun of me for it and I got tired of it.

The point being I know nothing, I’ve done nothing, and I have no one.

I’ve been making a huge effort to be better, especially these last few years, I got a job I really like and wanted to learn more and do more in this field so I restarted my education, I got tired of being a fat piece of shit so I started trying to loose weight, I got tired of being alone so I started trying to date or just meet people who actually want to hear me speak or care about me in some way.

None of it’s really working, just kinda stagnating in stress of trying to do anything.

I turn 29 in less than a month and I’m just nothing, just here for no reason I don’t know if it’s worth the trouble of doing all this to maybe be a mediocre person when I am 40 and about to die of the heart disease gifted to me by my dads side of the family.

The job I have offers an EAP that I’ve debated calling but I truly just can’t deal with telling another person about my problems just to either listen to them pretend to give a shit or just literally watch there eyes glaze over as they wait for me to stop talking.

Do you think those who can't help themselves are simply left to die out on their own?,"Without family or friend's support. With no meaningful connections making others feel it's worthy to help you. You are just left with whatever happened to you to deal with it with exactly zero assistance. No one would come to save you even though you've failed multiple times on self-help. It's like Darwin's theory about natural selection. We are simply the small percentage of malfunctioning individuals that's meant to be put down and die out on our own. We're deemed and doomed to be left out. But modern society values human rights, well...at least on some degree, so you're told ""YOLO your life is precious and you're loved"". But in reality it's literally and seriously just false hope only to let you keep getting tortured for even longer. We humans boast ourselves thinking we're already beyond the barbarical cruel nature out in the wild but we're still just animals. So the rules of nature still applies to us. The weak and the malfunctioning are meant to get filtered out and die. That's how simple and cruel life is and had always been this way since the dawn of time. 

So yeah. I think that's just how it is. You'd especially get to feel this when you're utterly destroyed by the pain so you're in a bad shape. In that state absolutely no one would help you even when you pay them. That's simply how stuff works and I honestly understand it.

Hes a big boy he will have to get over it. I just am done. With everything. Lost the coolest house. Now all my stuff is in storage. I had a storage but had to get a new one cause my old one that held all my sentimental things well they are all moldy. Dead people's things anyways who cares. I shouldn't be sentimental I guess. The universe has spoken. So now what I have left is going into another storage cause I don't have a way to find a home. My truck will need to be towed somewhere because its broke down outside said home. I'm doing everything by myself and I work two jobs and had a shit ton to do before I fly out and i didnt get to do anything. Except my hair i tried to do that but i wrecked it now i look like shit. My phone fried the other day so I'm with out phone. I'm using wifi to communicate which let's face it know one talks to me. My boyfriend is a piece of ahit so i broke up with him but I'm disorganized attached and i cant help but beg for him back because I have no self worth. He finally blocked me cause he is tired of me even though all I'm doing is begging him to abuse me because that's all I know. See thing is I've been on this mental health journey healing 40 years of abuse and I was actually doing ok till I met him and then I lost everything and now him so I'm dysregulated and suicidal because let's face all reality... mental health is bs.

Will I ever get through this?,"I'm 22(M), and I'm in my final year in some university in Nigeria. Recently, I've been having some thoughts of ending my life. It's crazy, because this is the first time I'm saying this out loud lol. I guess I have never said it out loud because I wish it wasn't true, plus I think the reason why I'm having these thoughts is pretty much stupid in the grand scheme of things. It may sound dumb, but the reason I've been having these thoughts is because I may end up not graduating this year, and my energy for school is nonexistent. I never really liked school from day one. And I live in a society that bases your worth majorly on your academic achievements and then financial status. The moment I stepped into this university, I have been dreaming about leaving or dropping out. I study Engineering, and the programme typically spans 5 years, and I always thought that before the 5 years would be up, I'd hit jackpot in my career as a frontend developer and drop out.
I think the major reason why not graduating this year and having an extra year is such a big deal is because of the pressures I experience. Growing up, I had always been the intelligent one and people tend to have high expectations of me because they regard me as intelligent, and those expectations typically involves doing well in the university. But, I just... can't. I hate this school. I don't like being around these people. Every morning I wake up here, it always feels like I'm being strangled. I hate going to classes, I hate writing exams, I hate all of it. And I've never been open about this because I'm afraid of judgement.  Heck, even as I type this I'm judging myself. But feeling this way about school, and then having to stay an extra year?! It feels impossible. I don't think I can do it. And then opening up to my parents and siblings about my academic failures feels like a hurdle that I cannot possibly cross. Especially my parents. Their expectations of me are too high, and they care about me a lot, and I would hate to disappoint them. My parents are not the progressive sort at all. I know for a fact that they won't take it well. They definitely won't. And I'd hate to make them sad, but I can't avoid it at this point. Everything just feels overwhelming right now. Right now, it's hard to imagine myself living past the next few months. My mental health is on thin ice, and I can't really talk to anyone about this because I'm afraid of being judged by them. I just wished I didn't care or gave a fuck about any of it, but I do, and it's eating away at me everyday. Plus I have so much school work to do, but I haven't even been able to leave my room lol. I feel like a failure, and I feel like I have disappointed a lot of people who had any sort of expectations of me. It's difficult imagining a life past all of this, but I hope it happens. I love my family, and I wouldn't want to make them sad or disappointed because of me.",Temporary-College649,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4azyz/will_i_ever_get_through_this/

Been through various rounds of medications, therapies, hospitalizations, the whole thing. I don’t understand why I am the way that I am. Growing up I never struggled, at least financially. I feel guilty for my illness. My parents never deserved to have to put up with me. Now that I’m an adult, things are even worse despite my medication I’ve been on consistently for over 2 years. Everyday is the same. I’m deteriorating mentally but don’t have the heart to handle it. I turned to Reddit because I feel like a burden to the ones around me and to the ones who know me.

I’m So Tired,"I don’t think this is a unique take but like many people on this sub. Every night I go to sleep and best case scenario would be not waking up. I used to have some kind of joy in college but since graduating almost 10 years ago I hate my job, can’t get out of it, and the things I used to enjoy like streamers, movies, hanging with friends, etc. Just everything feels like everyone and everything is trying to push an agenda, or sell something. 

I used to be into sports but then I realized these are just people fighting for their lively hood, and me telling them they suck they will feel that same feeling I feel at work when I feel like I am disappointing people and will try and work harder for some reason (money, family whatever). Streamers and people on YouTube and tv are all just acting 90% of the time to get more views and clicks and subscribers so they get more sponsors from companies who want more money, constantly getting advertised to blah, blah, blah.

Family and friends are there but all have their own agendas. Mom is a Christian I’m not, friends want me around because I make things more fun (i.e. I can drink a lot and keep the vibes going).

I’m stuck and dying seems like the only way out,"Posted this in another sub too but it might be better suited to here:

Honestly I felt so stupid and dramatic writing all this but I’ll post it anyway because idc anymore. 

I’ve been depressed and feeling suicidal for about 3 months now but things have gotten majorly worse in the past couple weeks. I don’t know how I make it through every day, I’m so bored and there’s nothing I enjoy anymore. The only reason I’ve made it until now is my family and my dog. However my family are going on holiday without me in 2 days. This is like the 5th time they’ve done it because I have severe anxiety and I can’t go with them. This time though, I REALLY need them. I’ve tried expressing what I’m feeling and had the help of my mental health worker too but they’re going anyway. My MH worker thinks they should go too and I’ll cope better than I think I will. I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they’re the only thing keeping me going. And while they’re away my dog is going to the kennels because I can’t even look after her by myself. 

I’ve expressed these thoughts mostly to my MH worker who has relayed them to my family but my family don’t understand why I can’t tell them these things myself. I’ve told them it’s very difficult. I’ve expressed the fact I want to die to all of them (MH worker and family) and I felt like they under reacted. Maybe they think I’m being dramatic and I wouldn’t actually do anything, which was true up until now but now I’m in such an awful place I don’t trust myself not to try to hurt myself or kms. Tonight I self harmed for the first time. I didn’t do much and am too much of a wimp to be honest but I had an urge to do it. I feel like I’m a manipulative bitch because it feels like the urge came from me wanting them to see how bad things are. I still have the urge to do more but like I said, I’m a wimp. Anyway I feel like if I tell my parents, everything will blow up. They get so stressed out about me and I know they need a break but I can’t survive that right now. I honestly feel so stuck. Dying seems like the only way out. 

I’ve also had intrusive thoughts about hurting other people. Like I said, I don’t trust myself. I would never do anything like that in my right mind but clearly I’m not in my right mind right now and I’m worried I’ll go crazy and snap. I genuinely don’t know what to do. If I don’t let my family go I feel like they’ll resent me. But it’s not like there’s even any way I can make them not go. So therefore suicide seems like the only way out.

Unrelenting anger,"More towards management. More towards apathetic cowards. Fly that white flag, you gave up years ago. Pacifists are nothing but cowards with a mask justifying things they don't believe in, themselves. Get wrecked.

I'm sick of this punch down economy. Tired of being exhausted and pushed way past my limit. Injured. Sick. Yeah. I've had exactly way too much.

If I have to explain one more time, years ago, the reason I left my ex wasn't because the hitting or thrown things or smashing shit, but that I was close to hitting back. That anger. That fucking anger. That made me run. I hate that feeling. Afraid I'd become the idiot or monster others became.

are u telling me that sadness and loneliness will forever follow me? fuck that. being born into this family is a fucking curse and i hate myself. i hate my ex for leaving me and i hate my friends for treating me like shit. everything is boring and im barely living, just vaping and drinking painkillers to go through each painful fucking moment. theres no food in the house, no love from my parents, and going to college is a pain in the fucking ass, i dont fucking like anyone there. there's no point in living. all is shit.

Being pushed to the edge. ,"Nothing good ever happens to me, in fact, only bad things happen to me. Over the past 4 years I've been faced will so many horrible things and whenever I try to be positive or hopeful, life knocks me back down with something else. I feel like I'm constantly being punished and I don't even know what for. I'm being pushed to my edge. I have no path anymore in life and no hope for anything. I'm 26 and nothing has ever gone my way, not once. I am watching everyone I know constantly achieve all their hopes and dreams and it's painful. 

I've been suicidal in the past, and although in this exact moment I don't want to do it, I feel like I'm starting to have no choice. Realistically, it might be the best option for me. I am so exhausted that I don't even have strength to 'be positive' anymore.

I need help,"I’m a 18 yr old female. 
A lot of what I see on here i more normal I worry that what I’m about to say isn’t or that I will be judged. Please I just want help.

I have homicidal thoughts. I hate it. I hate most that I could do it and possibly get away with it. On a metric scale I’m attractive. So I know I could get them to follow me and do as I say till they realize what’sabout to happen. For background I was abused severely when put into the care of my aunt for a few years. I was sexually abused and was having hard drugs tested on me regularly by her boyfriend. After going back to my parents life was better until my dad passed. Watching him die in the street was the hardest thing I’ve had to endure. My homicidal thoughts began as nightmares I would see people bleeding out but never be able to make out any distinct features. It quickly escalated as I began hunting animals like deer. It went to intrusive thoughts about harming strangers, most of them had nothing in common except the fact that they where men. After meeting my friend we’ll call her Lilly it stopped momentarily. Until she committed. After that it was stronger than before. It became an itch burried in my skin I couldn’t reach, id try to scratch it till the skin was falling off it quickly became something that caused se me to almost twitch even in public. And the thoughts became more gruesome, I’d think of setting them loose in the woods and hunting them. I made a list of all the sex offenders in my city and watch them when I can. Staring at them and stalking. Hunting. There where moments if I staved myself enough that I didn’t feel the urge as much do to pure exhaustion. I’m introverted but do well socially so when I reconnected with my highschool friend who well call j it stopped for a moment just like with Lilly. I’m some ways he reminds me of her in his own way. The feeling of safety and comfort. After a while we confessed we had feeling for each other but due to his religion we didn’t and haven’t so much as kissed. And in someways I think that’s something I love about our situation. That it’s pure. Recently my thoughts have been coming back resulting in SH to try to stop them. I love him just like I did Lilly. I want these thoughts to stop. I want to have a normal life. Another factor that makes this so hard it that most days I can’t tell if I’m even alive. It feels like it not real. Like nothing is. So I struggle finding ways to change when I’m not sure what happening to me.

Forsaken Myself,"Heh, 21 years constantly fighting on a warpath. Achieving success after success, building myself up and investing in myself. Only for all of it to be stripped away. Once a genetically modified freak of nature, only to end up as mere flesh and bones. No medical objective reason. Alone with my thoughts, voluntarily. Albeit I can’t even hear them anymore. 

Every single day, helping countless people. Life deserves to be a place of serenity and tranquility for everyone.

Or so I thought.

I have reached to a point where: I no longer formulate thoughts in my head. Constant autopilot mode, pure instinct. These decades of reading, absorbing knowledge, working tirelessly for validation only to become a laughing stock. Focus? Concentration? Achieving tasks? Used to mean something to me, it’s not that I don’t have the energy to talk. It’s just I literally don’t come up with anything of use. Thoughts that used to take me milliseconds to form now take minutes. It’s painful watching this fall from grace yet live it as well. 

Emptiness, hollowness. Numb. 
These 3 words pretty much sum up my situation. 

I honestly still don’t know the reason I get out of bed. I’ve seen my family and friends reach out and try their utmost best to help me. Can’t pour out of an empty cup sadly. It takes me an insurmountable amount of effort to even utter words. 

I am too much of a coward to proceed with my life, or do anything really. So this raises the question, “Why Live?” I am also too much of a coward to take my own life.

Crossroads, I have now decided to fully confine myself in my room. Spend the rest of my days staring into the abyss, 0 activity. Just pondering the walls of my room. Only then will I feel true inner peace having obliterated my life rather than face public humiliation. I don’t get to hear it anymore. 

Ambition? Drive? Passion? Aspirations? Goals? Nah. I’ll pass. I tried and I have nothing left to give anymore. 

I am about to go to a therapist (forced by my father) tomorrow. I grew up in a community where mental health is severely stigmatized due to heavy religious influence so I wonder what her reactions going to be when I showcase this adamant desire. Truly is pathetic. 




For the first time in my life, I’ve went from a social bubbly person to embracing 4 months of self-inflicted self-sabotage. All sense of self-identity, self-worth, self esteem has virtually dissipated. Can’t even follow along plots of shows anymore. Don’t remember anything. Purely living in the moment. The bliss of being alone! 

Should I document this journey Im about to embark? I’m 100% serious that I will genuinely live the rest of my days locked in my room with no socialization or any form of contact. Atleast that way people can examine and I can atleast have my legacy be that as an experiment. I’m willing to purchase a camera and send the footage to anyone who wants it, sort of like a vlog lmao.

"I gave so much to someone for years through love and friendship only for them to still treat me like shit, I often feel like I just can't take it anymore. I am so tired. [**warning** LONG Vent Post, possibly missing details] (?)","I'm in my early 20s soon to begin the mid age, ever since I was 13 or 12'ish I knew this person who I cared about, I won't get deep into it but we have so much history together and we were super close and know a lot about each other, but I'll be honest, fuck this guy, entering adulthood I've tried be a supportive girlfriend when we dated, a supportive bestfriend when we broke off the relationship and came to terms with it, managing to still be good friends through in and through out. But fuck when it got tense it got tense, I don't feel right giving people space when they're upset (unless they state it themselves or hint it as best as they can without putting it into words) so I'd be the one to try and cheer him up as much as I could even if it really did seem like it never did much at all (though he'd tell me otherwise and say it would.) 

We hung out every day or almost every day for years, so it could get draining when either of us spiraled into a bad mood for whatever reason, yeah he'd try here and there but I'd say when it came to helping the other feel better I was good or at least, effortful when it came to it, I loved him so much just as the person he was regardless of his flaws and I looked passed his cold demeanor he'd put on sometimes. I am pretty much crying because I just dished out so much for this fucking guy who in the last moments of what I really do assume was our friendship, he couldn't look past me just being a fucking human and being overwhelmed with something we were working on together, I may have sucked at the communication bit but he got so fucking angry at me simply for just being overwhelmed? I tried man. 

Where he was lonely I tried introducing him to friends, where he was upset financially I'd offer him what advice I could offer that seemed realistic at best for what little experience I have with it. I admit at some point there was a falloff with how clingy I was with him and I admit to obviously being immature when we were younger but I have matured since then, so much so I'd say that maybe I am more mature than him, I recognize and don't blame people anymore for feeling emotions- the way he definitely-fucking-does, and maybe- this is just assuming on his side; he just didn't like seeing me become and grow into my own person- in the sense that I wasn't basically dependent on him for learning things and being the only friend I had because I eventually made new friends years later (I'd say, when I turned 22 I started opening up more etc) after being a loner aside from him being my only friend for practically my whole life and me living through abusive family trauma, plus a side dish of even more trauma outside of family for days on end; lasting for years which he definitely knows my life history because he was and I say without exaggerating- my other half, he knows more about me than my own mother probably does (that's how close we were.)

Anyways, some stuff went down between me and him last year that left a scar on our friendship, where he decided to disconnect from me and our mutual bestfriend at the time, the bridges he tried burning left me to drop being friends with that other friend shared between us. I missed him every day for months, but I tried looking past it to finish school because I wasn't gonna let people who left me hurting so much stop me from graduating; and just around the time I finished school, he had tried talking to me a few things for lesser important things, eventually I had managed to reconnect us as friends, and him opening up and reconnect with his other friends because he tried doing a self isolating thing, which I immediately recognized as destructive and unnecessary but still forgave him for it because I was not a stranger to doing self destructive things myself. 

Any who- yeah, I looked past it even though it was an awful time for me, we were friends as usual again etc. I thought everything was alright and maybe after that went down- I thought we learned to be more understanding basically of each other, but nope. Rewind to around May, me and him get the idea to work on something together, blah blah blah, I eventually start feeling extremely overwhelmed easily but I am afraid to let him know that, so instead of telling him how I feel I try and rub it off instead of talking to him (because, I have a history of being a people pleaser- I don't want to upset him) he eventually asks to talk to me about the thing we were working on, I tell him how I was feeling, he lets me know basically that he was frustrated with me, the conversation on his half feels colder, I thought we were just talking things out but nope, he lets me genuinely know that he really just frustrated with me when I thought he'd be understanding and not lash out at me for being overwhelmed as I have stated to him- multiple times, so I'm like- ""Ok, I will give you space, sorry."" at that point forward we are half ways done through May into June, he hasn't said a damn word to me while making it very obvious he is just doing literally anything else, I know his schedule too so like- ??? There would've been no fucking reason for him to cold shoulder me and give me the silent treatment since our argument in the middle of the month, I give it some deep thought like- ""Yeah- wow, I really fucked up he really just isn't talking to me at all."" 

I vent to my other friends that he just isn't talking to me so while I confide in my other friends for guidance and support; I actually let my other friends know if this guy doesn't talk to me into the next month of June, I'm just cutting him off because what's the point? I feel scolded for having emotions in a fun project that wasn't even taking off yet and was really just in discussion phase. There was nothing being lost yet- at least to me; though in our argument he pointed his finger at me and said some shit like ""You have an income; I don't"" so I guess I was actually obligated to work on it with him or something, even though I tried being there for this guy while he tried looking for a job and shit though that never went anywhere. Lol... alright man. Anyways, it's pretty much June now, I just let him know what's what, I leave him with the details of our project because he just seemed more passionate about it than I was at this point and I just cut him off because this guy was just so fucking unforgiving, I think to myself that that's it- and a side of relief but also a hint of shame, that shame grew because I didn't feel right carving him out of my life but I really didn't know what else to do when the guy who I cared so much about didn't talk to me for the rest of the month of May.  Skip to a few days ago where I reached out to just talk to each other, see if maybe we can just hear each other's side. At this point I don't expect anything anymore, other than to just hear it out and MAYBE be understanding, but I don't even think that happened. I feel like all these years were genuinely wasted because in my newer closer friendships, I just can't give as much enthusiasm and care that I gave to this one person who I considered my other half. All the hours and attention and care and support I definitely fucking gave feels like it was going into a garbage chute with nothing to gain but shitty compost- in other words. I feel like this guy just left me with nothing but hot steamy shit on my chest. It is my friends birthday today (the one I met around Christmas), (not the guy who I've been venting about) but I feel like I just couldn't provide enough celebration and positive attention to him because I feel just a dark cloud of depression looming over me right now. I feel like shit man, I can't win no matter where I think I'm getting better I'm really not, I want to cry so fucking much, so many years of expending so much energy on this guy. I don't know if me and him will ever pick back up to the spot we were in before the project when we were good friends with each other. I'm too much of a people pleaser to be thinking about someone who cold shouldered me for half the month of May and never was understanding about what \*\*I\*\* was dealing with or HAVE dealt with when I gave him basically all I could ever offer another person. Insane, I'm so fucking tired. I want to off myself most days, I feel like a decayed corpse with nothing left to offer to anyone because I am sucked fucking dry. Just a lifeless doll with nothing but thoughts of my traumatic past I feel like I will never heal from and I am sorry to anyone who is friends with someone like me.

"I wanna do it, but im 15, is that too young?","I am no ones first person. Everyone has someone, like a pair, and I don't. My gran's (who I live with) first person is my extremely unstable mother, who I am turning out exactly alike. My aunt has my cousin. My mother has my step father. My father has my half sister. All my ""friends"" (Who call me a disapointment and just ignore me and hate me ig) all have the person who they'd pair with iykwim. Like in our friend group, (fake names) Anna has Fred, Naomi has Garcia, ect. People who they'd call their best friends or someone they can talk to at any time for no reason. And I have absolutely fucking no one. Also, why the fuck is my mother the one who's ""sensitive"" and ""has mental health issues"" (She's an abusive narsicisst), when I'm the one who's planned to kill herself over 4 times. I'm the one suffering because of her. But to everyone else, she's just ""sick"" and ""needs to be given time"". She abused me my entire life and is still getting in little snide comments every time I see her, but I'm the one who's ""horrible"" and will ""spend the rest of my life alone"", and ""No wonder no one likes me"". I hate this fucking world and my life so much. I practically just turned 15 a month ago, and watch me not have another birthday again.  And now my mother wants to come to Australia with us next year even though she's already went. And it's not just for a holiday, it's for me: my exams, getting into collage, graduating, and my birthday. And nobody seems to understand me and they all just yell and hit and throw stuff. I have no friends. No support. No therapy. Nothing. And Because of this fucking stupid thing, I can't do shit. My family go out for food all the time for birthday's and special events, but I can't. Because I physically cannot force myself to go and eat with 20+ people (my family is giant). I hate it. I want to be normal. I want to be able to talk to people. I want to go to parties. I want to stay out late and hang around with people. I want to do things. I hate autism. Anybody who says ""autism is a superpower"" and ""Autism is an amazing thing"" is fucking lying. I would give anything to be normal. If someone ends up making a ""cure"" I'll be first in line. I want to kms. I want to. I really do. I need to.

I made multiple cuts to my neck over the course of a like 5 hours the night before I had to go to work. Even did pushups during and starting drinking liquor to help blood flow but I have this stupid feeling of self preservation I stopped once the blood flow from my neck really started. Was able to get someone’s attention outside my building then was rushed to hospital given stitches and put in inpatient rehab for a month where I learned some great techniques that were very effective in the controlled environment. Once I left the facility I moved back with my family and got a job and just sort of moved on. I was hopeful, but overtime the looks people give me is starting to get to me. I feel like they all know where the scar comes from. I know they don’t, but I also don’t know.

I wish this wasn't the case, but I don't have any money to buy my own house. I'm also obese at 5'8"" 280 pounds. At times I try to do exercise, but I find it extremely difficult and don't last long. Also, I tell myself that I'm going to start lifting weights, but I have zero motivation and have a hard time concentrating. I always feel like hot garbage, zero energy, sloppy. I've had some ancestors that had cancer, could it be a hereditary disease or something? I've lived a very sedentary life for 11 years.

I feel helpless, I can't sleep at night. I live in a house where they have a car repair shop. I'm willing to work there but constantly find myself distracted and don't do anything.

I wish I had a job that paid me the minimum wage at least, but I live in a somewhat rural area, lots of houses but not many commercial buildings. Everything is 30 minutes away and I don't have a car. I could use some money right now.

What can I do to improve my life? Are there any supplements out there that help with well-being? Maybe I have some type of deficiency that makes me feel like I'm depressed. Perhaps a chemical unbalance in the brain? When I try to sleep at night, I feel like someone is performing an exorcism on me and feel awful.

I know there are supplements out there that could help me, but I have no idea which. I ingest anti-depressants like Ativan, Restoril and Zyprexa. The only thing they do is aid with sleep somewhat.

There are lots of things I want, like a gaming computer and perhaps find a girlfriend, but women like men who are in shape and take care of themselves. I have a hard time brushing my teeth.

I'm convinced there's something wrong with me, but I don't know what it is. My school experience was terrible, I was bullied from middle school, then my parents got divorced right before I entered high school and moved 2 hours away. The last few years of school didn't get much better.

I want to live, be happy and feel good. I'd love to travel a little perhaps, although I'm not a huge fan of traveling, but most importantly, I want to achieve independence.

My dream is to play iRacing. I've always been big on video games, and always aspired to have iRacing since it was released, almost two decades ago. I find it hard to believe that I haven't yet played that game. I'm super scared to talk to people with fears that they're going to make fun of me.

What is wrong with me? I always tell myself, if others can do something, I can do it too.

When I was in high school, I fantasized about being a trans, started doing stupid things with my food, like overeating white rice so my glutes would get bigger. I also made my testicles drop so I could produce more estrogens to look like a woman. Could it be hormonal imbalance? My fapping doesn't feel good at all like it did in high school. I have man boobs as well and my orgasms are super weak. I think I have erectile dysfunction. I am uncircumcised. 

I almost had intercourse with a man in his 60's when I was in high school. Entered his house at least 10 times with intentions of doing it, but never actually did anything. Perhaps that scene gave me some mental trauma? He did touch me a few times, but I was scared and just left the house. I also gave my stepbrother head once when I was 15. Maybe I have a disease or something.

My father was pretty abusive when I was younger, I've always been told to respect older peers, he would sometimes hit me with belts when I did something bad in school. It was super scary; I was always scared of him.

I don't want to get in trouble, I just want to get to the bottom of my issue, assuming there is one. I just want to be happy. I really need to get in shape first if I want to find a woman willing to be with me.

I smoked weed in high school and had a panic attack. My memory of that situation is not very good. I'm not sure if I did something to trigger the panic attack. I may have started doing circles, which made me dizzy, but I'm not sure.

Any supplements or pills out there that could help my well-being? Multivitamins are not doing the trick.

I also experienced jock itch, which I thought was candida albicans. This jock itch thing lasted for more than a decade from 2011 to 2022. It has been gone for almost two years now, but I still may have something down there.

Spanish is my first language. I have family members in California that have decent income, but they don't want me there or even help me at all. My father lives there and I wish I could move with him but it's not his house.

I share all of these things with you to see if we can get to the bottom of my issues. Maybe it's medical or something insignificant or easy to fix, I don't know.",ItsJJ_PR,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3iddj/i_think_im_depressed_maybe_im_just_lazy/

No one to talk to,"I'm 29 years old and have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. The past year has been the worst it's ever been, living on autopilot, getting no joy out of almost everything, thoughts of dying daily. The one thing that would always keep me going was my wonderful girlfriend. Without her I'm not sure I'd be here today. Just being with her was enough to keep me going, she was the one thing that never failed to make me happy. I never shared any of this with her. I was so afraid of losing her if she saw how truly broken I am. The past year has been so rough, I know I haven't been the partner she deserves. I've felt so numb, stagnant, so tired and despite my efforts to hide these things they've bled through into my life. Making me into someone I wish I wasn't. She deserves so much more than that. She left me two days ago and I am completely broken. I was barely holding on before but now I don't know if I can. I let my depression take away the one good thing in my life. I'm so afraid to die, I don't think there's anything after this. I don't want it to hurt. I'm too scared to do it but I don't want to be alive.

Who am I?,"Hi, good morning/afternoon/evening. I'm writing this post to ask for your opinion on my behaviour.

For some months I've been taking SSRIs (Serotonin Recapture Inhibitors) which help me control my mind and depressive thoughts. The ones I take work really well. Although I need to give it a psychological push to keep working sometimes, but that's expected.

Now, I had to stop taking it because of ""reasons"", and my brain has slowly become depressed again, and although I feel sad and depressed more easily, I also feel more... Free, I feel like I am the real me, I feel like I'm really feeling, I'm really in touch with my own feelings and don't feel the need force myself to feel (or even be) a certain way.

With this, the dilemma arises - To be, or to not be depressed? 

While with SSRIs I am more physically free (my body doesn't get anxious as easily, or depressed which leaves me tired and not wanting to do anything, or worse...) and more productive with my life, I also feel like I'm suffocating myself emotionally, because, even though SSRIs do let me feel sad and sometimes even ""depressed"", I still feel like I'm not being the real me, and instead feeling and doing what is expected of me.

Thinking about this scares me a little. Even though, the answer should be obvious, I also think about what's going to happen later in life if I do keep taking these.

Did I have depression as a child?,"When I was little, around 7 or 8 years old, I used to get this... sensation. I'd be lying in bed in the dark and I would get almost a mental image of a ball of dots in my chest. But I'd be frozen in place, my mind would be in chaos. I'd hear my parents or the TV outside, life going on as normal around me, and the ball would start expanding. I felt like it was trying to burst out of me. And I had to ""eat"" it to keep it under control; I had to keep taking huge gulps of air because that's what would make the ball smaller. And I never got it to disappear; I think I just fell asleep from exhaustion. I don't remember thinking anything, just trying to make the ball stop growing.

I've been grappling with my sanity for a few hours now, and I feel mentally the experience is the same as when I was a child. The same feeling of chaos, the attempts at control but now it's trying to think happy thoughts, watching videos to distract myself, belittling myself so I get a grip. The same notion that if I don't have it under control, something really bad will happen. To think about it, it ends the same way as well; eventually giving in to exhaustion with my mind still fried.

It's almost like having a fever, I feel so consumed by this 'pain' in my head. I know even when I'm spiraling and weeping tears and going on a rant about how disgusting I am, how I want to die, how messed up everything is, I know I'm ""going through it"".

As a child, I knew there was something wrong with me. Now, I identify it as depression and feelings of anxiety, misery, anger, foreboding, confusion, guilt, shame, disgust, like a whole mess of things. Mental health wasn't a thing in the country I live in, so my parents just assumed I had a stick up my ass and wanted to be difficult. To be fair to them, I used to do this thing where I'd swallow my food without chewing... I really wanted to die even back then.

Need to figure out whats going on ,"Hi everyone,

I am a 16-year-old female, and I’ve noticed some significant issues with myself. Unfortunately, I can't get a proper diagnosis because my parents are against it. Here are the problems I've been facing:

1. Academic Performance: I used to excel in academics until the 10th grade, scoring 95% in my exams. However, this was below my expectations, leading to burnout. Since then, I've subconsciously put in less effort, resulting in a significant drop in my grades in the 11th grade. Even when I try, it doesn't seem to be enough. I now experience extreme exam anxiety, which causes me to freeze and lose focus during exams, despite knowing the material.

2. Action Paralysis: I often find myself unable to start tasks, even when I want to and know I need to. Deadlines pass, and I’m unable to take action, which has severely impacted my productivity.

3. Attention Issues: My ability to pay attention has deteriorated significantly. I struggle to focus on anything for long periods, and this has been an issue for a while but has worsened recently.

4. Emotional Numbness: For the past year, I’ve felt emotionally numb and detached from everything in life. I don’t feel happiness, sadness, or any strong emotions, positive or negative. I also struggle to care about anything, which makes me feel worse, but I don’t even care about feeling worse.

5. Anxiety and Disorganization: My anxiety attacks have intensified. I frequently lose items, am very messy, and often disconnect from conversations, going blank for a while. I’ve lost interest in activities I once enjoyed, like working out. My daily routine, which used to drive me, now lacks structure and consistency.

6. Chronic Fatigue: I am always tired, regardless of how much rest I get.

Despite multiple attempts to improve my situation and get my grades back up, I keep failing to stick to my commitments and feel all over the place.

Can anyone offer advice or help on how to manage these issues?

Depression rotting my brain,"For background, I've been depressed for nearly 10-12 years now. I'm writing this because I came across a study with how depression can affect the brain. I don't believe I'm a lost cause although it constantly feels that way because of my habits, lack of motivation and brain.

It feels like a everyday battle with myself and my feelings. I don't feel sad rather disappointed and conflicted of my life- when that fails I feel empty. I am creative, I have always been creative so I constantly come with ideas but I get burnt out so easily. One day I feel so energetic before I fall back into the cycle of sleeping for days, not bothering to do anything. I feel like wasted potential because I know I can do better and I have in later years. Sometimes when I do feel motivated, my mind goes blank and I struggle to remember or physically do anything.

In the study, it showed how depression can cause memory loss, struggles with social abilities and also academic knowledge aswell. I don't believe my depression is at its peak but it's definitely gotten worse mentally, the only difference I can tell is in late years- I was more social and had a strict schedule to follow due to school, events and friends which forced me to get out. In recent years, I don't go out at all or speak to anyone. Normally, I rot away on social media or I'm social in my online presence by playing video games. I don't study anything, after HS I didn't know what do to in college (it's only been a few years after hitting 18). Studying and good grades were pressured on me negatively, causing me to lose any interest in school.

I can tell there's something wrong with my head, my mind feels so blurry like I can't focus. I can't find motivation to do anything, I feel very numb and lost. I can barely spell anymore without auto correct on my phone, same with keeping up with clean handwriting. My memory is like a Goldfish, sometimes I can remember the day before or even what I've done the current day when speaking to my partner. I can feel that I've gotten almost stupider and that my brain is just literally loosing braincells. It's a repeating cycle that i wish to stop, i was so smart before- i could spell most words, i would dedicate myself to art n ideas, i would even get out more. I know and need to make a change so I can get better for my future. At the moment, therapy isn't a option for me and same with medicine but here's what I've added to my daily life.

1. Green tea, it's simple but it's the very start of my routine. It's a ""beginning"" but also has benefits
2. Healthy meals, I stopped buying processed food and instant. I buy minimum items but I try to stick to fresh things like fruit, veggies and nuts. Although i still have trouble finding motivation to get up and cook.
3. Sleeping early, this is hard considering I have Insomnia but I find myself the most productive when I accept that I can't stay up all night- there will always be another day for me to do more.
4. Lists, lists seem to help me alot. I normally list items I need to buy for self-care and budget
5. Walking, as of now- I don't walk due to it feeling like hell outside but it was refreshing to do. Exercise is helpful
6. Showering, finding motivation to shower can be hard when you're laying in bed but I use this as a point to try to start my day and feel more awake.

I'm unsure if these things will 100% help me considering depression has affected me for years now but it's a start, this isn't advice for anyone but if you feel like it can be beneficial to you then go for it. After reading the study, i heard practicing things such as quick math, writing and grammar helped people. I also wish to extend my attention span by watching long TV shows or doing tasks for a few hours.

How do I open up to someone about my thoughts? I want to get help.,"Years ago I first started developing depression and anxiety symptoms due to bullying and stress in school, mainly due to being neurodivergent. It made my life a living hell because I had no friends and my own family would call me r3tarded or say I was “acting dramatic” if I tried to open up. If I showed any deeper symptoms, they’d tell me I’d get locked up in “The Loony Bin” where I’d be strapped down to a bed and pumped full of pills like a slave. Hearing that was already terrifying enough, but to hear very real and very similar incidents happen to people I knew didn’t make it any better.

None of them know this, but I almost went through with overdosing one night in the 7th grade due to a humiliating incident that turned out to be my breaking point. For whatever reason, I just couldn’t go through with it. Maybe it was my dog or my few online mutuals on PopJam, but instead, I just cried myself to sleep and foolishly hoped that I wouldn’t wake up the next morning. I had a similar incident due to an ex, but that was less severe I think. 

My family would always tell me that “depression was temporary and it’ll go away on its own” but it never did for me.

Years later those thoughts just became passive. I didn’t want to kill myself, but at the same time I didn’t care what happened to me anymore. I didn’t care if I got kidnapped, or got run over, or anything like that. As long as it was quick I wouldn’t mind. There were times I would walk on bridges and have intrusive thoughts about jumping off. 

Even when going through diagnosis stuff and even when some people asked, I could never tell the full truth that I had suicidal thoughts. The idea of being abused, assaulted and cut off from the rest of the world in a closed facility was a concept worse than death to me. Even prisoners had more rights than that. It was essentially a punishment for not getting the job done yourself, run by people that only saw broken individuals as trash to be repurposed instead of fixed.

But I’m tired of living in mental exhaustion everyday, waiting for something else to kill me. I’m tired of not knowing what I want to do with myself one day and feeling like I’m just a useless background character in everyone else’s life. I actually have a few people I care about and want to stay for. But I don’t want to keep living like this anymore and I don’t know how to change the way I feel. I’ve tried getting out more and getting into hobbies but they’re never permanent solutions to the pain. I want to tell someone so maybe they’ll finally understand why I am the way I am. But I don’t want to risk being tortured if I say the wrong thing or too much. If anyone has any advice, I’d appreciate it.

17m ,"I have an older brother about 12 years older than me and up till I was 15 would constantly hit me if i were to do anything that upset or annoyed him. I would be 5 and anything i did to upset would result in me getting hit on the ground and punched all over. He would sometimes hit my older sister whos 4 years older but never like me since im a boy. I remember being small and tiny and crying after, it really hurt. I think he learned it from my dad since he would hit me and my sister too, but again it was much harsher on me and when my sister and I would go to visit and would tell our mom and she would get on his ass about how excessive he was. I remember when he hit my 4 year old half sister for walking in the parking lot when we were supposed to get in the car, she was just a baby. His mom is also like that, she would favor my sister and buy her food and clothes and id just have to tag along since she couldn’t leave me home, she always wanted a daughter but never had one. One time she hit cause i jumped over the couch cause I didnt want to get infront of the tv to intercut her show and she got a belt and whooped me for 2 minutes, my sister came to me after when i was crying and called my mom to pick us up. I dont go to visit often since then and have never stayed for more than a week since. Most of the time my brother would hit me i wouldnt tell my mom since nth would happen and he would just b mad. It didnt stop until i had the intention to kill him and tried stabbing him which he beat me down and told my mom and he stopped after.

 I tried talking to my mom about it but she just says its normal brother stuff and how her younger brother would fight with her, its not the same at all. They dont know whats it like to be that little and skinny and the way it hurts and crying cause all you wanted was to have fun but they wanted to punish me. She said im just supposed to move past it but those people arent my family, ive never felt loved by them only tolerated. I dont like them at all and they just think im a pussy. I dont think im overreacting, this isnt normal right. All my mom has to say is she tried her best as a single mother and thats it and she’s sorry i feel this way. It wasnt just the hitting, the verbal abuse of being reminded how ugly i was made really insecure about myself, i didnt do well in school and would get called things but it would always be “jokes”. Kids would laugh and say things about my skin, then id have to go home and hear the same thing. Im moreno and my family would just say things just reinforcing how lesser than human I really am. The german word is untermensch, thats what i am in their subconscious, thats what i appear as to everyone 

I think about killing myself alot and cry sometimes and my mom came in my room asking what was wrong in december, i told her to leave me alone and she wouldn’t get out so I pushed her out, not hard just pushed i made sure not to press her hard. My brother came in the room saying if i ever put my hands on her again he’d fuck me up. He still thinks about doing it, it made me want to end my life more and the only reason i havent done it is cause i dont have a gun, i dont know what to do. I have a 3.95 gpa since i try to do my work right at school since their isnt anything else to do. I dont think i like these people, i dont think whatever they do for me I can just move past it. I dont like these people and i have to vent on reddit since im not close to anyone and dont talk to anyone daily, its just me and my now ps5 thanks to my stepdad. I dont think i mind it but i feel alone, i feel like no matter what i do it doesnt matter.

I hate that I was born in America. Tried all year to immigrate out and failed. I want to set myself on fire.,"I’m sitting in my car now just crying and punching myself in the face. The society here is so cruel and unforgiving. Everyone is so dishonest they will just lie right to my face. The elites and rich who have hoarded 80% of the wealth for themselves hate the middle class and hate the poor! I have two degrees in business and experience with vocational work in the aviation industry and STILL I am not able to get a job that I can live off, so I’m stuck in my parents house despite having a full time office job. It’s so embarrassing. I hate our politicians! I’m so sick and tired of them. Especially trump! And now looks like he is going to stick his nose back into our lives because of all the sympathy he’s getting from his assassination attempt. It’s over, it’s inevitable there’s gonna be four more years of that racist moron. I’m just so done with my life here, it’s like a giant open air prison! There’s no escape. I just popped out of the womb in the wrong place and wrong time too. I just now went to the gas station and tried to take a shower in gasoline but of course I forgot, the pump won’t allow you to pump into open air, so nothing came out when I pointed the nozzle at my face so I just left before cops got called. So I’m just pondering what I should do. I really feel like dying. I’ve faced nothing but rejection and ostracization here. I give up on life. There is no escape from this country or even this life. Everything is toxic and stressful. I can’t take anymore.

Depressed animal lover ,"Hi, Im autistic , suffer from depression and severe anxiety and trauma from both of my parents, I'm 30 now but when I was younger then woman who gave birth to me physically abused me, and the old man who made me mentally abused me and I've attempted suicide 12 times .

I'm also very sensitive to animals, I don't like people mostly because of animal abuse, my trauma, paranoia, I love animals , every animal, but when they get hurt , I get extremely mad, I cry an I self harm, and I get suicidal, I HATE animal abuse, I've seen therapists ect and nothing helps.

But the fact animal abuse goes on, and it's basically legal, and there's nothing much I can do about it, cause I know it's not going to change because MOST people are cruel, greedy and selfish.

I have no connection towards people , no emotion at all but I like seeing horrible people in pain and suffering . KARMA.

I don't really know how to stop feeling that way and how to stop sabotaging any good feelings.

About killing myself.,"Hi, it's 03:32 AM when I'm writing this. I guess I just will write what's on my mind and maybe feel better after that. So, I'm 16, I have an amazing boyfriend and I love him so fucking much... I can't even describe how much I love that boy.

I had my first suicidal thought when I was 14. Bad things happened involving someone I really cared about. I remember I was crying so much, and then I thought about fucking killing myself for the first time. After that, more shit started to happen, with that I begun with the selfharm and after that, smoking, just to try to feel less pain. The fact is: in the last 2 years, a LOT of shit have been happening to me all the time and you know what? It's not like I'm not blamed for some of them. Last year, I had my first suicide attempt after a breakup. My parents were there to give me all the support I needed and that makes me feel like the worst person in the world. They don't deserve it. They deserve better, they deserve a child who don't fucking give problems. Does that makes sense? I don't have idea. I started dating my boyfriend in June 3 and things got better since then, but sometimes I feel like I'm not enough, and with sometimes I mean every fucking day. I want him to be happy and I'm fucking sure he won't be happy having to deal with trash like me. I'm so lucky to have him by my side but I hate myself so much that I catch myself thinking that I don't deserve to be happy and in fact I don't deserve any happiness. I'm a hopeless teenager whose only future certainly is death. I should just kill myself already and then my boyfriend would find someone better. Someone who don't selfharm every fucking day, someone who don't need to smoke to feel alive, someone better. Someone who won't give problems and will give him happiness. If by some reason you still reading this shit, I'm sorry for wasting your time, friend. Live a happy life and don't be a useless fucking trash as I did. 
I just need a final trigger to do it. I got ways to do it, I know how to do it, but I'm a fucking coward who have fear of pain. I want to die but I don't want to feel pain. Makes sense? Probably not. Since I can't talk about those things with the people around me, I guess this is the right place to say stuff like that. Just needed to put it out. Again, sorry for wasting your time.",Yukiwn,19,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3o6ia/about_killing_myself/
I'm tired.,"Everyday, I wake up only to realise how much I don't want to live. I have had attempts at suicide but was never able to go through all the way because I have a debilitating fear of death. I tried to slit my wrists but chickened out at the last minute and was only left with a shallow scratch that has long since faded. I couldn't even kill myself correctly. Fucking dogshit. I genuinely hate myself more than anyone in the world and think the world would be better off without me. If only I could just stop existing, oh what I would give to do that. I don't know if I have depression, most probably I do. Never got diagnosed. Probably never will. The social stigma is too much work to deal with. I also don't want to trouble my parents. Speaking of which, I wouldn't say I have had a bad childhood, it was pretty good, I just don't know why I turned out the way I did, a fucking mistake, a freak, someone better left dead. Is this irrational? Most probably. Doesn't matter. No matter how many times someone else says that I'm a good person or that I deserve more, I can't understand it, I can't internalize it, no, I refuse to do so. They don't understand myself as well as I do, it's just pity. Heh. Pity. I hate being pitied. Unfathomable and unreasonable hate. At this point I can't remember what it felt like to be happy, I can't really say I have been ""happy"", only had moments of transient euphoria with the thought of crushing self loathing at the back of my head at all times. Forget happiness, I can't even remember what happened these past few years, I'm always in a daze. Only thing I do is distract myself from the thoughts by consuming. Consuming anything. Content. Food. Anything. I wouldn't say I'm sad, most of the time I feel nothing. Utter apathy. Devoid of a soul. However, there are times I breakdown. I shouldn't have been born. How I wish someone else, anyone else was born in my place, in place of the scum that I am. My parents deserve a better son. My teachers deserve a better student. My sibling deserves a better brother. The world deserves a better person. I am utter trash. Worthless. Less than worthless, I make things worse. I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry. I don't even know what I am sorry for. That's a lie. I know what I am sorry for. I'm sorry for being a burden. I'm sorry for not being able to kill myself. I'm sorry for existing. I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I feel sad, I feel inconsolable grief, I shouldn't feel that, it's good that such a bad person like me suffers, but, it hurts. I'm sorry but it hurts. It hurts. It hurts. It hurts so much. I don't know if I want to be fixed or I even deserve to. I'm tired of living, tired of existing. I hope one day I close my eyes and never wake up and hope that that day will come soon. I won't kill myself, probably, too much of a pussy to do so. But, it hurts.

Im sick of being used,"It’s like a repeating pattern in my life. It’s so predictable I can write a step-by-step guide.

Someone befriends me, I get attached, then they ask for (what seems to me at the time like) a small favour. I do the favour, the person likes the results, so they ask for another favour a little bit bigger than the last one. I do it, they like the results again, then they ask again because they know I’m not going to say no. They know I’ll do it because “they’re my friend, of course I’ll help them”.

This happens over and over until I finally realize what’s going on. When the time comes, I express my concerns to them nicely. They act like it’s no big deal, like they understand and will change. I believe they will change, because they’re my friend. So I become blind to them continuing with the same old behaviour until I realize and talk to them again. Repeat this step a few times.

When it gets to the point where I’ve finally had enough, I express my concerns to them again, this time leaving no room for alternative interpretation. Then they gaslight me, act like they’ve been reasonable and I’m the crazy one, then actively go out of their way to avoid me for a bit.

If they know even the slightest thing about my mental health, they also act like it’s because of that too.

Is it really crazy or make me mentally unwell to not want to be treated like a soccer ball? Because that’s what I feel like. I feel like I’ve been kicked and passed around by all these people for various reasons, them all knowing what I’m like and that I don’t know how to say no.

And then when I do say no it’s like all hell breaks loose and I’m suddenly worth nothing to them anymore.

"I'm trying to find a reason to live, and i'm not finding it","Let's start saying i (M15) don't want to kill myself, neither self harm (unless you count aggressively biting my nails :P).
I feel like i move by pure inertia. I waited a lot of time dreaming of having friends and hanging out with them, but now that i have really good friends, i feel too tired to hang out with them most of the times.
My life is pretty simple. I wake up, i go to school (not for now lol), i come home, i play videogames, i have dinner, i play videogames, i go to sleep. Every day. I've tried lots of sports and hobbies, but still i didn't find a passion, and I'm starting to lose hope in finding it.
And the fact is... That i both like and hate my life. I know i'm wasting my life saying at home doing nothing, but i never have the energies to get out of this trashy routine. if i start something, it's because it happens, in a way or another. 

I just broke up with my gf because she was basically flirting with her friends and she gave me very little attention compared to how much i cared about her, and now i'm sure i can't be loved anymore. No one will ever love me as i do. And everytime someone comforts me saying ""you'll find someone"", i thank them but deep down i know it's a lie said to make me happy.

Please help me,"

Almost a month ago I lost my childhood 13 years old dog, and after that everything came back to me &lt;- this is a very important thing to see the world fromy my side

At The beginning of 2020 I was super stresfull abot the virus, it took me like 2 or 3 month to function like a normal person.

After that, the UA vs RU happened and I think it's destroyed my mind completely. I wasn't able to think about anything else busides the war that is happening near my country border.
About 1 to 1.5 year later I was able to function normally like with the virus, but the war thing was a way worse. 
I was wiking up in the middle of the night hearing the freaking tanks or air raid siren (it was in my head only), I had to took some sleeping pills to be able to sleep over 6 hours.

And now, after my dog died - everything came back to me. Now I'm even afraid of freaking thunders (I was never afraid of them).

I'm paranoid almost about everything.
I was talking with psychologist 2 or 3 days after my dog died, she just told me that I'm a strong person and I just need some time.

Almost a month ago, everything is still very hard for me, sometimes even harder than after the sad news.

I don't really know what I should do, I have ultra mixed feelings - but I don't feel the happiness as I use to felt it before everything.

"I have nothing to live for,  abuse TW","I’m 27 and still live at home with my mum and dad. My abusive mum has Huntington’s disease and I’m 50% at risk of developing it, I have decided not to get tested. My dad is my best friend and I wouldn’t still be here without him. 

I have several physical health issues along with mh issues like bpd, depression, anxiety and ocd. Because of this I’m not able to work full time but I do work part time in a job that I mostly enjoy but can be very stressful at times. 

I was abused on one occasion as a child which my mum witnessed and did nothing to stop. After this we did not have a good relationship and shortly after that is when her HD symptoms started to develop. Because of what happened I have never been in a relationship, I’ve never had sex, the most I’ve done is kiss someone. I’ve gotten help several times which helps for a while but I always go back to square one afterwards.  

Where I live it is extremely hard to get any mh support unless you pay for it yourself which I can’t afford. I have been on a mh waiting list to see someone again for 2.5 years with no answer. 

I don’t want to live anymore. I wish I could afford to move away and start a fresh life somewhere else. Nobody is going to want me being a virgin this old, having bpd and possibly having a terminal illness. The only friends I have are online and when I have tried to make friends in person, I always get ghosted or my anxiety gets too much and I end up cancelling on them. 

I have decided against ever having children because of my illnesses and situation. I’m not pretty, I’m slightly overweight, constantly exhausted from being so anxious and I’m stuck in this loop forever. I have no way out.

something to live for,"I've always been a dreamer. As a child I sometimes spent hours in my room just imagining what life could be like one day. I loved reading, writing, acting, because choosing one path in life just wasn't good enough for me, I wanted it all. That's how much I loved life. Then I became depressed. After years of depressive episodes I've been on a recovery journey since last year and rn I feel as good as I haven't felt in forever. But there is one thing that's still missing: a dream. Something that excites me, makes me want to get up in the morning, something I want to live for. I wonder if losing this is just part of growing up. But then again, I don't want to live without dreams. Without something to strive for. How do you get that back? All that I loved to do or aspired to do one day, nowadays just makes me feel neutral.

I’m so lost,"Probably nothing surprising here, but I really just need to have my thoughts out. If I end up killing myself soon, it may give some insight so it’s not just the “no one could have predicted this” BS. Everything is a mess. People keep asking me for updates on aspects of my life and I just have to lie and say things are fine. But they’re not. I have no fucking clue what’s going on. I’m behind on everything but I don’t have the energy to fix it. I’m just so tired all the time. I get enough sleep, but I’m still so exhausted constantly. I don’t have the energy to do the daily tasks most people seem to be capable of. I’ve gone to doctors and they say I’m healthy. But if I’m healthy, then why do I have to lie on the bakery floor partway through my shifts otherwise I’ll pass out? Thoughts of killing myself are happening more intensely now. Where as before I would just passively think about suicide, it’s now at the forefront of my mind and I’m this close to just doing it. I’m with my family stuck in a gas station parking lot for the night in the middle of nowhere right now. And I really want to just walk off into the desert. I don’t want anyone to find me. I don’t want them to have a funeral for me. I don’t want them looking at me and crying thinking what they could have done better like they did at my cousins funeral a few months ago. I just want to  be gone. Like I never existed. Since I can’t seem to do anything right. I used to be a straight A student, and now I’m failing all my classes because I can’t function like a normal human. My friends see me as the person they can turn to when they need help. The person who remembers birthdays. The person who will make them a home cooked meal. The person who will help them with homework. But they forget my birthday. They offer support, but never any actual support. I ask for help, and they forget… my partner is such a kind person but I just don’t love them anymore. And the thought of breaking their heart just makes my anxiety over life so much worse. 
There’s so much more but it’s probably nothing new here. 
I don’t know. I’m just sick of life like this. I think about the best case scenario and I just realize that life doesn’t have any meaning. There isn’t any point to continue existing.

The only thing stopping me is the idea of my family grieving,"I’m 17f and have been dealing with suicidal ideation on and off for years. I started recently with a therapist where I suggested inpatient therapy as an option, which she refused to entertain because she thinks I don’t need it. Lately I’ve been dealing with a recent breakup and the death of my childhood dog, which have exacerbated things but were definitely not the source of my ideation by any means. I’m at my breaking point now because (~3 weeks) after my breakup with my ex 18m my friends have started ignoring and excluding me. My ex broke up with me initially because he said he was exhausted with my extremely intense emotions, mood swings, and depression which was an extremely deep cut because he was the person I trusted the most to confide in these things with. I loved him and when I hit a low point after my dog died he said he couldn’t be with me anymore. I’ve been working through it slowly for the last three weeks, and for the last three weeks I’ve tried to turn to my friends to lean on because it’s been so difficult and the indifference and coldness from the person I trusted the most has been salt in the wound. Initially they were supportive enough, but now they are excluding me, ignoring me, and giving up on any effort necessary to maintain our friendship. I worry that my ex is perpetuating to them that I’m a terrible person that they shouldn’t be around and they’re all cutting me out because of it, we have a lot of mutual friends since long before we were dating. I’m just so confused because when we broke up he said he cared about me and hoped my mental state could improve on my own. He made it very clear that there was no bad blood between us and that it just wasn’t working. I don’t understand and I don’t have anyone to talk to because I have lost every single person I thought I could count on for help or advice or even just a fucking hug. I want to die more than anything else, I have the means to kill myself in my house and I could do it tonight, but the idea of my mom blaming herself and my dad, brother, sister, grandpa, cousins, having to bury me holds me back. They’ve never been great shoulders to cry on and are honestly some of the last people i would go to with my problems but i still love them to death and i don’t want to die knowing they’re going to grieve me.

Wish I could get over my fear of pain,"I once again have found myself looking into exit bags and OD medications. The other simpler, n the moment methods just scare me to much with the pain that you’ll endure during or even after if I’m unsuccessful. I wish I could look past the physical pain, and accept that it’s a small price to pay to end lifelong agony that awaits me. Bipolar is too much wait to bear for me, and the loved ones around me. I can tell my friends, colleagues and work management hate me now. They can’t stand my lack of communication of missing work, events, or other things. I reach out, and no support that they can give helps me. I just wish to die, a quiet and soft death. 

I wish I was brain dead, just a vat of meat that goes through the day, outside of the reality of my tired heart. I continue to hurt the ones who care about me. Just broke up with my partner in a manic episode and yearn to ask for help from them, but I can’t hurt them again. Then I think of the one who got away years ago, and I think of her everyday. I can’t even say that her hating me is a personal delusion, people have told me, she’s told me. I’m a selfish asshole, ‘fuck you’, ‘how could anyone love you’. I don’t know how anyone could either. I can’t reach out to her, and I know my friends resent the way I’ve treated both her and my most recent partner. I think it’s time for me to rot in the ground, or sink to bottom of a river. Just let me free. I’m planning on buying the helium tank tomorrow if I can afford it. I’ll pull into an alleyway close by the store and put the bag on my head. I’m ready to go.

"Life is a joke, and a bad one at that","Well, periodically I end up posting back here, whenever I feel like things getting better, shit always end up hitting the fan somehow.

I'm convinced that we are just brought into this planet to make other's lives miserable for no reason. If my own family isn't willing to support the real me, how can I be sure that the rest of people will accept me?

Whenever I find a semblance of happiness, there's always some douchbag gleefully awaiting the moment to take that from me. The idiot of my father doesn't have empathy for me and still claims that he loves me. I didn't get to choose to be born the way I am, I didn't have a choice about the decisions I took. It was either ""that"" or killing myself, thing that I'm really considering again.

I've been dealt a shitty hand and people around me have somehow made my hand worse. If my experiences taught me something, it's that transitioning isn't hell, people around you make it seem like hell.

So picture this, you need to get over your own dysphoric thoughts and also tolerate the insensitive comments of the people that are supposed to love you the most.

I'm stuck living as a dude while doing hrt and my fucking environment won't let me to socially transition. Fucking conservative Catholics, I despise them, they literally put my family against me with their idiotic ideologies. For them I'm nothing more than a dude wanting to wear dresses or a weirdo.

If I could just move out I would have done it by now, but my salary is so shitty and rents are so ludicrously high that that's not an option. I feel trapped in my own body and trapped by my environment, I just want out.

I'm so depressed that I would gladly take my life or someone else's in the process. I'm so angry and resented at everything that I would like to watch the whole world burn.

I wouldn't wish my situation upon anyone, it's literal torture and also to add insult to injury, I was ""suggested"" to leave hormones for a year. Do you know how that would affect me? I would literally snap faster as my mental health would take an even worse nosedive. I've tried it before so I know by personal experience that it's a terrible idea.

So to wrap up my torture porn biography, I may end up or being homeless or deleting myself. Idk, at this point I don't care, I just want to be left alone.",Cool_Refrigerator370,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4wo3v/life_is_a_joke_and_a_bad_one_at_that/

I’m only living to go to therapy,"My dad gets drunk nearly every night and picks verbal fights with me, only me out of my mom and younger sister. He has such high expectations for me that once I got a c (my lowest ever semester grade) and he started talking with my mom about how disappointed he was with me, as if I wasn’t there. He clearly doesn’t love me, because it’s a repeated pattern. He even told me “then I don’t love you” a couple of weeks ago when I stopped him from committing but didn’t want to hug him. He clearly doesn’t trust me, and doesn’t respect me when I’ve done nothing but earn and deserve both. He makes snide comments about my body, and if I get (or have) an eating disorder it’s completely his fault.

I'm losing the will to live,"I have a huge credit card debt that I am unable to pay. The collectors are all bugging me profoundly. I am overwhelmed and drained. But I have no other means. This has been going on for months and I was doing my best to cope. Thoughts of ending my life to escape it have visited my mind occassionally but I set it aside and continue to live.

While I was struggling, I found out last week that I am being evicted in my permanent residence since I haven't fully paid the lot. What is more painful though is that neighbors and local officials produced documents containing fallacious information about me so they can have the lot.

It is awful. I was starting to relapse. Thinking more about death but I decided I'll try to fight today. But upon waking up, I received news that one of the collectors called our HR Department! I feel so ashamed! Now, I keep thinking of death many times. I couldn't handle the pressure, the anxiety! One problem after the other!

What is painful is this.. I am sure no one will understand. People will assume that I am in huge debt and broke because I am some irresponsible spendthrift. But they don't know that...

I am in huge debt because the main contributing factor was my shopping/hoarding/collecting addiction from 2021-2023...

I got shopping addiction because my depression and anxiety intensified...

My depression and anxiety intensified because of acquired bipolar disorder...

I acquired bipolar disorder because my husband abused me emotionally and financially for 19 years and he abandoned me last 2020...

Now he is living like a rich bachelor kid because he is an only son and heir while I live in misery. I couldn't file a case against him because I couldn't afford it financially and mentally. (We have no divorce and annulment, the only option, is very expensive and a brutal fight).

I am extremely frustrated and I feel hopeless. Plus when I explain to people I have BD and/or I am depressed, they just brush it off like I am just sad or I have fever. They also do not realized how my husband fucked up my life, my family, my dreams. How he took away my health, my beauty, my youth.

Got prescribed lunesta (rant),"I (23f) am in a major depressive episode due to a shitty life situation and also because I’ve had depression on and off since I was 10. My usual SSRI (Paxil), which I’ve taken for nearly 10 years isn’t helping at all anymore. I’ve tried Wellbutrin, which I hated because it made me tired for some reason and I didn’t feel comfortable taking something that could cause weight loss (literally was 93 pounds at the time he prescribed it so no idea why he thought that was a good idea). Mirtazapine, which is way too sedating even at a high dose (we’re talking sleeping 17 hours). Mirtazapine didn’t have any positive effects on my mood and honestly made me feel worse. But it got me to a normal weight so I at least feel better about my body.

My depression puts me in a perpetual state of exhaustion, but it makes it hard to fall asleep at night. Once I’m asleep, I easily sleep 8+ hours and it’s hard to get up. Apparently my psychiatrist only heard “can’t fall asleep” and prescribed Lunesta. I cancelled the prescription immediately once I found out what it was. He didn’t explain any of the dangers or that it was a controlled substance.

I am literally incapable of feeling positive emotions right now. I’m incapable of feeling joy, and doing things I like. I can’t feel happiness or love. Everything makes me sad and I feel numb. All I feel is darkness and I’m tired of feeling like this.

I'm quite tired. I can literally feel the absolute mental exhaustion seeping into my body. Imagine those spells in video games that sap your stamina or your life force. It's like I've been living under the influence of something like that for years. Only my tank is empty now.

When I speak to someone, I can sense myself dissociating. I watch myself say dumb or insensitive things and ruin a potential friendship.

I have multiple expenses and thats why I dont fix cosmetic things plus I dont think it matters. I have a nice smile and my teeth are not yellow they are white but no enamel.

I have $2700 of damage from an ice sliding accident on my vehicle and more inside. 

I have greys in the top of my head. And I often limp or waddle bc of chronic pain as well as bad sleep making my skin dark under eyes etc.

And Im frustrated that all this stuff make me not allowed to socialize. Everyone rejects me. And just seems to criticise things that just DONT MATTER. None if my teeth are rotting or look like what youre thinking. Oh and always dry lios from the medical and well all my life. I do masks and more it just doesnt change.

How am I supposed to make my life happen when people just reject me for looks or other reasons that are out of my control. All my spending money goes to medical treatment trying to improve myself and these conditions. 

I dont think I can keep fighting it alone. Whats the point if Im treated like a bum when Im not a bum. In my garage in my building and when you try to fill them in or discuss it they just go “I dont remember sayign that” and it was last time. And you try to address it anyways.

I feel like my entire life is just so scientists have an ""average human"" to compare others to. Hell, everything about me is average it feels like. I'm average height, average weight, average at everything. The only things I have going for me is also things that lead to me being discriminated against, which make me stay inside all days and not get close to anyone.

I do absolutely nothing with my life beyond going to work and existing. Every so often I'll go and do something fun, but it feels like the second I leave I just go back to baseline. I feel like I should be doing more, there's so much I want to do and I just can't.

People don't like me because they can't ever relate to me. I can't ever relate to them. So I have almost no friends. I can't even tell you what I did all day today. Genuinely, it's been maybe 12 hours of me being awake and I can only tell you enough things to fill an hour. Everything else has just blended into the rest of my life.

And fuck, most of my depression isn't even about myself. I'm trans so I have to just live with the knowledge that I'll either end up homeless, jobless, a sex worker, raped, or killed. And that's not an exaggeration either, it's likely I'll end up being at least one of those things. The fact that none of that has happened to me yet is genuinely lucky.

I need someone who understands me,"My entire life, no one has understood me. Not my family, not my friend, not my wife, nor anyone I've been told to seek help from. I cannot accept the world the way it is. It is not simply ""the way the world works"" for me, because ""the way the world works"" is what depresses me. There is a price tag for what one needs to survive, there is a price tag to fix the world's problems, or how much the GDP is of a planet/star system we have never visited. 

I have spent a large majority of my life watching or learning from Fight Club. My father kicked me out to be alone for years, and the cynicism from both my friend and what I learned from Fight Club changed who I am as a person. 

No one can understand why I am so depressed when people have ot worse. The fact that people have it worse than I do is why I am depressed. 

Idk if the words I am using are good enpugh to express what I feel. But I know I am not alone. Please, I need someone... please...

the desire to not exist for a bit,"so, hi, i just woke up from a sleep that i have been struggling to fix lately .

(since i have been staying up all night for the past few months, i decided to change it last night and i did wake up 2 times under a 2 hr interval but its all good)

i woke up the 2nd time and i decided to not go back to sleep immediately in order to write this clutching thought of mine so i could get some peace:

'i don't want to exist for a while'

stil looms over my head a few months ago and grew ever more strongly these past few weeks . 

with repetitive days coming by (days feeling like it doesnt progress, but rather loops), problems, responsibilities, and things you hate about 'life' coming onto you like a landslide of some sorts. yeah, its taken a toll on me mentally.

i could summarize it as just me losing it and losing interest in life as my philosophy has definitely circled around itself as 'there's not much significance to be around' anymore i say.

i grew up in an okay religious family and i was treated okay, finances are okay and etc. so definitely not a family problem .

lol idk what 2 write anymore definitely, i ran out of fuel or i just simply lost interest anymore in continuing this as suppose to my enthuaism earlier in the first few sentences of this post.

it hurts, i don't want to be something or someone, i don't want to feel anxious everyday, feel pressured everyday, and sad everyday whenever i see or think of myself.

I wanna go back home...,"Hello (14M), growing up as a child who has adhd and living in an unsafe environment with plenty of kids, even adults making fun of me. Here, my abusive and alcoholic dad who physically abused me because of my disabilities has ruined my brain permanently.

He went to rehab for 2 years back in 2020... When he got back i thought it was over now... Till he cheated on my mom... And when she found out... She confronted her...

They fought... Infront of me... We were eating dinner that time... They don't even know i was there... It's just screaming and yelling... As i eat...

They didn't get a divorce... Instead they just lived in our house without talking to each other... Some other fights along the way...

They eventually sort it out and decided to live in a much safer area... I was extremely happy that time when i heard that I'll be leaving the place I almost died on...

When we moved... I made plenty of friends along the way and even went in a band... I hit puberty there... It was good... The place is quiet... It's a safe place for me... if only I can live there for the rest of my life... I can't tho...

2 years had passed, 2024. Turns out that my parents are going to sell the house and we need to go back from that shitty place I used to live on...

My whole world shattered... My stomach dropped... All the healing I did... Gone in a blink of an eye... I begged for them not to do it but they did... I wished it was dream... My friends... My school... My home... They took it away from me...

When we got back to our house... I get frequent flashbacks from the past... It felt so uncomfortable... It felt... Scary... I can't believe I'm back here... Even the school i transferred to... It's haunted... I'm scared of what's going to happen to me here...

Present day, i don't go out anymore... I drown myself on caffeine... Like energy drinks and coffee... I only go out when I have to... Like school, buying stuff from the grocery... I sometimes wish i was dead already and if i should just end it all... I think I'm doing a pretty good job of doing things that could kill me... Like drinking as much energy drinks asi can... not sleeping for 3 days... sleeping in the bathroom... but these doesn't do its job... I'm still fine... 

I go and tried to change the look of my room... And threw out the things that reminded me of the past... But I still get it... My mind is going crazy... This is torture for me... The only way I can interact to my friends is through online...i really miss them... I cry almost every night... It's my 5th month here... 

I got myself my first girlfriend... But that didn't end well and I just got mad at her suddenly and started calling her names and other hurtful stuff... I regret doing that... I didn't know why I even did that... I just came out of me... We only got together for 2 months and my unstable sense of self has led me to push her away... And regret it 3 hrs after when it's too late...

I failed almost every of my class but still manage to be able to go through the next school year... Next week I will be in 10th grade now...

I'm aching just to feel like home... Back to where i belong... I didn't know that... Happiness is temporary... But you can't force yourself to be happy... You have to find what makes you happy... But I can't...

Wanting to die at 29 after 4 years relationship ended,"Sorry if my english is not good, I’m european. I don't usually write personal things on Reddit but I really need to get this out because I have no one.

I was with my ex for 4 years, until February this year. I'm 28 (almost 29) and she's 32. These 4 years we always had a good time and we did a lot of things together. We shared a lot of interests: anime, video games, love of animals, volleyball. We attended the same volleyball team and over the course of these 4 years her friends also became mine; I have never had many friends, in fact practically none, whereas with them I had found a group of emotionally intelligent, funny people with whom, together with her, we met to role-play every weekend. 

Then in the last year the situation started to go badly.
For a variety of reasons related to our respective situations at home, she no longer came to my house, and I no longer went to her house. Specifically, I no longer went to her house because her retired mother was always there smoking and we didn't have a shred of privacy, she didn't come to me because my house was always either too cold in the winter or too hot in the winter. summer, because while studying at university I didn't have the money to pay the heating or air conditioning bills.

The problem was that she simply seemed to have accepted the fact that we could only see each other once a week, on the weekend, and only with our (her) friends. The more I asked for a solution to be able to carve out time for ourselves too, the more she told me that, due to the situation at our homes, this was not possible. Punctually when I brought up this topic we argued, because I seemed insistent, and it seemed absurd to me that she considered a relationship based only on this.

Sex was gone.
We went from doing it less and less, to doing it once every month and a half/two, until we didn't do it anymore from June last year until November. 

She just didn't seem to feel the need to spend time alone with me. We saw each other either at volleyball, or with her friends.

In November last year, after yet another argument, we took a break, in which we continued to see each other only as friends doing the usual things, that is, seeing each other at volleyball and on Saturday evenings at our friends' house.
During this break I thought a lot about the situation, and I was ready to change to start again for the better, but in February she instead told me that she no longer wanted to continue, and that if I wanted at most we could just remain friends, because being together as a couple it made her feel bad.

This thing literally broke me open and made me a non-functioning human being.

I loved this girl and I still love her, I wanted to build a life and have children together.

I left the volleyball team and the group of friends because hearing or seeing her again made me feel too bad, so now I'm completely alone. 
I have no friends, I have no family, I have no girlfriend, I have nothing. 
I see a psychologist every two weeks but it isn't helping me at all. 

Since February I have done nothing but work, come home and stay in bed, I no longer function as a human being. All I do is think about what I could have done better to prevent her from leaving me. I'm eating out of regulation and staying in bed all day. I finish work (remote work), I throw myself into bed, stare at the PC until late at night and start a new day like this, uninterruptedly, since February.
At almost 30 years old I feel completely finished.

Yesterday I indirectly discovered that she is seeing another person.

I just want to kill myself, I can't live like this anymore. I feel like im in a movie theatre after the movie has ended, watching the shut off screen in the dark. 

I’m planning to hang myself with a rope by september.",hawkeyeninefive,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e345y5/wanting_to_die_at_29_after_4_years_relationship/
I try my best every day but I wish I didn't have to,"I think the way you are as a child sets the tone for the rest of your life no matter what you try because if you were depressed and had low self worth at age 8 no matter what you try the moment you let it go for a minute you will be back to being that kid 

It’s kind of like if you were a fat kid you can get ripped but you will always have low metabolism and always be at risk of going back to how u were if you stop trying ur best every day. It's hard coded inside and the moment the page refreshes ur back to square one. 

I try very hard. I try to be the best version of myself every day. But even now, when I am so far from being the kid I was back then, I still feel the same. None of my peers would guess I am as depressed as I am because you wouldn't think someone like me would be. Outwardly I try my best to be extroverted and confident to get away from the kid I used to be. But on the inside, Im just trying so so hard to pass as a normal person. Every night I think terrible things about myself and consider ending it. I know I won't do it because I have responsibilities but the thoughts are always there.

I wish I didn't have to try so hard. I wish this wasn't just my natural state of being. Idk if I should blame how my parents treated me or blame being an only child or blame my sexual/gender orientation or I don't fucking know. but its really true that even in kindergarten I never fit in and was always sadder than the other kids.

A misunderstanding that took me downhill,"Hey there friends. Idk where should i really put this, but i really need to vent out to somebody at 1 am in the morning, a heavy heart pounding that keeps getting louder as time progress , staring aimlessly at the dark ceiling of my room, listening to the constant crickets and he distant barks through the window. I'm an 18M, and would probably be graduating in due time. I have antisocial and have an extreme anxiety as of late, and i have been depressed for nearly 6 months now. Ever since then, my life has been a constant downhill, and it looks like that it wouldn't be stopping. To the eyes of someone not close to me, I appear to be content with life and being able to help people in any way i can. Now, I just don't know anymore.

There are certainly a number of factors in why I have been depressed. But i want to discuss right now is what would eventually turn into losing of my closest friends. I have a feeling that in due time i will be losing all of my best friends, and it will be because of all of my wrongdoings. On our friend group, I was unknowingly making offensive jokes, thinking that it was that on that stage of being friends where we could tell some jokes and would just laugh it off. Without me knowing until recently, I have actually been offending one of my female friends that we would call ""Jewel"" for the time being
















It all started about 10 months ago, i was just starting a sense of depression feels like. Ever since grade school, I haven't made the one that i can truly call a friend since I have been switching schools every 3 years. When I went to my 11th grade, I only have 1 goal: to have tons of friends whom i could bond with even if we go separate ways to our dream colleges and future careers (ik my goal is a bit cliche but stay with me on this one). On the 1st month, I have met my future best friend, that for the sake of anonymity, we will call him ""Alan."" Alan was like the brother I never had. We had a lot of a common interest, and would be even be not exaggerating to call it too much. From the shows we watch, the games we play, hell even our music taste are the same! I couldn't have asked for a better friend like him.

Back to the topic at hand, at the height of my depression, Alan was the first one I have reached out to talk about it. I was really anxious and scared on what to tell him because this would be my first time opening up to someone. In the end, Alan comforted me on one of my toughest times and said to me that he'll be always avaliable.

"My lazyness has caught up to me, and now I feel completely hopeless and empty.","I have to be the most empty person on the planet.

It’s a long story to how I got to this point, but I was extremely selfish and lazy as a child, and completely lacked any social skills (still fail in that regard)

I had zero real friends in middle and high school since I was so easily angered and couldn’t even initiate a conversation, I lacked any and all empathy for others, and due to my after school job in my last two years, I couldn’t do any extracurricular activities.

Sadly, I completely wasted my college years feeling scared I wasn’t going to pass for every moment of every day, and barely ever did anything else but cope behind a screen alone when I wasn’t studying. The pandemic really put me into this habit, and I sadly never got out of it. I had zero friends and wasn’t able to get any experience. I literally cried out of hopelessness during my graduation ceremony a year ago, and had to move back in with my parents. I was unemployed for months until finally getting a full time beginner job, which I now can’t stand, and I have completely lost interest in my major (i already felt such way during my final year of college)

It’s been slightly a year since my graduation, and my attention span for any sort of productivity is so low that I just spend any time out of work crying and feeling empty thinking about how I messed up so badly.

A few weekends ago, I came to a full realization about how everything went so wrong and have told myself I will change, but since then I haven’t even been able to put in the effort to find someone to help me.

M17 regret when I was 15,"When I was 15 I was watching an anime and I found one character attractive \[people in the anime look older than they are\] which was 11. I wasn’t sure if that was pedophilic so I checked on internet and dsm-5 something said someone needs to be 16 and for it to be 5+ years. I did the bad thing then thinking it wasn’t bad since the characters looks older and it “wasn’t” creepy. Year ago when I was 16 i remembered that and I got really uncomfortable thinking about it. I am now 17 and I feel insane disgust and I feel so sick. At the time I was 15 I was 🌽 addict and 4yr age gaps were “normal” where I live. I still have no idea why I listened to that source and thought it was okay, I feel so sick today and I am so against grooming anyone, even tho character was fictional I feel insane regret.

I’ve tried to lay down but my heart won’t stop racing. I live in the middle of nowhere, have really shitty job that only schedules me for 4 hour shifts and pays 12 an hour and my schedule is never consistent or a full week. My car’s rear seal is busted and it won’t hold oil any more. The last time I put some oil in there was so much smoke everywhere. So I’ve been relying on people within our community to get me to and from work, over a month late on rent. Lawn is overgrown got no mower, landscaper hasn’t shown up despite putting me on the schedule 3 weeks ago. New meds are killing me, I wish I can find the list of all the meds I’ve been on through out the last 9 years. And the worst part is I’ve turned to alcohol to numb it all. I just can’t make anything work and follow through. I keep making the worst decisions. I know this all sounds like complaining, but to make matters much much worse is seeing all of you struggling with life too. Everyone’s got their own story or nightmares going on and it hurts my heart to see you all in pain. I’m so sorry everyone’s experiencing what they are. This world is relentless and depression is the worst thing that could have ever happened to all of us. Oh and our electric is so past due we’re getting shut off on the 17th.

I just want to escape ,"Sorry for my bad English! I hope you guys are having great Sunday! 

Ive had anxiety about my future. Im not allowed to be wrong or have mistake on myself. I wanted to be perfect and I ruined the day when I made mistakes. but I could overcome them because my ex bf gave me great energy. He did nothing tbh - just seeing and talking to him, it gave me great energy 

Recently, he broke up with me out of the blues. He has been depressed since January so I suggested him to see therapist and he did but he is prescribed antidepressants since June. After that, he became rude, aggressive - totally different person. He was dream and world to me but he just left me. On March we were on break for 2 weeks and we solved everything well. I was the only one who knew his problem and depression and I was for him when he needed but now there is no one near me. Luckily, my parents understand me but I have no friends 

I’m worried and scared of everything about my future and myself.  I feel like I can’t get a job and can’t find any friends and ppl who love me. And I’ve felt guilty for my ex bf. I just want to escape from this situation. I just miss my happy moments but I’m sure I can’t have moments like before. I just hate myself.

Exhausted. Need Advice.,"Hello.

I am a 31 year old female. All of my life I have suffered from severe inattentive ADHD and depression.  Victim of a narcissistic toxic family, labeled the black sheep. FF to my adult life. Survivor of domestic violence, then later unrelated a violent rape. 2 years ago now almost 3 I lost custody of my son. He is 9 now.  I see him every Wednesday, Friday, and every other Saturday. The coparent is a narcissist who is extremely controlling and if it is not their way its no ones way. Always in the public eye, the one with the most money, never follows the order, constantly filling my child's head with manipulative bullshit. When its good its great but it always fleeting always temporary.     Over the past 9 years so many times I  have thought about finality.    I won't elaborate on that I think most of you can understand it.   

  
I want to change. I am so tired of living life this way. I am constantly physical exhausted, agitated, or just ready to give up.  The only time I feel any shred of happiness is when I am with my son or get to hear his voice on the phone. He is the only thing that keeps me going.   I am a first responder.  I am in RN school.   I start in August.   I want to get on a medication to help with my ADHD so that I can focus but also a medication that will help with my depression giving me energy, purpose and drive to get up and DO things throughout the day. On top of everything I severe anxiety.   I have tried so many different medications and want to know if anyone has any recommendations.   I am well aware that everyone is different and everyone responds differently.  I am going to respectfully ask the reddit community to not comment things like ""You need to talk to your doctor"" or ""Everyone responds to medication differently"".  I want to know what works for you.   I am going to list the medications that I have tried here and the side effects that I have had: 

Strattera-Currently on it. Not giving up just yet. Seriously bad anxiety. 40mg

Vyvanse: 20mg love it until it starts to wear off. Hype focusing. Make just get back on it.

Lexapro: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Trileptal: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Effexor XR: Very bad depression and a serious almost police involved attempt.

Trintellix: Bitchy and agitated

Cymbalta or Duloxetine: Serious anxiety for the first month of taking to the point where I had to get off.

Citalopram: Have been on it. Don't really remember it but I think anxiety.

Caplyta: Crave sweets, weird dreams, crying spells

Clonazepam(Klonopin) Currently take PRN

Ativan: Serious memory issues.

Xanax: Depression.

Buspirone: Very bad headache did not manage anxiety effectively

Vistaril: Laughable did absolutely noting for my anxiety. Made my nose extremely dry. 

Those are all of the ones that I remember taking.  I need recommendations based purely on what has worked for others on antidepressants and ADHD medication. Thank you!",Icy-Turnip-9679,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3ggfu/exhausted_need_advice/
I have major depression propably ptsd,"Recently figured out i have depression from ptsd. Traumatic childhood didnt make the transition into adulthood any easier. Especially when I never wanted to grow up to begin with, or have a dead end job. It is just not me. But I was neglected and never got the support i needed emotionally or whatever. Lived in a seemingly unloving home without my mom for 8 years. Ever since i was 16 i have been depressed numb and emotionless melancoly. Never happy. Just sad. Getting help soon but it is well overdue, and i dont know what help i will get. I just have too big aspirations for life it feels like. I feel like I wont find love in a long time. My friends arent really there for my emotionally. Idk i just feel like life has been an uphill battle since i was 11. Im 23 now. Havent really made any progress still live at home no job experience. I just feel stupid for my choices sometimes. I feel unloved by my parents because i dont think they have the emotional intelligence to even be there for me. My dreams seems just like that dreams. I dont have that fight in me for life and hope to push through to a better life. I have given up in a sense. But i have major depression so i cant barely showr go out or anything. Plus im an socially anxious person. I dont know why im writing today but I feel lonely and unloved and tired of holding out. I need healing. And I know you need too. 🤍 hope you get there.

Also i have been emotionally stunted, i think it is getting a little better but i have been feeling like 5 years old all my adolescense and adulthood.

"Once all is done, I stop and Therapy Problems","I've been going outside, exercised and have eaten for three straight days. I don't know what to do afterwards though. I like gaming and writing but I'm too tired to do any of that once those three things have been finished. I'm improving but I still struggle a lot mentally and physically. Medication helps somewhat and therapy is... okay. 

What I don't understand is the phrases on the wall about the therapist keeping info private. 

Like: It will remain a secret unless you have thoughts of hurting yourself/others or given permission that it's okay to share. I... have those thoughts a lot and it wasn't taken super seriously. 
""If you don't have a plan of doing it, then it's okay.""

Like, bitch! This is fucking serious! Why are you not taking any action?!

They don't give me advice. They just say try [specific thing] during the week, which... I don't follow through. When I tell them things, they're always like 
""Gotcha"" or ""I understand"". 

It honestly just frustrates me since it took so long to actually get into therapy and I can't go by myself. I'm kinda lost in what to do.

The main reason for this post is a dream I had. A dream about my ex girlfriend. It was just a memory ig from when we were kissing. I barely remember the dream but ik what day it was. It's blurry as hell. Now the issue: my head is so fucked it keeps telling me that the girl I was kissing wasn't my ex but my little sister? It's so random. I remember exactly that incident when we (me and ex) kissed in that exact position and manner so why is this happening? Now that memory has been fogged over by this shit and i can only see my little sister. I see her every day so it's making me guilty as hell. I hate myself more than ever. Am i just entirely a psychopath? I would never do that filth to my sister, so why is my head making it as though i did in that dream?

Why do I wake up every single morning with suicidal ideations? ,"Why do I wake up every single morning with suicidal ideations?

Genuinely what’s the point ,"Everyone just leaves in the end without fail. No one has ever really liked me, my best friend of over 10 years stopped talking to me for no reason, I tried to arrange a day out with another “friend” recently and they just left me on delivered for days so it never happened. I’ve had friends before but I was always the last choice, the one who was walking behind everyone, the one no one really cares if they’re there or not. No one comes by to visit, no one calls, no one asks me how I’m doing, no one cares. There’s something about me people just don’t like, something so deeply imbedded into me. It has to be a me problem because it’s such a strong trend in my life. 

I don’t enjoy anything anymore, nothing feels good, video games are boring to me now. I don’t have any hobbies, I don’t have anyone to go out with, I just sit in my room and bed rot. 
Nothing is enjoyable. I either feel empty or my emotions smother me. I mainly just feel angry or sad and it’s just too much, I feel too weak to experience my emotions. There is nothing for me in this life, everyday that goes by I just get increasingly more frustrated at life, more nihilistic, more misanthropic. I don’t want to be like this but I can’t escape my mind. 

I’m so so jealous of those who have relatively “normal” lives. Friends, not poor, good mental health. Why not me? I wish I had just ended it all those years ago, I really fucking wish I did.

Nothing matters anyways ,"I just need to get it out of my system.

I'm exhausted all the time because I put so much into this stupid job and I don't have time for myself to rest or care for myself the way I need. I'm just the worst person alive is all I've learned and I just want to kill myself and be done with it.

That's not living, it's just torture.

  
I don't have friends, the little family I have hates me. I don't do anything and never have. I don't bring value to anyone or anything and I never have and never will. If I was gone there wouldn't be any negative change at all.

  
The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I don't want my mom to lose her only blood relative, though I suppose she'd still have my brother even though they don't get along as well.

Haven't felt this bad in a long time,"I (M33) been feeling really down for the last couple of years, and, as a stress eater, I gained about 15 kgs since the pandemic/parenthood. As I wanted to tackle the root problem, i.e. my depression, I consulted with my GP, and she prescribed Lexapro, which I took for about 1.5 years. Unfortunately, this made me gain another 15 kgs. (I'm 180cm and went from weighing 80kg to a massive 110kg) Mentally, I didn't feel that depressed anymore though, apart from the fact that the added weight took a massive toll on my self conscience. So a couple months back I decided to quit Lexapro, did so successfully and started taking care of my body some more: I started eating healthy (keto) and about 10 days ago I bought a fitbit and started doing 10k steps per day... I felt so good as I finally started to really shed some weight (the keto helped, but combined with the walking, it went way faster)... However, since a few days my lower legs started hurting every time I'd go for a walk, and today it was so bad I had to return home after about 10 minutes. I feel so bummed out and haven't felt this bad / sad / depressed in a long long time, years actually. I feel so hopeless...

In this dream (every dream) I meet someone special and end up developing a connection with them. I am a person that does not attract women so having sex dreams is a whole different level.

The abilities make me feel so free and happy I don’t wanna wake up. I catch myself trying to fall back asleep and continue the dream, and it works sometimes.

Wondering about apathy ,"Hello everyone.

I'm 27 years old, and I've been dealing with depression since 11 I think. I am diagnosed, but the diagnosis came when I was like 20 or so.

On my daily life I don't have a lot of struggles I'd say, nor do I have any suicidal thoughts (never had). I can't really cry either, the last time was years and years ago, spontaneously while hugging my sister.

Anyways, I decided to make this post because I have a question. I feel like I have a severe case of apathy. I don't care about almost anything except of my family, I have no desires, basically no plans for the future. I'm just existing, like I'm on some kind of limbo.

It feels awful but at the same time it feels like... The thought of going back to being healthy (although I don't remember how that was) sounds false. It sounds like a lie. After experiencing all this emptiness and apathy, the idea of having a fulfilling life simply sounds fake, like turning a blind eye to all of this. Does anyone feels the same?",Aladiah,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1x8ts/wondering_about_apathy/
For the past 5 months I’ve woken up depressed and wishing i just die in my sleep. ,"This year has been the worst year for me. I had to leave the city that I loved, along with the community and friends I had, and move back home due to visa issues and my parents' health. I’m now faced with the possibility of changing careers (I worked in film) to support my wife and child, as it's not stable or lucrative here. This might mean abandoning my dream of becoming a film director due to external pressures( i come from a conservative community so film is looked down upon), and I’ve been feeling like a failure seeing all my old friends and relatives in higher positions while I struggle to stay financially afloat every day.

I thought this would be the year I finally made the film I worked so hard to write and assemble a team for (I've been pretending that I’m doing well and have just been focused on my film this year). However, it’s been impossible to juggle my dreams with having a family, addressing my parents' needs, finishing our house repairs, finding a potential job to make money, working on my film, and dealing with other personal emotional problems. 

This year, everything has fallen apart, and it has felt like a battle. Nothing has been simple, and I’m tired. I tried following my dreams, but I’m starting to doubt my abilities and whether I’ll ever reach where I want to be in life or be able to give my family the life they deserve. Maybe I’m too old to make it; maybe I missed my chance. 

I imagine life would be easier if my wife had married someone else and not me, a failed artist, or if I died so they could move on without needing to support me and my unrealistic dreams and expectations in life, maybe i’m just another failed dreamer that wasn’t tough enough to go all they way or able to sacrifice to make his dreams real because i’m weak... it doesn’t matter anymore i just want to kill all my ambitions, goals and dreams so i make life easier for myself and everyone around me.

Contemplating SH and Overdose,"I don't know what to say here really, and this is really a stream of consciousness post.  I just feel so lonely and unloved right now, and emotionally numb.  I SH'd in the past when I was like this, and it broke that deadlock of feeling dead inside.  But I felt so ashamed afterwards. That feeling is calling to me again, but I'm too scared to act and I feel pathetic and like a coward for that.

I'm autistic, but high functioning, and I have suffered from depression and anxiety for years.  I feel so lost and out of place, and so incredibly lonely.  I just want to feel something, anything, but I'm honestly terrified of to act on my thoughts.  I'm on meds for anxiety and depression, and I can't stop the thoughts of downing whatever I have left.

Going to work is such a struggle.  Having to pretend I'm OK and still perform my job is so fucking hard, and not a day goes by where I feel like quitting.

I just want to be happy and feel loved.  But I feel like that's not for me, and I'm terrified of going on like this.  I have had good moments in the past, but the bad greatly outweighs the good.  I've never been in any kind of relationship, and as a guy in his 30s I feel so infantilised because of it (in my own mind at least).

I feel shame at the thought of leaving family and the few friends I have, but also feel like I can't go on like this.  I've nothing left to give, and if I had the choice of flipping a switch, there's a very high chance I'd do it.  And I'm so scared of surviving an OD but fucking up my body.

I'm so worn of this dark and scary existence.  I  feel like I've nothing left to give, but life keeps coming at me, and I just want all the pain, fear, and sadness to go away.  When I was 17, in the depths of a suicidal depression, I made a promise to myself to just try one more day, you can end things if it doesn't work.  I've kept that promise for more than 15 years, and I'm just tired of fighting.

I'm sorry. I've tried therapy and meds, but I just don't know what I can do.

Vent ig?,I dont know. My heads pretty messed up lately. Im still in high school but actually moves schools in November 2023. My old school was a really good school but was far from my house. I was pretty popular there and it was fun to be there and just overall a great experience. I had made quite a few close and loyal friendships and life was good. This all changed when i moved schools. Now my new school is in Centrale London whereas the last one was Kent. two VERY different places. My new school is a state school. My old school was a grammar school. Now i moved because of the travelling issue as my dad had to drive one hour to get to school. Now to my new school i just take a train. Now one thing is that the school is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy smaller than my old school. it makes things feel cramped and congested all the time and i have nowhere to breathe. although the drugs/vapes/smoking/pollution in the air doesnt really help either. Just to say but my school is a whole year academically behind. Ive been TRYING to study hard but that is hard to do as ive gained a new sense of laziness. Ive been making no friends as everyone in the school is just toxic and i mean TOXIC. The downright play their own friends and insult them with no filter ofr apologie or even a 'im just kidding'. It just makes you feel like sh1t. Ive been constantly stomped on and made fun of by my cleassmates even though i do litterally nothing and try not to draw attention to myself and i envy the kids who arent brought to the topic of the conversations. People gossip about me at every corner and mix up my words on purpose to get something interesting. ive tried to make friends and it worked fine at first but then they kept on insulting me or saying im annoying or calling me weird. People try to get me in detention constantly even saying their name is my name so my name is put down for detention.

For the past 3-4 weeks, i have done nothing except for lay in bed the entire day, curtains closed, sleep, eat and rot and stare at my phone. Barely managed to shower, brush my teeth and brush my hair. Most days didn’t even change out of my sweatspants. Only left the house to buy food and go to therapy (at least that was still possible). But no one in my life gets it. I don’t even tell my parents because they get angry quickly and blame me for not getting off my ass. I tried opening up to someone from uni who asked why i wasn’t attending anymore. But when i told him i wasn’t feeling good and barely make it out of bed everyday he was like „lol why are YOU exhausted you don’t even come to class“ and i was like yeah no shit that’s the issue.

Looking for some advice,"I have always denoncouned any labels to myself. Personally I find it limiting 
Yet sometimes calling something for what it is doesn’t help identity it.

Recently watched the Bridgerton queen series with my partner 
And this triggered me to acknowledging that I go through episodes of such lows and such highs.

As a young boy, I was such an over thinker. Alone most of my life, found comfort in myself and lived a lot in my own head.
Fast forward to being in my twenty’s
To combat that way of life, I simply didn’t think about what I was doing.
I just did it, with no thought of reprocussion.
This lead me into a dark path

Over the last 3 years I have found ways to get out of that way of life.
I mediate, write, gym, pray.

Yet living more open to feelings and what courses through me can sometimes undermine me.

There’s always this underlying sense of…emptiness and sadness.

I know if I think too much now that really, it hurts me.

How do others go about this?

To live and enjoy, to consciously embrace and reflect yet engage in life in a matter of “doing”?
To avoid this dread that lingers me.

how can I change for the better? ,"TRIGGER WARNING: body image issues, suicidal ideation

22(f) I have been diagnosed with PTSD, Depression, and ADHD

I don't think I have ADHD just super obsessive thoughts about traumatic things that happened to me that distract me from daily tasks. 

I'm on Wellbutrin. I also smoke nicotine. I'm jobless. Never went to college. 

My day consists of eating and sleeping and mindlessly scrolling on social media. Brain rot. Laying down in bed. Eating more food, watching videos to ""change your life"" and ""becoming elevated."" 

This must be peak depression. I also just lost my job due to a manager harassing me, he fired me on the spot when I said he makes me uncomfortable. Probably because he was afraid of me telling his boss. There goes months of hard work to get that promotion. 

Also going through a break up of a 4 year long relationship after it got extremely toxic and I noticed myself feeling happier around friends. I felt more alone than ever while being with him. I started to despise him because I started feeling like his mother, everything he did  pissed me off. I don't think he's ever felt like that towards me. Which is why I felt guilty for leaving.

Got a new boyfriend without even processing the previous breakup. I then broke up with him over jokes he had made that made me feel way more insecure than I've ever felt.   
I still love this guy, I just hate myself for not being able to take a joke. He was quite literally too perfect for me, everything I had been looking for in a partner. I could not shake the thought that he's settling for me or I'm not his real type. Though he's never said that to my face, I can already tell by the way he interacts with other women- who even I - deem more attractive than me. Everything else about him was great, it's was those slick comments and small moments that stuck with me, confirming how ugly I am. 

I broke it off due to my self esteem being majorly low and that I'll only add depression into his life. He said I can depend on him, that he'd help, but I've been in this situation before. You do so much for someone to feel better, it's never gonna fulfill them until they love themselves. I'd only be searching for validation, I wouldn't be confident or secure. 

I'm having suicidal thoughts, everything I've done has lead to failure. I lost passion in my hobbies. I'm scared to start college at my age (22 about to be 23) I fear I'm too late.

I hate my body, it's the ugliest body I've ever seen. Who'd want to fuck this? Saggy tits, no ass, wrong proportions, fat, ugly face. No amount of surgery will help, nor do I have the money for it lmao. 

No one can love and accept my body except my ex of 4 years, but I dislike him. Do we see the hypocrisy here? 

Then I fell deeply into the topic of astrology, christianity, demons, God, creator of the universe, spirituality, crystals, witches, spell casting. I don't even know who or what to believe in anymore. Thus making me even more insecure and afraid. 

My friends (5 total) think I'm funny because of how dramatic I am. That's the only thing I have going for me is my outward performance to people will have a layer of humor and unseriousness.   
I started going to the gym and it helps, but some days it gets so bad I binge eat and don't move from my bed. I try to not eat so much, I can't help it. It's the only thing that comforts me right now. 

  
TLDR// My depression is getting the best of me and I overeat to feel better. Gaining weight. I started going to the gym, but I still eat like shit and don't even move at all sometimes. Any advice to build a routine that I can follow? I know everything I said can be labeled as ""excuses"" but it's so difficult for me to get out of this funk. Please help.

Work in healthcare. 
No friends (not a single one). 
Work in a relatively toxic environment (boss isn’t nicest person in the world, staff are equally as cliquey and regularly insult/make fun off people when they’re not on)

I can absolutely see myself being single until the literal day I die. Every single day off for me is spent alone, eating or sleeping. That’s literally it. My idea of a day out is going out myself to get food and that’s literally it. 

I’ve realized recently that not only am I very overweight, I’m also very ugly/unattractive. And this is absolutely not me feeling sorry for myself. I’ve a massive double chin, a round circle face, bumpy/slanty/weird nose, weird yellow uneven teeth etc. I could go on. 
At least when I was skinny I had that to hide my attractiveness, but now there’s absolutely no hiding it. 

I don’t get told about family gossip. I have my weight pointed out regularly. I have my lack of a social life pointed out regularly. I’ve only recently started getting praised at my job/told I’m doing well. That’s it. That’s the one and only thing I’ve got going for me. No friends. No boyfriend or girlfriend.

Passive suicide thoughts,"# Passive suicide thoughts

Is there anyone out there who struggles with passive suicide thoughts?

English is not my first language but I will try to explain the best that I can. This is not a post asking for sympathy, I'm simply looking for someone out there who struggles with the same thing and has overcome it/ found a way to excist without it taking over their life.

I'm a 25 year old girl, I have a boyfriend and own an apartment, and have a decent job. Still, I feel like my life has no meaning. I feel that life in general is meaningless, and this world is full of hurt, and I don't understand how I can keep on living. I think about dying every single day, yet I'm not strong enough to go through with it. I don't want to hurt the people around me who do not view the world the same way I do, but I can't stop thinking about the relief of simply not excisting anymore.

I feel that I have so much hatred inside of me and so much anger, both towards myself and humanity itself. People are so cruel, both to other people, to animals, and to the planet. I think the world would be a much better place without humans. And I feel so alone with these thougths, and almost like they're ""illegal"", because humans are viewed as on top of the pyramide.

I see now that this post is just a mess, but I really just need to know if there is anyone out there sharing these thoughts, because I feel so alone. I wish there was a ""stop""-button to life, and that I could be able to end it when I wanted without all the dramatics. That there would be a painless way to go, without doing something that hurts. These thoughts have taken over my life, and even though I'm not ""struggling"", because I am able to function in the day-to-day life, I don't understand how much longer I can keep going with this chaos inside my head.

SO is there anyone out there who has been struggling with this and has found something that helped? A way to find meaning in life or just rewire the brain to be happy again? Or are there any motivational speakers/therapists that are known for struggling with this, but has found a way to erase those thoughts? I hope this reaches someone who can maybe share some advice.

Thank you in advance.",ingrid1234567890,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2ll60/passive_suicide_thoughts/
Guilt of killing myself ,I would kill myself but I keep living for my dad . ,Charming_Cap_1088,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2vwhr/guilt_of_killing_myself/
"My real goal in life is killing myself, it ironically gives me energy ","I first became depressed at 12, and was first planning to kill myself on the day before my 13th birthday. The thoughts are never gone. They lessened in high school, but got much worse in university. My first attempt (and soon after, multiple) was eventually in university. I think that it's because I was in the wrong major (besides the inherent negatives in life that would always be there). 

I have graduated now, currently doing nothing at home. I want to study so I can apply and get into university again, thus escaping from home and can try killing myself again. But life is pointless, so why bother studying? I can run away into a hotel and kill myself there anyway. 

One day I realized that I really do want to die, I really want to kill myself, that dying is my life goal, and I accepted this. I finally felt peace again. I realized that I can use my wanted major as a publicly acceptable reason to go away again from home. Other people don't have to know that I'm actually escaping to kill myself. Suddenly I'm much more focused in my studying.

This better work. I must get into that university so I have the freedom to try to kill myself again. Or I can do hotel suicide anyway.

(Suicide is not the only reason for getting into university, there are also concerns with dream major and dream subject, but how this went wrong the first time partly caused my suicidality to get so much worse and I'm mostly hopeless now. If I get there, suicide. If I don't get there, suicide. If anybody hurts me, I remind myself that I'll soon escape and can kill myself there. But if I didn't die, going there is theoretically better than rotting at home surrounded by people who caused this thing in the first place.)",Level_Newspaper_8927,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4t5yw/my_real_goal_in_life_is_killing_myself_it/

Everything has fallen apart. ,"I've suffered from depression for about 15 years now. This year decided to finally get myself together, I became financially stable, found a relationship, made friends, worked on my self-care. 

This week everything fell apart, I had to cut contact with my family over personal issues, grew tired of being abused by my dad. My relationship fell apart with my ex it wasn't working out, I had a trip planned to AZ with my ex, received an email day we broke up it was cancelled by the airline. It was meant to be something special for my 30th birthday. I feel like im back to square one.  ",CableTies69,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4nve3/everything_has_fallen_apart/
Me (19F) and My Partner (20M) Almost Broke Up Over My Depression ,"My partner has been on vacation for two weeks and recently returned. When he was gone, I had a depressive episode (honestly, not my worst one, but still), and long story short, it led to us almost breaking up over the phone. His main reasoning was that he already ""deals"" with it with his mom, has had bad experiences in the past, and is going off that. Essentially just saying that having a depressive partner would be too ""difficult/hard"" for him to deal with, even though he hasn't made a huge attempt to cater to me personally. This is the first time he's seen me like this.

A lot happened in between, but I ended up basically saying that we aren't breaking up until we (he) try. But now, especially after summarizing it, Im wondering if I should've just let him leave. I'm wondering if, at the next difficult roadblock, he's just going to be like, ""This is too hard; I'm out."" I don't feel as secure as I used to, as sure of his love for me, and I'm worried about things progressing because I don't want to be a year in, having poured so much into the relationship, and he leaves because things get hard. 

Some context: His mother also has depression and is a lot more volatile with it than I am. Same with past girlfriends. About 3-4 days ago, she asked him to help kill herself. His trip has also been overstimulating (his words) and not as pleasant as he wanted. Yes, I'm in the process of getting help; I need money to pay for therapy and to see a psychiatrist, but that's my number one priority. I don't expect him to sacrifice everything to try and fix me, but as my partner, I do expect him to be there for me and ride out the storm with me. It's only been about 4 months, so I didn't expect him to know all my ins and outs, but I did expect him to stay and try, and if I hadn't stepped in, I feel he wouldn't have. 

I also want to note that he has been an absolutely amazing boyfriend prior to this (opens every door for me, pays for almost everything, always compliments me, good morning texts, the list goes on) so this really through me. It feels like we should just call it quits but I'm wondering if there's any possible alternative.

TLDR: Me and my boyfriend almost broke up because my depression is too much for him to ""deal"" with. ",Responsible-Bus7806,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2l2rx/me_19f_and_my_partner_20m_almost_broke_up_over_my/
I just don’t see a future with me in it ,"Almost 30 now and have been in the same spot in life for 10+ years now. Smoking my life away watching everything pass me by. This year I decided to try to get trauma therapy to address when I was sexually abused when I was little.. Needless to say it’s fucked my whole head up. Not only am I having the flashback dreams I been having for years, I am day-nightmaring vividly about the day I was raped. I have been out of work while I get this therapy and had to dip into Roth IRA to pay rent and bills &amp; this past time I ended up paying off this months rent and gambling the rest of the money away. — that’s another thing that hasn’t made anything easier. I like to make things more difficult for myself. I feel like I’m acting more irrational than ever before and don’t see value in staying alive to watch myself flounder

Vale realmente seguir intentándolo?,"Llevo años en este estado ,en dónde siento que no hago más que postergar el dolor , que vivir de efectos placebos que hacen que pueda digerir de alguna manera la vida. Me muestro tan fuerte y fría,pero por dentro soy tan sensible y me afecta mucho lo de mi alrededor. Ningún logro me hace sentir satisfecha, busco suplir ese vacío con pasatiempos, deporte y hobbies, que en el fondo no es más que mentirme a mi misma.Al final del día,solo siento que no encajo con nada ni nadie, siempre he sentido que no soy de este mundo, ni siento que mi cuerpo me identifica, me veo al espejo y no me siento yo, la dismorfia corporal me mata cada día,pero sigo con una sonrisa afrontando cada situación, sigo siendo la persona de contención para todos,sigo siendo dentro de mi,esa persona que aún busca sentirse a gusto y tiene esperanza. No pueden decir que no lo he intentado, he ido a terapia por años ,he sido medicada, me mantengo activa ,por sobre todo,me mantengo ocupada para no pensar.No me apetece compartir , he perdido muchas amistades y siento que en el fondo ,no me importa,que por alguna razón,no están. Siempre doy mi más sincero amor y cariño, y les juro que jamás espero tanto de vuelta.En parte morí cuando mi mascota murió hace unos años, no volví a ser yo, se llevó mi vida, y cada día me arrepiento de no haber estado ahí, cada día siento que me hace tanta falta.Me siento sola,pero lo peor es que cuento con personas cercanas y a pesar de eso,siento que nadie me comprende,que en cambio, me hacen sentir una persona complicada, alguien mal agradecido, con mal carácter. Siento que me estoy perdiendo nuevamente, siento que estoy apagandome cada vez más.Lamento tanto no poder mejorar , siento que hay algo mal conmigo, que siempre llego a esta instancia, en dónde no puedo amar bien, no puedo ser una buena hija, nieta, hermana o novia.Finalmente siempre hago daño, indirectamente, siempre lo arruino.",apathetik_k,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3l5r5/vale_realmente_seguir_intentándolo/
Writing letters,"This is my first and maybe only post here. I'm 34/M. I've been suicidally depressed for many years, but ultimately have admitted to myself that I'll likely never drum up the blistering level of courage it takes to actually follow through. This, ironically, depresses me more than anything. I feel trapped here, unfulfilled and hopeless, because I lack the balls to put a gun to my temple and pull the trigger. 

I spend a lot of time reading and listening to material on suicide, its ethics, testimonials from those affected by it. It's a morbid form of research, but my hope is that I'll eventually find a way to be unafraid, or brave enough in the face of fear to commit. To me, the greatest possible tragedy is continuing on through the length of my natural life, always sad, angry, resentful.

So far, I'm too afraid to buy a gun or the necessary chemicals. But I always knew that if I ever committed, I wouldn't just leave a note. I'd write a small handful of individual letters to my friends and family, apologizing, telling them I love them, trying to explain. I decided to write those letters tonight, and I feel good about it. Like I'm finally doing something. It'll take hours and I'll cry a lot during it, but it's a step that I can take.

Please don't have children. It creates meaning in one's life the way a pyramid scheme creates profit for its owners. You are merely shifting the burden of meaninglessness onto an innocent child.

I fantasise about suicide daily, but I know that when it comes down to it I will stop myself. I know that if I do not work to build a good life, I will live a long painful life spending everyday wishing to die.

I need to vent,"I (15M) just need to vent I'm sorry for wasting your time.

  
I can barely get in the courage to text my friends I ghost them because I feel like they don't care and I know I'm a bad friend for doing this I try not to but my anxiety is too much. I've done so many bad things to my body and my self worth is just so shattered. Last year in September I told my parents I am aromantic (one who does not experience romantic attraction) and they kinda brushed it off. I set a note on their nightstand loosely explaining stuff. The next day, my mom just told me ""that's a cool thing to learn about yourself"" and my dad asked if I wanted to tell anyone and that ""you may not want a romantic relationship, but later in life you'll desire companionship"". They never asked any more questions. It has been 10 stupid fucking months. I don't have the strength to tell them I'm asexual, bi, and want to identify as gender neutral. They brushed it off and I fucking hate it. My dad also thought it was funny one time to call trans people ""transformers"" when talking about a law our state passed. In front of my grandparents. I don't even care anymore about wanting to identify as gender neutral I'll just suppress it for a while

They also brushed off my voice, which for almost 2 years has been pitched around an E#4-C5 (it changes based on my mood/volume I'm trying to reach) and I can't raise my voice's volume or deepen my pitch (though I can hit some sick notes like the highest note of Cemetery Gates by Pantera, which is an A5). At all. I think I have a thing called puberphonia (look it up) and I can't even really talk if there are more than 5 people talking in a classroom. I asked them if I could go to a doctor and my mom got angry and told me ""do you want me to take you to a speech therapist""? No, not anymore, because you are fucking angry and you truly don't care. That was last December. They are going to talk to my doctor about it at my next checkup, they said. They said that a month ago. My next checkup is in like 2 weeks. They don't even care enough to get me help, they just wait it out. They don't know what it's like to learn sign language and before bed wish your voice just stops when you wake up. Fucking dumbasses.

I got h.arassed for over 20 minutes in front of my 8th period class in May by multiple people and they made fun of my identity and my voice and I felt really shitty I did some bad things that night. Nobody helped me. I didn't break down there at least. At night I broke down bad and did some bad things to my body.

Reached out and got berated.,"I reached out to cousin again for help and he berate me. And they say why we don't speak up. Shit
This ain't the first time. When I don't open up they say don't be a hero. When I open up they're gonna talk down to me. 
I was slowly improving, baby steps. Now I don't feel hopeful anymore. This is the reason why people don't reach out.

People just stopped seeing you as a fellow human being 
I could use some hospitalizations now anyway. Fine. 

I said maybe we could play table tennis together which he said okay. Then he started berated me when I say need Non-judgmental support. You aren't allowed to ask for help nor are you allowed to act as if everything is okay. I think it's an ego thing. 

The last time I got berated was when I have scabies. 2 years ago. I had it for a year before I manage to keep it in control. Even my mother scolded me when I ask for help. I couldn't sleep. I get itchy when it's warm. My mom to this day don't believe I have scabies even after I confirmed my diagnosis with a dermatologist. She cursed me. Sigh 

It's been a year since I recovered. Why everyone thinks they are allowed to bully me. I'm tired

I think a concussion ignited my depression ,"11 years ago I suffered a mild concussion from a skiing accident off a small jump at the age of 16. The accident itself wasn’t anything major, but I felt a sharp jolt to my head. Thinking it was just whiplash, I continued skiing well into the evening. The off feeling persisted, but didn’t think it could be a concussion since it was such a small fall. It also didn’t help my poles were stolen and thrown off the chairlift. The next day when I got into work I felt dizzy and even briefly forgot how to talk. I was diagnosed with a concussion on the spot and driven home.

For more context, I grew up with an extreme case of Dyslexia and mild ADHD in a household where there was a lot of arguing. I was no stranger to deep feelings of alienation and sadness. These feeling were never life threatening as I was always looking to the future. The months leading up to my concussion was a real sea change in my life, I developed a strong friend group, got my best report cards ever, made honor roll, became a accomplished student athlete breaking a school record and was league MVP. My parents weren’t arguing as much and they were expressing how proud of me they were. For the first time since I was a child I truly felt happy and optimistic. To top it off I met and began talking to the girl who would become my first real girlfriend and now my fiancé. I remember simple things like riding the subway or walking home from school and amazed at how great and full of color life was feeling. I felt truly comfortable in my skin.

Then I got concussed. Luckily enough it was at the start of February break so it was easier to lie in bed and relax. I missed the next week of school and when I stepped back into the world, everything felt different. The feeling of life being full of color was gone. It was like a reverse Wizard of Oz going from color to black and white. Truthfully things started to feel gray and I no longer felt comfortable in my skin.

Then my friend group was falling apart and constantly poking fun at me. My Dad’s company was in dire straits, my Mom had some of her own health problems which resulted in her violently lashing out. It also didn’t help this was the latter half of Jr Year when SATs and the start of college applications. 

A couple times I remember feeling so overwhelmed that I collapsed on the floor. For the first time, I felt truly depressed and didn’t know how to communicate how was truly feeling. When I tried to explain to my parents or friends how my brain was feeling and I was experiencing persistent headaches, they downplayed it saying I ‘get over it’ and that I only had a mild concussion. Even the doctors said I was fine, but I was too afraid to tell anyone just how badly I was struggling and the dark places my brain was going. 

It felt as if all hope had been sucked out of me. I used to wake up and excited to take on the day, now I was waking up and dreading the day ahead. I began having a more difficult time focusing on schoolwork and I totally bombed the SATs. The one saving grace was I was now in a very committed and loving relationship.

When I think back to my senior year of high school, all I am reminded of is feeling deeply depressed and always trying to hide it. All throughout college I was depressed, battled suicidal ideation and even took a semester off because I had a depressive episode. My senior year, my parents warmed up to my depression, it was easier to talk about and they were more supportive. My depression was at its worst the summer after my college graduation. Since college, each year has gotten progressively better and better. I went back into therapy and two years ago began taking antidepressants. Now I almost feel I have crawled out of a a depressive hole and gained my optimism back. 

Still I can’t help but notice the fact that it was that’s concussion 11 years ago when I truly started feeling depressed. I always blamed my depression on what was going on around me and the fact it runs in my family, but it was that concussion when I first felt my brain change and depression sink in. It’s almost as if I’m finally feeling I’ve recorded from the concussion. Would life have gotten harder due to the events that happened to those around me, yes but I feel my concussion made it worse. For the first time since I was 16, I’ve gone months without thoughts of suicide and is the least depressed I’ve felt since before the concussion. Still I can’t help but feel an aching sadness that maybe I wouldn’t have experienced this over decade long depression if I decided not to hit that small jump.

Do I deserve this?,"It's been 6 weeks since I lost all motivation to get out of bed, to go out, to go to work, and do other stuffs that I love before. I just realized that no matter how genuine and sincere you can be to others, there will still be unexpected people in your life that would only want to keep you just for their convenience and would only use you for their own selfish goals. After they got what they needed, you're just like some trash that didn't exist. This really hurts the most especially if the person you didn't expect was the one whom you poured your heart the most.

Not only was my heart and my trust broken but also my hope for love. It's always been this kind of situation since college, which was 9 years ago. But the pain that I'm feeling now is the worst pain I ever felt in my whole life. I can't sleep for more than 2 hours just because of having so many WHY'S in my head even though I take sleeping pills. Like I just want to swallow all of it in 1 take just to see if I can get the peaceful sleep I want and hope to never wake up again. Because I can't seem to understand why I always wind up in this situation.

The girl one day randomly came to our house and left everyone speechless she knew everyone's secret. And my family found out something too he used to lie to her saying that dad kept him like a prisoner or we forsed him to drink toilet ok water. She bought my brother many expensive gifts like a apple watch. She would send perfumes, clothes, shampoo, expensive watches etc.l just cleared the 9 grade and was given some holiday but my mom could not stand it. She asked my brothers many times to beat me for playing then she would say l didn't mean for this to happen. I feel ones my father dies my brothers will take over the company and leave me nothing.

I'm happy it will all be over soon,"There's relief in knowing you won't be in pain anymore and will be dead soon. It's so simple and easy. You're given an option to either move forward, but moving forward requires energy and a lot of effort and to do that you must suffer a lot. That is not a real choice, you're only being given the option to suffer immense pain or die. So dying it is because I have no energy left for anything else. At least my last days will be somewhat more peaceful and spent more happier knowing it will all pass away and my misery and suffering will end.

I might have ruined my relationship with my depressed gf,"
I (22M) have been dating this wonderful girl (23F) for 8 months now. I love her very much, she has everything I could ask for in a girlfriend. However, our relationship hasn't been easy as we both suffer from poor mental health. She has officially diagnosed depression which makes her operate on low energy and often delve into anxious thoughts. She's also a college student, so even though she receives treatment, her health has really nosedived this semester.

Throughout our relationship, she would frequently comment on her feeling inadequate. Phrases like 'I'm fat', or 'I'm stupid', or 'I'm lazy', or 'I don't do well at school'. Every time I would either comfort her and say she's perfect the way she is or try and encourage her to see the situation from a different perspective. For example, I would say, 'Look at what you have achieved on medication and low energy! You have a  severe mental condition, and yet other people perceive you as a sort of a genius. That's something to be EXTREMELY proud of!'

However, I have my own issues. For the past 8 months (what a coincidence) I've been helping my family take care of my nana who suffers from dementia. We're too poor to afford a nursing home and mother and father are severely unprepared to care for a terminally ill person. We have bickered, argued, our family has basically fallen apart. This has taken a toll on my mental health.

My gf's state has also got worse. She began crying and feeling inadequate more frequently. She would tell me how she wasn't proud of herself and how she wished she died. And in my poor mental state, instead of encouraging her, I became harsh and abrasive. We bickered about small things and would often have difficult conversations about the relationship and our issues. I would get extremely arrogant and all but outright state how much I had helped her when she needed help. She would also get anxious thoughts and doubts about both our relationship and my intentions with her.

She went on a family vacation in early July. We had several more difficult convos, and then she decided to reduce contact with me. She said it wasn't a break and that she still wanted a relationship, it's just that she needed to recharge and recuperate. We've only been briefly updating each other on how our day went since. She will come back on July 27 and then we'll get to talk about everything. 

Had I had better control over my state, I would've handled hers. And now, I fear, I might have damaged the relationship irreversibly. 

TL;DR: 
Have a wonderful relationship with a great girl. She suffers from depression. I used to be able to calm her anxious thoughts down, but as my mental health deteriorated, I became more irritable and arrogant. I'm afraid by this I've done irreversible damage to the relationship.",Dwolfix,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4sbah/i_might_have_ruined_my_relationship_with_my/

there is no way it can get better,"what the title says. i don't have the energy to type this in an organized way, sorry. i'm 21nb in the US trying to finish college. i'm also autistic (diagnosed) and i've never been able to hold a job for longer than 3 months or so due to my disability. college is indescribably hard for me at this point, and why am i even getting a degree i won't be able to use. i have severe PTSD from being raped/abused for nearly a year when i was underage and it still affects me every day. i assume i have pretty bad substance abuse issues because i can't go a day without drinking or smoking to cope with this shit life. i just realized i was craving a beer while writing this and then saw it's only 10am on a tuesday which made me feel like such a fucking failure. i'm only close with one side of my family and they're all either already dead, or dying of medical conditions. we are poor, can't afford a house, barely affording medical care even with lots of medicaid coverage. i have enough savings to stay at my apartment for a little while longer, but when they run out i truly have no idea what i'm going to do (can't work and don't qualify for SSI). the income needed to live sustainably in my area is over $30/hr--i have never made that much money in my life nor am i set up on a trajectory to do so. i've already been homeless when i was 18 and i'd rather kill myself than do that again. i have a partner whom i love very much but they are in the same boat as me in many of these aspects, sometimes it feels like we just exacerbate each others' problems. 

most of my day to day life involves skipping class to drink at the public park or go read at a bar. reading books is probably the only thing i do regularly that brings me any joy. i don't know how much longer i can hang on like this, especially considering things are going to get much worse in the near future. growing up i was always a star kid, good grades, plenty of ""future prospects,"" super friendly, etc. now i'm essentially just an unhealthy hermit who wants to die. 

i don't understand people who praise my country for being an amazing place to live in. i tried to do everything ""right""--save money, graduate high school, attend college (i even got a full ride but lost it last year), maintain a good network of family and friends. knowing that i already tried my best and my future prospects include being homeless and not being able to afford to eat is not doing wonders for my already fucked head",anomarex,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e4q2qp/there_is_no_way_it_can_get_better/

Shouldn’t be here,"I shouldn’t have been born, and then be allowed to live for this long and take up space. Everyday I feel like a ghost among the living, I honestly can’t believe I’m in real life and not some purgatory. Well, maybe I am and I just don’t realize it.

At this point I don’t feel anything. My voice is giving out, my eyes are hollow and unsettling to look at. I can’t make any facial expressions, I have extreme blunt affect. I feel like a freak show whenever I try to blend in with others because, it’s always an uphill battle to put on the mask, and I never get it right. Everyday I feel inhuman, like some fucking alien. I feel retarded for having these problems, and it feels like nothing, but I can’t take feeling like I’m not of this earth every day. It makes me want to leave.

My upbringing fed into my dissociation and inability to connect with others. I never stayed in the same place for more than a year, never had a stable home. Honestly, I’ve never connected with anyone in my life, and frankly I don’t know how and if I ever will. 

So yeah, I feel like some walking flesh bag that can form thoughts, but not fully human. I’ve lost all of my interests and I don’t give a fuck anymore, it means nothing to me. The thing is, I still can’t fucking kill myself because I have a parent who’s depending on me. They’re the only person I have in my life. Once they go, I don’t see a reason to stay. It’ll be hard to keep going though, and I wish I could just be erased from existence. I don’t want to actually kill my self, maybe because I’ve always been a coward.

Ill explain, i had an extremely sad and rough life which has caused me trauma and personality disorders such as bpd. I was s3xually abus3d as a child (cocsa) and as a teenager by older teenagers. This led to several identity issues for me with my sexuality. i became fixated on sex by age 6, which only made my situation worse as i would try to have sex with people and the only people who would have me were pdf files.  I became exposed to pdf files and pdf file p0rn by some of my abusers by age 13. my mouth was r4ped at that age and i developed an oral fixation. I became addicted to smoking cigarettes and marijuana, also took a bunch of drugs and acohol during my teenage years, as one does, and i developed an addiction to benzos. i started to sell pics of myself to pay for my addiction. This benzo addiction kept going until i was 18 and my family sent me to rehab. I recovered and had to be put on medication for my issues. abilify and prozac, i take them to this day. I also had an ED during my adolescence and self harm issues. I am now recovered but i ache greatly as i want to feel how i felt before, i felt alive. I have gained like 40 kgs since my ed and i wish i could go back to how my body was since i no longer find myself cute or fuckable. i dont go outside anymore, i dont have “friends“ to “hang out with”, i have a psychiatrist and psychologist but nobody else to talk to. I only stay at home and play online (Dont have online friends either). I am extremely unbearable in relationships so nobody will put up with me, i am also ugly so its hard enough. should i just off myself as i am clearly in for a long life of suffering? My memory will not cease and i cannot forget how good having friends and taking drugs felt, or how greatly being loved by someone feels like. i still havent finished school yet because im a loser who failed chemestry and its been years since. should i just kms?

I don't have it in me to answer people. ,"First post here hope it's ok.. 
I'm on summer vacation and I've basically been ghosting everyone since July started pretty much, most people didn't even notice, but the people who did text me (like 1 person I'd say) I just do not have it in me.

I just ruined my future.,"I'm 17F. I used to cut a lot before I got caught. I have a ton of scars on one of my thighs. I was supposed to enter the military. But I learned that the military will never trust me to do important, well paying jobs even with a waiver. If they even let me in in the first place since people say it's a coin flip if they decide your good enough even with a self-harm waiver, getting a psych evaluation, and lying about being suicidal . 



My original depression was from a severe vitamin D deficiency. I felt numb and disgusting all the time with a heavy feeling in my heart. I cut to cope with something I didn't understand. I didn't know why I was depressed. After getting a prescription for Vitamin D, I stopped feeling depressed and forced myself to stop cutting even though it was a horrific addiction.



I have to go tell my parents, and they will be supportive of explaining why I can't enter the military. But it's so humiliating. I wanna fucking die. They were both in both the Amy and marines and said that the benefits of specifically the air force will lead me to a better life. But I ruined it. Because I cut. 



I feel numb again. My heart feels heavy and hurt. Breathing is hard with how tight my chest feels. I wanna cut so badly. 



I have options and my parents are 100% supportive. But the military was my best shot at thriving. And I ruined it. I ruined my chance at a cheaper college experience, free Healthcare, and respect for myself. I wanna go back and change the first ever cut I made. But I can't.

How do I stop feeling guilty about the things I don't do?,"I know this might be a symptom of depression and I know I can't possibly do everything. I also know that some of these things I should do, but life for me is a constant stream of things I don't want to do. Having to do them anyway. Getting exhausted and then neglecting things I should do. I'm a single man 32, I work full time in tech support. I have family and friends that want to see me, but I don't really want to see them. When I am with other people I experience a constant pain that I can't describe. Maybe this is what people call anxiety? I feel pain when people talk to me. I feel constant guilt over saying the wrong things or being awkward. It's like they don't give me the feedback I need to feel at ease. There's a constant needling and sarcasm, and I just don't feel rapport with anyone. It's like I'm not on anybody else's wavelength. I used to feel connected to people, but not anymore. I feel like I'm wasting my life away. I've tried so hard putting myself out there, but all it leads to is more things I don't want to do and environments I don't want to be in. I quit teaching because of it. Before that I quit university. I quit sports. I quit hobbies. I quit clubs. I've quit friendships. I've quit everything and just decided that getting my work life to function is my top priority. But I feel constant guilt that I'm not playing sports, not dating, not decorating my apartment, not practicing guitar or chess, not eating healthy, not cooking enough for myself. Some people make me feel guilty. My father points out the things I don't do when he's over. And he's right, it's not normal, but I don't know how to get there. My brother critizices everyone for everything, but he still hurts me when he points out what I don't do.

Of course I concider suicide, but it's obviously not what I want. It comes from not living up to what I think society wants from me. Don't spam me with the suicide hotline stuff. I don't live in the US.

I've tried therapy, but I can't navigate that system. I can't afford private help and I don't know how to fit it into a schedule. Nobody else at my work takes time off for frequent appointments. When I've gotten ""help"" it's mostly been a shitshow of wrong diagnoses, being tossed around the system, talking to people with no empathy or sympathy for my situation, being coerced into taking antipsychotics, only for the professionals to change their minds about what is actually wrong. At this point I have a diagnosis of avoidant personality disorder with schizoid tendencies, which might be correct.

Right now I have 3 weeks off work. Just sitting in my apartment feeling guilty about not doing anything. People think it's weird I don't have plans and is not going traveling. It's my birthday in a week and I have nothing planned. I never have had plans for my birthday since I was a child. I don't actually have any friends where I live.

I want to kill myself because I can’t draw.,"Hi friends. I know how stupid it sounds, but the title pretty much sums it up. I apologize that this also kind of gets a bit ramble-y. My mind is really racing atm. But thank you so much for even just deciding to read any of it, being noticed really means a lot. I will do my best to monitor this post and reply to anyone, but this is a throwaway account so bear with me if im slow.

I’m a 17 year old female surrounded by a friend group full of talented artists. For years I have struggled with this feeling of worthlessness because I lack any real talents. Everything in my life seems to revolve around art, and it kills me that im incapable of creating anything im proud of. My friends and I are sort of nerdy and really enjoy making characters and plots and stories together… but it pains me so much that I cannot put what is in my imagination onto paper or tablet. All of my friends get so much joy out of spending time drawing, and I just wish I had that. I am constantly whining and complaining about how bored I am and how much I wish I had a hobby. I have been doodling from time to time since such a young age and even after all these years I have never gotten better. “Practice makes perfect” is one of the biggest lies I have ever heard. Some people just have a natural talent. Yes, practice is important… but it just doesn’t help if you don’t have the initial spark. I’ve tried so hard, I really really have, but any time I try to bring myself to try again, all I want to do is break down crying. All I can do is compare myself to my friends. I know how dumb it is, but I am genuinely considering killing myself just because I have no artistic talent.. it’s all I’ve ever wanted in life and it’s simply not doable. All I want is to be able to fill my mundane life with something that makes me happy. Something that brings me even the smallest bit of joy. But I can’t. I’m simply not good enough, and never will be. I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to keep living so miserably. This is maybe the closest I have ever been to ending it once and for all. I have never previously attempted, but have had police show up at my house to do a welfare check in the past. I wasn’t necessarily planning anything, but I was definitely in a rough mindset. Im just too afraid to really try, and don’t want to hurt my friends and family, as well as my boyfriend (who also heavily struggles with mental health) because he has told me so many times that he would kill himself if he ever lost me to suicide. I don’t want to rip two families to shreds just because of me…

TL;DR: Surrounded by people more talented than me, constantly brought down by my lack of talent. All I’ve ever wanted is to be able to draw, but im simply not good enough for it. I just want to be able to do something that will make me happy because my life is so mundane feeling.

I am lost guys,"I have vitnessed violance in childhood, grew up without a father and a proper friendgroup. All my life I was on the weirder side of people. Never once there was a moment I didnt feel lonely and melancholic. Even when I have a good time, I realize I will miss that moment that happens very rarely and it breaks me. This last year was especially bad as I started realizing how unambitious and purposeless I really am. 2 months ago my GF of 1.5 years dumped me, and it was already the worst period of my life before that. I got over it but as I started anti-depressants a while back, I got too lazy and now I can't even clean my apartment. I failed most my lectures too. Today I got fired from a job I got in yesterday and cant even talk about it to someone. Whenever I think I have friends I realize I am the only one keeping the conversations, not once I am called or asked how I am. I stopped keeping those conversations lately, out of respect for myself. But I just don't know how to fix this. Surviving a day, passing the time, leaving the bed is just torture. I don't have suicidal thoughts, but I would rather not be born. I am pennyless, jobless, friendless and joyless. Nothing entertains me and nothing tries to anyways. I try to put a smile in my face no matter what, and I think I am kinder than most. But sometimes it just feels too difficult to keep it going. I wanna drop the meds due to sideeffects but I also don't know if I can do it without them. Wherever I look at life, I feel as if I am unlucky in almost all parts of it. My looks, place I live, friends I get... None of them seems to be in my favor.

It keeps getting worse and im the only one to blame,"This is dumb and stupid but I don’t care. I am so tired and i need to vent

I (16m) have had a shitty life. I know others had it worse. I know i am probably so lucky. I know i should suck it up and deal with it and actually get a life but im sick of this. Im sick.  
My whole life was basically spent on the internet. It raised me. It ruined and saved me. I wish my parents broke my electronics when i was younger and never looked back. Or maybe i just wish they were better parents. I wish they actually loved me.

they might say they do, but they don’t. My mom is controlling, strict, annoying and so, so mean to me. She fills me up with sweet nothings then she breaks me down to my core. My dad is basically not there. He’s present but not really. He’s distant emotionally and im terrified of him. He used to beat me and my siblings and he says he feels bad, he regrets it but he doesn’t. I don’t forgive him. If he truly felt bad he would make up for it but he doesn’t. He works all day long and is so tired all the time and i just don’t know. I will never forget that day where he yelled at me and my brother, basically threatened to kill him because he was trans, “if the government doesn’t kill you, i will” he said. He threw things and made me, my brother and my mother cry. He put his hand in my brothers private part and told him he had female genitalia so he was female. He said “and don’t you dare say you have trauma because of that.” I hugged my mom and told her that i was so sorry. She should be sorry. She did nothing to stop him. She is his accomplice. If they found out anything about me, that im trans or bi, they would ruin our lives. They have done it before. That I’m autistic, “you can’t have autism because you’re smart and autism is a disability and you dont have a disability. You can’t be autistic because you can function.” Was basically what my mom told me. I live on eggshells because they are around.

i have struggled mentally for basically my entire life. I have so many toxic tendencies, I struggle to stay alive every single day. I don’t know how much longer i can do this. But my siblings, i can’t leave them but i want to.  
i have no future. I’m lazy i really am, i like to draw but i can never seem to be able to open up the drawing App. I like to write but i can’t seem to actually bother. I want to start commissions but nothing is working, i’m so useless and worthless. Everything i’ve ever touched gets ruined. I’m a bad omen.

so i left all my friends, and my partner. Like i said, my whole life was spent on the internet. So obviously, i have had many online friends over the years. I met my best friend on the internet. All my relationships were on the internet. Almost everything that mattered was and is on the internet. when i was 14, i met this boy, and fell in love. I was ruined, and he broke me. Almost a year of my life was wasted on him. Then when i left him, he called me the n-slur (classy) then said it was because he was having a bad day afterwards. When i blocked him, he sent his friend to talk to me, tell me he was suffering and that he attempted and was acting shitty in school just so i can pity him and go back to him. But I didn’t. I know it was just some dumb teenage relationship but i was genuinely never the same afterwards. I still sent him one last message giving him advice and his friend said he got better. I blocked him a while after, too. I‘m glad i helped when nobody helped me. Well, they tried. I guess i really am selfish and stubborn, what ugly personality traits. Afterwards, i met them. I wish i could say when i did, it was perfect and i was happy. But i wasn’t. I self-harmed again, for the first time after dating that boy. I had my first panic attacks. I so desperately didn’t want to experience what i did with that boy, i guess. I confessed and we started dating. I loved them truly, i still do. I still love them. But i was rarely truly happy. Maybe if i was more open, but I refused to open up. I lied and lied and lied. I never felt so fake in my life. I self-harmed the most in that period. One hour i’ll be feeling an all-time high with them, the other they say one thing that upsets me and i fully shut down. I’ve never cried this much except with that boy. I would ignore them for hours, days, because i could not text them after being upset and I couldn’t open up. I know its my fault and i fucked im and i feel bad. Sometimes being with them felt like my heart was genuinely burning in my chest, not in the good way. I truly don’t know how to explain how it feels. I almost attempted suicide. I’ll never forget the true happiness i felt when I convinced myself i’d go through with it. a relief that cannot be explained. I’ll never forget my 16th birthday. It was such, such a good day. But then it progressively got worse. I sent my ex partner a drawing my brother drew for me. “He looks like he lives in his mothers basement.” It was meant as a joke, i know. But it hurt. “That’s so mean!” “How is it mean?” “ykw forget it” I spent that night crying on the floor and i selfharmed. I do not know what‘s wrong with me. I just felt like they didn’t care, just like he never did. I don’t know. I truly don’t understand either.  
so i left everyone, all my online friends, my partner. My best friend. I miss my best friend. My rock, my light, my life. My atlantis, as they said. my true family. My support system, the one who was always there.  
i just couldn’t do it anymore. It was for the better, they would all be better off without me.  
im ill, and broken, and a bad person, ugly and stupid, and truly, no one truly would want me. They say they do but i know better. They are better off without me.  
it hasn’t even been that long since i left and im so fucking done with everything. I feel so empty. I don’t even know, i feel nothing and everything at the same time. I still feel like im living 2 lives. One in my head, in the internet. The other with my family, the real world.  
Sometimes i regret leaving and sometimes im glad. All the times i wish i was dead.  
I don’t even cry anymore. I just cannot feel enough to cry. Like I genuinely can’t, i tried, but i cannot. Every single day i wish i was dead. I have no future in life. I want to study abroad, in canada or something, but my mother truly does not believe in me. I do not believe in myself. I have no money and it’s illegal for minors to work where i live. I’ll try to do well in school in the future but im not so sure. A scholarship is not very easy to get. I don’t want to stay here, i want to leave. I can’t stand it here anymore.  
for everyday of my life, i am trying. For every person, i tried to be the sunshine and make them happy. Let them lean on me i tried to be their light. I loved it and i was happy but i need that too. Everyday, slowly that light in me dwindled. Im scared it does not exist anymore, im scared i’ll never reach that kind, happy, cheerful, go-lucky girly person again. Im broken and a mess. And this is pathetic I know. Im pathetic. Maybe its my fault, i never really allowed myself to be vulnerable. I remember letting my siblings cry in my arms but i never cried in theirs. But im the oldest after all, i guess it only makes sense. Im supposed to be strong. Im trying. I wish i could muster to take pills and leave them. They are my only reason for staying. I have given up on everyone, i have no one in my life. Maybe i’ll do it when they don’t need me anymore.

I’m depressed because I ruined my life ,"Growing up, my childhood was trash. My family was trash. There are a lot of scars from alot of damage and trauma. Things I remember that I shouldn’t. Wish I didn’t. Memories of bad things. Those things have followed me into adulthood but I strive to be better. I raised my daughter away from my family so she didn’t grow up normalizing the behavior. I pretend like it doesn’t affect me but it does and yet I still try to put in a brave face. I still pretend like I’m a good mom. A good person. A good wife. But I have just proven that I am not. Fuck even typing this out sucks. I have never felt genuine love. Just from my kid. But never anyone else. Never from the people I want to feel it from. Never from the people that I love the most. I just never feel it. I never see it. I never believe it. Day in day out I beg and beg for it. I just want to know I’m loved. My husband works hard for our family. He’s the best there is. But I didn’t feel the love from him. I told him time and time again. My depression was bad and getting worse. I was trying meds and on and off counseling. But nothing was helping and I fell deeper and deeper. I had a weak moment and I latched onto attention I felt from another male. I thought holy shit someone actually showing me they like me? Someone actually having conversations with me? Someone who understands the depression and anxiety I am dealing with? I fell for it. And I fucked up. And that one mistake has flipped my families life upside down. I destroyed the man who loves me. My kid has to see her parents cry every single day. What the hell have I done? I just want to disappear. I wanting to stop hurting. I want to stop hurting people. How do I heal the hearts of the people I love.

It's so over.,"I am ugly, worthless, stupid, and don't deserve anything. I am a 14 year old girl, and I know the people who care enough to reply will be all like ""no, you have your whole life ahead of you"" well guess what, I don't have enough patience for that. My parents are so mean to me and make fun of my eating disorder. They call me fat, crazy hurtful nicknames, they are extremely strict, they call me ugly, and get mad at my grades despite me working so hard (I got 90's in all my grade 9 subjects but my mom hit me for it). I have one sibling who is my older brother, and he is no better, heck, even worse. My entire family hates me so much, and I'm clearly not the favorite child. My mom keeps coddling my older brother whenever he eats in front of me to make me feel bad and to make me ""eat more"" because she hopes I get jealous when seeing it. But every time I ate out of sadness because my mom loved him more, nobody cared. I didn't get the same treatment. I got treated worse and got called fat. I hope my anorexia eventually takes me with it. Nobody will even notice if I disappear. WHO will care for an ugly, unloved, friendless, insecure, shy girl like me. I hate myself, I hate my parents, I hate everyone,  hate the world, I wish God can just take me away from this ""test"". No matter what I do, it always ends in people gossiping about me in school, my parents insulting me, my brother laughing at me, and my self-esteem skyrocketing downhill. I'm just posting this as a rant and I'm sorry if it seems annoying but I hope there's someone out there I can relate to so I know I'm not alone, which would mean I am not worthless.

Simply feel weak and pathetic,"Physically.. And probably mentally.. I am weak, its hard for me to get out of old habits..like skipping school, smoking weed.. Not doing the right things, but not necessarily bad things, just things that wont you anywhere. I know i am weak, what i didnt know until recently was that well, i am pathetic. I was smoking with a good friend of mine around 4 months ago, now usually i dont ask these kinds of things or bring it up because its hard for me to express myself, like REALLY hard.. Even to parents, sister, brother.. Doesn't matter i just cant bring myself to burden other people with my problems (even though it would probably help a ton just to express a bit) but i asked my friend

 ""what do you really think about me?""
Friend: ""what do you mean?""
Me: ""when you look at me, what do you think?""
Friend: ""honestly, you're pretty pathetic..""

Damn.. That hurt but.. Its true, and the truth hurts. He said i am pathetic for the same reasons i mentioned. Skipping class, smoking too much, not focused on the right things. At that time i was really sad. And i still am, but now i realize it in its fullest.

I am weak, and i am pathetic.. There is jus nothing else to it
Im a bitch.. Simple as that.. I get scared easily (though i try not to show it) by things like loud sounds, or seeing a group of people walk by (i have been jumped before by around 7 to 8 people, so you can imagine how i feel)
I got set up and robbed by my own ""friends"".. Ouch, bye bye brand new shoes and puffer. I told my mom, and she told me how she worked so hard for those.. Not too long after, i heard her crying.. Im just so weak.. I really am a loser, no doubt about it.. There was times in school (when i actually went) that i would try to fit in, but i always got clowned on.. Or just got told im corny, not funny.. Ect. 
I have a few friends as of right now including the one i asked, he wouldn't say it to me.. But he knows, and the other know what i am.. They know i am a bitch, but they wouldn't say it.. I cry easily as well, im very emotional. It doesn't take a lot for me to cry on the inside, act like everything is ok.. Then go home and cry, USUALLY. As of right now though, i a unable to cry.. Even if i try my hardest i just cant. I think i am numb. 
A numb, weak, pathetic bitch. My living situation at home isnt bad, i have a nice mom and dad.. A brother and sister as mentioned.. They care for me, and i care for them too. I have too much patience with people, even if sometimes my friends act like dicks.. I never even really bring it up.. Because i know what they could hit me with is ""and what could you do about it?"" 
Nothing.. Nothing at all.. So i just stay quiet..
I am also pretty lonely, my 1st relationship was the worst expereince ever, got used.. She admitted she used me to get over her ex, it only lastes 1 month and a few weeks but it felt genuine.. Something i haven't felt before, but nope. Gone. Oh? And she got with my best friend shortly after!! And guess what? He didnt ask me, let me know.. Or nothing, i had to figure it out myself and when i did.. I just, still didn't do anything.. Before i found out, he actually told my other friends that he asked me, and i let him.. I did not. But still, i didn't do anything..

I used to love the feelings and the sounds of pure joy and unconditional happiness. but now a part of me is missing. that part of me is gone.

"Things aren’t going to get better for me, I’m a lost cause","I’m so incredibly lost, I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I have no friends, I have nothing to look forward to, everything is so fucking expensive and I really just want to end it. I’m so tired of being depressed and my family telling me to get my shit together. “No one can do it but you” I know that, I know I can do anything unless as I put my mind to it but the thing is you have to want it. I simply don’t, I don’t think this life is worth living. For what? So I can work my life away at a job I don’t even like, take a vacation maybe once or twice a year if I’m lucky and spend a majority of my life alone doing mundane tasks until I die a slow painful death. I don’t want to hurt my family by committing suicide but I can’t possibly see a reality where I’m content, mental health help is a fucking joke. I’ve tried everything, I’ve been on meds, I’ve gone to therapy. Several different types: TMS, neurofeedback, qi gong, EFT, EMDR, equine therapy, reiki etc. we are not meant to live like this. We are social creatures and we live in a society that is ultra independent, we need community but “third places” hardly exist anymore and how do people have time or money for hobbies ? I feel like everything we were told about growing up was a fucking lie. This shit sucks and it’s probably only going to get worse and I don’t want to be around to see it.

Does cognition ever improve after long-term depression?,"
25F, struggling with depression and c-ptsd since the age of 16, as well as with newer additional trauma from last year. My mind has become increasingly foggy and empty to the point where I find it difficult to think and articulate. I excelled in HS, got through a five-year/integrated masters in applied mathematics with decent grades (although with so severe cognitive, sleep and emotional issues that I had to postpone several exams and used an extra term to finish my masters), and lately it has gotten so bad that I’m embarrassed to be around people and struggle to trust myself with anything that requires attention to detail. I’ve mostly lost my thought processes, and am terrified that I will never feel like a thinking human being again or be able to function on a normal level. Mathematics used to bring me a lot of joy, but less than two years after writing my thesis I can no longer do it at all.

It’s bad enough how much I don’t want to be living and all the shit that goes with it. And so much self harm and si thinking. But now the awful and repetitive pain caused by my arrogant and ignorant nMom makes me want to kill myself even more bc my suffering and pain are a joke to her.   Around her I become someone else - evil. She only cares about what’s easy and comfortable for her.   She will hang me out to dry or fuck me over no problem.  And later will say all the things - my brain and body are broken from a lot of multiple chronic illnesses and the treatment I receive and the minimizing of how difficult it is for me to keep up or follow her crazy.  

Idk.  Maybe posting wrong place.  I’m just so beat up.  And it doesn’t stop.  And if I let my guard down just a bit it gets worse.   I’ve become horror angry and I think violent.  I am so ashamed but so out of control.   No one to talk with.  Just a few ppl know and say don’t do it.   I’m not alive.  I’m just hollowed out she’ll walking thru motions.   The heartbroken ness is sharp and jagged.  Im cut up inside.  

Upping lots of pills and trying to make myself commit to a plan.   I can’t understand anything.  And I’m sorry to God my faith is so pathetic.  I know I just cannot do.   I hate myself.   Maybe someone here understands me some or idk.   Im just so disgusted with myself and my life.  I cannot deal with hating my senior citz nMom.   I think she is lazy and evil.   Selfish and self concerned.  I hate her.  I don’t want to hate anyone.   I don’t know how to navigate any of this.  Sorry.  Hope for you in your situation too.

Can’t let go of my fiancés past. It’s crippling me.. ,"Can’t get over his past..

Having trouble letting go of my fiance’s past.

Hey there, so I met someone online in the year 2021, and we started dating. It was quite serious and was a commitment to get married eventually. The relationship was short lived since he had an all time low in his life by this time. He lost all his finances, his father met with An accident right in front of him home and slipped into a coma and he felt too much for himself and couldn’t deal with any of it , also because he is autistic I think. He ended up breaking up with me. The same day we broke up, he had a meeting in a different city and since he couldn’t afford a hotel room ended up staying at a colleagues place. They both were drunk , and she “got all over him” and they ended up having sex. Now be says he never wanted it, never planned it or such but it just happened and he regretted it deeply right after. And at this point he never thought we would ever speak again. But he could just not let me go for the next 5 months because he somehow thought he could make the money to come to me. But when he realized he couldn’t at this time and had too much for himself he decided to put a stop to it. Also, he started dating someone in these 5 months to make money off of her and entertained me at the same time. 

Fast forward to a year after , he comes back to my life and we end up meeting for the first time and falling in love all over again. Everything was great for over a year except for some fights here and there. But we were happy. Now we are in long distance for a few months until our marriage and I’m crippled by his past and what he has put me through. I just can’t seem to get over it. 

He is a great human being now, he’s changing so much and developed so much. He has redeemed himself and has come clean about a lot and makes sure I feel safe and secure no matter what. But, I can’t seem to let the past go. And idk what to do anymore. Idk if time will heal or it’ll never get better. Kindly let me know your take. I really want to let go of the past, forget even - if possible. I want to be with him for who he is today but somehow the past is crippling..

lost again,"It all started when the love of my life 'S' broke up with me. I couldn't handle it. I would lock myself in my room, rarely stepping out or talking to anyone. My father took me to a psychiatrist, and I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, anxiety, and panic disorder. Since 2014, I’ve been on meds. The doctor tried to take me off them many times, but I just couldn't handle it and had to go back for consultations.

This January, the doctor finally took me off the meds. I was happy, thinking I had defeated depression and moved on from her. Since then, I haven't been on any medication.
Fast forward to last week. One of my close friends 'A' is getting married, and we were talking about how everyone is either married or getting married. Then he drops the bombshell: 'S' got married last month ('A' is good friends with S). This news shouldn’t have affected me, I hadn’t thought about her in years. But as soon as I heard it, my world turned upside down. My hands and legs started shaking, my heart pounding heavily, and all the memories came rushing back. I couldn’t stand or comprehend what A was saying. After all these years, it shouldn’t have hurt, but it broke me. It felt like someone stabbing me in the heart.

Since that day, I’ve been having daily panic attacks. I’m not able to work in the office. Im just there, keeping my head down on the desk most of the time and in the restroom. I wake up in the middle of the night covered in sweat, breathing heavily, my mind replaying all those memories of us together. I sit in the corner of my room, my heart pounding in my chest like a hammer. I feel hungry, but if I eat, I just throw up from the nausea.

This feels like a living nightmare. I should have moved on. I feel like a pathetic loser who can’t even get over one heartbreak.. But deep down, I still love her, and I’m happy for her.
I think I’m losing my sanity, there are these voices in my head that won’t stop talking about her.

Need advice,"I guess I wanted to make this post because I want to gain some advice or reassurance in my understanding of why I have experienced mental health issues relating to anxiety and depression for the past 7 years (since I was 18, now 25). I want to share a background of my experience with these issues and hopefully gain some insight to how I should move forward, because it has been a constant struggle. Like everyone's mental health experience, it is unique to them and it is extremely complicated, stemming from an array of different things such as childhood trauma, nutrient deficiency,, microbiome health, etc. 

Background:

Finishing highschool was definitely the trigger to my first anxiety episode. Navigating what I wanted to do with my life was stressful and I felt as if for the first time in my life, I did not have a clear path. At the time, I didn't even know it was anxiety, but during the year after highschool it was like a flip switched inside of me and hasn't been the same since. Not to say there werent times where I was anxious in childhood, because there definitely was, but this was the first time I really felt the physical and mental effects of suffering from anxiety. This was presented in OCD like behavior with repetitive thought patterns, overthinking, physical tension in chest and stomach (like an urge to cry), insomnia and other symptoms of anxiety. I ended up going straight into full time work and struggled these things regularly but would go days or weeks of not feeling symptoms. It was always irregular and I never knew why I was feeling these things. I have always been healthy and conscious of my diet, sleep, exercise and was never abusing drugs or alcohol so it was a bit of a shock when these symptoms “randomly” occurred. I was determined to find an underlying biological or physical reason for these feelings and have and still do try supplements, more exercise, eliminating certain foods, regular sleep etc which all help to an extent but have never actually resolved any issues.

These issues persisted and it was shitty but I was able to manage myself and it never really spiraled until I had a bad insomnia episode a couple of years later. This was a combination of the anxiety I had in general which ended up causing anxiety around going to sleep and they just fed off each other. After really struggling for a couple of months I decided to try medication and was given lexapro. Once the lexapro started working, for the first time in ages I felt a sense of normalcy. I was stable, my random anxious thoughts and feelings in my body were gone, I genuinely felt like the best version of myself. My sleep was good again and I stayed on lexapro for about 9 months before deciding I wanted to come off, thinking I had healed my brain of whatever weird neurological misfirings that caused these problems. I hadnt been to therapy at all at this point but I was so determined that I had cured these problems and didn't want to stay on a medication for whatever reason - I think I was ashamed of being on medication and was also scared of staying on them long term. 

For almost a year after I stayed off medication and continued to try to heal myself naturally. I had improved with understanding these feelings, I had a better grasp of the causes or what my anxious brain thinks that's wrong with my external environment. I finished my degree and was working full time doing something unrelated to my studies and had decided to move cities and also had just been accepted to a serious full time job. The stresses of these triggered an insomnia episode again and I said fuck it, ill go back on the medication. However, this time the lexapro didn't work and for some reason made me feel depressed. I hadn't really understood what depression was like but now with what I know, its closely related to anxiety. Anyway, I moved cities and although my life improved because I made new friends, was enjoying living out of home, moved to a place I really like, felt less lonely I still had these shitty feelings. I came of the lexapro after trying it for 2 months and decided to get prescribed a different medication. I was determined for this one to work and was put on zoloft. The zoloft killed my anxiety but made me even more depressed. My moods were very up and down. Zoloft didnt work for me either and I decided I really needed to go to therapy instead of using a medication (I know, I should of gone to therapy long before any of this but it was hard as I didnt communicate properly to my parents or friends and wanted to solve the issues on my own.

I went for 10 therapy sessions and learnt a lot of information about myself that I didn't know. I believe the stuff I learnt gave me a clearer perspective of the disorder in a way I hadn't seen it. That is, that it has deep roots in my subconscious brain that stemmed from things that happened in childhood. This was helpful for sure and improved some aspects of it but I was still struggling everyday with these feelings. I weaned myself off the zoloft and stayed off it for a couple of months before ending up going back to the doctor in distress asking for a new medication. I tried Lexapro again for 2 months and it didn't work. I was also going through a lot of stress from a breakup, at this time so I think this may have impacted the efficacy of my third time trying lexapro. The lexapro was making me feel shit so I tried prozac. Again, for two months I stayed on prozac and hated it. This one by far made me feel the worst. I felt like a zombie. That was about 4 months ago. Situationally everything has improved and I am a lot happier with things objectively speaking. They are the best they've ever been but I'm still a mess and have this depression/anxiety that will present itself all the time. I am booked into therapy again which I am excited for. But I don't know what to do. I feel like I have tried everything. 

I have read a lot about psilocybin therapy and have used psilocybin many times recreationally but I want to explore a high dose trip alone, and hopefully find some sort of cure to this disease. I understand it's not going to be a quick fix thing but I am losing hope and desperately want to do something to heal myself. I think starting therapy again and doing a big trip will be beneficial. Its fucking annoying that everything in my life is great, yet I will randomly and sporadically get these thoughts and feelings. At the moment it's a lot of depression. I hate how it makes me spiral. I want some advice on whether I should try another medication. I loved the first time I was on it and it worked but i'm afraid of doing the whole trial and error thing and experiencing all the side effects like I did the other times.I want to find something that will work for me and stay on it long term.

Idk what I need ,"I came to this sub because I thought maybe someone would understand me and my never ending thoughts of not being here anymore. Then I found myself wanting to remind everyone why they deserve to see another tomorrow. For some reason, I just don’t see myself as worthy of life the same way I see it for others.

Like no matter how much good I try to pour into others, there’s just nothing that will ever make me worthy of staying alive. And who would really miss me? Likely my family and friends, my bf. But they would and could all move on. Because do I really matter anyways? Would it be fair to them to have to suffer that grief ? No, not at all. And honestly that’s what’s really keeping me here.

Sometimes I don't want to let go of my pain and trauma because it's the only thing that feels solely mine,"And I know it's not good. I know I need to let go of the pain in order to start getting better. I've already healed a lot since I was removed from my traumatic circumstance, but part of me always holds onto a bit of that resentment towards the world. 

Nobody has experienced exactly what I went through because no two people have the same exact feelings and experiences. In a way, that brings me comfort. It is not something I have to or can share with anyone else. It is 100% ""me"", 100% ""fine"", so I keep that bitterness so that sometimes I can just...be angry. I can be angry at the world and nobody else can feel that same anger and for once I feel like a complete individual. For once I don't have to share something. 

I don't know. Maybe I need some sort of ego death. It's strangely cathartic though. My pain is mine and nobody else can have it and something about that feels good, even if it always ends up hurting me. 

It must be part of the depression, right? I don't know if anyone else feels this way, though. ",thr-w-w-y3,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1dve5/sometimes_i_dont_want_to_let_go_of_my_pain_and/

Struggling with jobs and mental health. ,"Hi all. 

I have struggled with depression and anxiety from the age of 14, I’m 31 this month. 

I have worked since the age of 15 at various different jobs, I finally thought I’d found one now that was okay while I started to apply to study to go forward to apply for a probation officer program. 

My job is becoming stressful, a lot of pressure and I just can’t cope - I feel it’s impacting my mental health again, my anxiety is through the roof and I’m looking to apply for other jobs with less responsibility so I can do my job and head off home after not worrying sick. 

In the last 2/3 years there’s been jobs that have been terrible, I was bullied out of a job because I spoke up about the way things that weren’t right and it’s just destroyed any confidence I may have had. 

I can feel myself spiralling again into crisis like I was at the start of the year and I just don’t know what to do anymore, it’s starting to develop into intense suicidal thoughts with serious intention again. 

I try so hard, I try my best and work as hard as I can and it just feels like it’s never good enough and it always goes wrong. I’m just so tired of it all now, not just how many times I can keep going through this cycle.  

The GP offers little support and CMHT refused to take me on or even assess me, so I’m at a loss of where to turn. My partner is very supportive but I don’t want to put too much on him either, as it’s not fair at all.

Hi everyone..,"Hello everyone,

I've never used the internet this way, but today I hope it will be beneficial because I really feel that I need it. Let's start...

I am a young man, an only child, who recently turned 20. I lived with my father and mother until I was 19, but one day my mother left home for another man. This affected me greatly because we were a very close-knit family of three, and it affected my father even more. Today, it's almost been five months since I found my father deceased by suicide. That day, he left me a letter that I will simplify: he told me that he adored me and that I couldn't even imagine how much, and that he was very proud of me. He then told me to never stop, to continue and reach my dreams, and that he would always be there with me, anywhere, anytime, he would accompany me. But he also said something: he was sorry for not being the father I would have wanted. Yet he knew very well how proud I was of him and how much I loved him. He was the center of my universe. But knowing my father, he always wanted more for his family and convinced himself that he wasn't good for me. But if he knew how perfect he was in my eyes...

Today, I live with my uncle (my father's brother) and my cousins. Why am I not with my mother? Because everything happened so quickly: my mother, the loss of my father... It wasn't the right time for me to live with her and her new man. And recently, I learned from a reliable source that she had cheated on my father before leaving him, so I am very confused with everything I'm going through. I know that time will heal things, but time moves forward for me and no longer for my father, and that enrages me.

Now, the real reason for this post is that I too am now thinking about ending this life of suffering. There's not a day that goes by without me thinking about it. Currently, I only continue for my father, my family, and my friends... but what about me in all this? When I sit down and take two minutes, I really struggle to see the beauty in this life. Yes, I have dreams and ambitions, but it seems like nothing makes sense anymore, everything tastes nostalgic... I've thought of ways to end it and the places, but only in thought, so I haven't taken any actions yet, but I feel it could happen... I want to live, but I have such a bitter taste from my experience on this earth now. When I argue, for example with my uncle, even over simple things, I automatically think: what's the point in continuing? I realize that I'm really staying here for my loved ones. I could probably write to you endlessly, but I'll stop here for now. It did me good to write this.

"If it isn’t today, it’ll be sometime next week.","I am planning on killing myself soon. If it isn’t today, it will definitely be next week. The pressure of college tuition is too much for me to handle. I am going to an out of state public college that is charging me $7k left over of tuition from $15,000. They expect me to pay it by August 9th &amp; I cannot afford to pay $1400 every month. My loans can’t even pay for it. My parent cannot afford to get a parent plus loan because they are in default. They encouraged me to go to this college for the experience and left me in the dust once finances came into the conversation. We are not rich at all, in fact, we are damn near poor. I cannot express in words how upset I am for listening to them. I was so excited about going and now I am on the verge of dying.

I’ve applied to plenty of scholarships and my parent acts like I don’t apply to any because I complain about having to do them. You would complain too if you’d have to write essays on top of essays and ask for recommendation letters just to not receive anything. Not even a letter confirming that I didn’t get it. I am currently waiting on a response for 36 scholarships, got denied 7 and only got 2 local ones that add up for $2,000. Even that doesn’t pay off the amount of money I owe my college. 

Community college is not an option. I told my parent about maybe going there first because I actually cared about debt and they shot it down immediately because they believe community college is only for dummies and that because I was an honor roll student that I should go to my dream college. Them being my parent, I listened to them because the adult is always right, right? I was wrong.

I can no longer live. The amount of stress I deal with almost every day thinking about my tuition is unbelievable. I can’t live without stressing. Every day is stressful. My job can’t pay my tuition off. I can’t live knowing I got kicked out of my dream college for being too poor to pay off my tuition.",Plane_Primary_2408,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3d288/if_it_isnt_today_itll_be_sometime_next_week/

33M early child hood trauma ruined my life before it even started ,"33M early child hood trauma ruined my life before it even started 


I honestly don't know where to start, but for background my mom left when I was probably in 1st or 2nd grade, just straight up moved to England ""mom is moving to england love you bye"" and left me with an abusive father. Dad taught me about porn at around age 8 or 9. I was molested by three different individuals (sons, or nephews of women he dated) between ages of most likely 11-14. One of them actually tw raping me. 

I've always been shorter in stature, and was picked on all throughout school. Something that did not help, as well was that my dad had a habit of approaching any girl around my age, in public to ask them if they wanted to date me. This started happening around 4th grade. ( Around the time my dad introduced me to porn). He would approach almost any girl, rather it be someone at the grocery store, it be someone selling girl scout cookies, it could be cheerleaders but he would do this routinely to the point that I would be ridiculed at school for this behavior. Of course, these girls would decline, or be like ew no gross, and I was often ""fake asked out"" a lot and would have things thrown at me, or like chocolate milk dumped on my head. This lead to a very strong fear of women, and fear of rejection I still deal with. 

My dad was also verbally, and emotionally, and physically abusive. If I would talk back he would shove me against a wall, and put his forearm against my throat and slap me, spit in my mouth, lick my face. He would tell me that no one would love me, and would use the girls going ew gross as examples and proof. I was also physically weaker than most other kids my age, due to a neurological condition that caused me to be under-developed, lacked coordination. 

One of my primary outlets, has always been the computer. Anime, video game type stuff. Fantasy stuff.  A habit I had picked up, was chatroom roleplaying in the late 90s, early 2000s in the AOL/Yahoo days, that started when I lived with my dad. I eventually ran away, to a different state, where a girl I was speaking with I had a crush on lived where my mom had moved back to and my grandma lived. I continued this habit after I moved, the summer after my freshman year and because I didn't know anyone I kept the habit of really having a majority of my social life on yahoo chat/aol.  

I was eventually groomed by an older woman, when I was like 16 into liking femdom type roleplay. This mostly hit a few dopamine receptors in whatever my most likely un-diagnosed autistic brain where I didn't have to ""guess"" if a girl was into me or not, if she was the one ""bossing"" me around. 

I stopped talking to this woman, my junior year, after a girl I went to school with admitted to liking me and we talked and dated for an extremely short time, all of it ending when she kissed me and I froze completely mostly due to being a completely anxious buffoon, but also due to my body having a fear/anxiety response from all the previous trauma/molestation where I just completely froze. She stopped talking to me not long after, and started calling me a pussy after I revealed some of the previous information about my past/dad to her as to ""why"" I froze. Also because I was 17 almost 18 and this was the first girl, and I still think only girl, to ever actually show any genuine interest me and I still regret dropping the ball on this. ( Though, she was known as a serial cheater, has 3 different baby daddy's now but I hold no ill will to her as she has had an extremely hard laugh and I ""recognized her scars"" which is why I fell for her back then. )

To be honest, high school after I moved was 10000x better and I actually came out of my shell even though I still had a lot of healing to do, unfortunately with a neglectful mom, and step-dad who didn't recognize, or care to recognize obvious signs of needing therapy. ( mom didn't know about the extent of the abuse back then, just the physical, but I still should have been in therapy. ) 

After highschool, and going to college I did get a car thankfully gifted to me from an older woman in my grandmas community. But I was 100% locked down to the house and could hardly go anywhere. (This was around 2010 and job market in my area sucked and I didn't actually get a job until 2014. mostly because I went to college but no job experience early on even for McDonalds wouldn't hire me, really hurt me, also because I was a quiet/nervous stammering idiot. )  

Eventually during college because my parents didn't allow me to go anywhere, took my keys etc, I fell back into habits of going online, and roleplaying. A user from the yahoo days had made a site for roleplay that was adult oriented though I rarely did anything of that except with people I had written with for awhile, and I started going there again. This is an action I regret to this day. 

Eventually, some drama started between me, and a different user where he started posing as me instigating drama/telling people I was drama. He accused me of harassing myself, eventually proved this wasn't the case, but drama from him posing as me continued, and eventually linked back to an account that was a more smut/sex RP account that was extremely oriented to violence against women, non-con, type writing (meaning he wanted someone to write as a woman for him to basically abuse.) Not kink shaming, but dude was/is a weirdo. Exposed this fact that the account was his and I started receiving threats that he was going to ruin my life. 

For years on that site I had him posing as me, stealing characters I made and making profiles as them to pose as me, mass spamming/block evading people posing as me to stir drama, to the point that he also found out information about me IRL and harassed IRL friends.

I lost a lot of friends due to the nature of the harassment, and the drama surrounding it. My response to it. ( A lot of validation seeking, are you mad at me, it isn't me please believe me type stuff. I was probably 24-ish around this time. ) Around this time, I had actually gone to the cops, but was given nothing more than a cyberbullying pamphlet. Told they couldn’t help me. Contact the FBI, I did but never got a response. There was also a rape accusation as well where my female friends were messaged from someone saying "" OP raped my friend"".  I went to a lawyer about this, and because I was a dirt-poor college student at the time and as no actual criminal accusation had been made was to ignore it. Was told specifically "" you'd be a fucking idiot to walk into a police station and say "" i got accused of rape, but its a lie please help me "" you'd be stuck in jail "" and because I couldn't afford a criminal lawyer, nor a lawyer to help me with the false accusations it was best to just drop it. 

I stopped taking care of myself, I gained over 70lbs probably over the course by just not caring. Not going out, because I didn’t want to run into people like I knew who were harassed, or other individuals who were targeted and have these things brought up, because as a nervous, shy guy, with a stutter if I was confronted, I didn’t have proof of any of the stuff at the time, I didn’t want to admit “oh yeah I was groomed as a kid, and later as an adult started going on a cyber/smut roleplay site for adults where a psycho stalker got mad I outed him for liking to do rape stories and decided to ruin my life because I found out hes a freak” because that would have resolved the situation, or not have completely scared people off. As well, I'm sure a lot of people just got tired of me, and cut me out due to A) I’m a friend who betrayed their trust, and crossed boundaries, B) I’m a vile person who cannot be trusted or C) there is too much drama surrounding me, rather true, or not where it isn’t worth the risk to them to interact with me and the possible exposure, or risk to themselves it might bring.  
  
  
  
I'm now 33, and because of the severe depression I have from all of this have to spend about 25k to get dental implants because I've completely let myself go. Bright side, I'm down from my all time high of 235lbs to 205-ish and hoping to get back down to 150 before end of year or at least this time next year. I think a lot of what I lose was water weight.

Should I start taking them again,"I 20F started antidepressants for around 3-4months and it benefited me a lot. I felt happy and if not happy then extremely at peace… most of the time.
The downside was I’d have random nausea every now and then, I gained weight, was often tired, low sex drive (would rarely be able to finish) and even though it helped with my low moods, I have bipolar 2 and i swear it did nothing for my hypomania (not that I’m sure it was even supposed to help with that).
Having barely any energy and gaining weight started to make me so insecure which was making me unhappy so I stopped them suddenly which I didn’t know until recently that is not a good idea.
Anyways I’m losing weight and working out more since I have more energy and not eating as much as I used to (not under eating but no longer over eating) but the bad thoughts are back, I’m starting to feel unhappy and more anxious again. 
So now I feel like I’m stuck and can’t decide what to do:
Option 1: take them and feel mentally stable when I’m home but anytime I’m out in public I’m so insecure because I’m gaining weight and don’t have energy to exercise which would make me sad.
Option 2: don’t take them, risk going back to bad habits to cope but even if I find healthier ways to cope and I lose the weight and feel confident while I’m out, often when I’m home I can’t sleep, I’m overthinking and crying a lot.

I have it all. And I am still empty and I want to go. ,"Throwaway account 

I just build a house with my wife. I never wanted to do it but because I had/have troubles saying what is important to me we did it. And by we I mean me. I coordinated everything, worked my ass of while it was build and had an extremely tense and devastating year of 2023. my batteries were empty when the construction phase ended and I was deeply depressed. Then the moment came and we moved in and I have to say that I hate the house. On the one hand it’s loud and build on a place I never wanted to live but if I am truly honest, it’s the house itself. Everything it stands for - the way my life turned out and how it is filled with things I never wanted. I fell into a deep state of depression, lost 10kg (20lbs) since march and was crying almost every day. But I pulled myself out of this hole by going to my therapist, doing sports and then eventually taking medicine against my anxiety. I found some ground again when I was recognizing something on my stomache while doing some woodwork and I went to the hospital. 2 hours later I was in the OR getting operated on my belly. Everything was good, I went home, fell in the same depression and was hit by extreme pain 2 days later. Went to the hospital again and had to stay 7 more days because my wound was infected. Now I have to rest since 6 weeks. Can’t do sports, can’t really move and I am deeply unhappy. I find happy moments while doing music and I was brave (or call it dumb) and went to a concert this week. Wasn’t too good for the wound but I needed this. However there is this constant flow of darkness surrounding me and it just is there all the time. A couple of weeks ago at my lowest point I made plans to kill myself. Now they are reappearing over and over again. I stand up - I feel helpless - I count the hours on the clock until the day is over and I restart again. I am so lost. I hate this house, I hate my life, I am beginning to fall apart from my relationship, to my friends I feel like I am a liar and I can’t get rid of this constant pain. I don’t feel any good. I hate myself so much for this. I am sitting in a fancy new house, with a wife that loves me, yes I had surgery but that’s gonna heal and if I want to I can be a father soon. And so many would die for this - and I want to die because of it. What is fucking wrong with me???

Why Bother? ,"I’m fat, short, autistic, epileptic, can’t work, can’t drive, and failing my family by existing and not bringing in money. 

My husband needs someone who can provide for him and his chronic illness. Not me. Our gf has a good job. Maybe if I’m gone, then they can get married and try to have a happy life with our dog and our ferret. 

I can’t even bring children into this world because I don’t have insurance. My mother intentionally made it so I would fail at the most basic level of adulthood because she hated me. How am I supposed to make this work when no one believes me or believes in me? 

I’m supposed to take a train next month… maybe I’ll just get off at the next stop and disappear. Whatever that means. Or just leave my stuff behind and step in front of said train. It’ll be over if I do. I’ve already got a will. Any stuff I have goes to my husband, as long as he’s alive.

Feeling so lost,"I’m a 39/f and recently had my first child. My relationship with my partner has become increasingly more strained since our child was born. My partner does not have to do much for our child, as I do it all. I do expect some help every now and then, but I do 99% of the childcare. I have not worked since June 1, so I’m totally dependent on my partner, though I can get a job in my field but would need to pay out several hundred dollars for up to date licensures and other necessities, which I currently don’t have. My partner tends to get into these moods where they stay aggravated and frustrated for hours to days. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells, like I can’t live in my own home. My partner also gets frustrated when they have the baby and the baby cries or can’t settle. I’ve explained that this is just the baby right now and we have to take the good with the bad. 
I finally asked my partner what I could do to make things easier or better, because I cannot handle walking on eggshells when they won’t communicate with me. My partner said that it sounds like I want it to end because I do everything and they do nothing. I never said that and I never said I wanted it to end, but that is their go to Everytime I try to voice a concern. 

I have no money of my own, the house is mine but I couldn’t afford the mortgage alone right now, let alone the rest of the bills and stuff for my child. 

If this ends, I will have my partner take the baby to their family’s to visit and I will end it. It seems like the easiest solution and then I’d be out of this misery. I love my child but I cannot live life like this. I just want it all to end.

my 13 year old sister is feeling suicidal and i dont know how to approach her,"im 16, me and my sister never really talked about stuff like this, nor did she and my parents (including me). when i was her age i was severely depressed aswell, but i had nobody to talk to so i had to deal with everything myself. plus i had severe social anxiety which made me feel more alone so i never fully got the concept of having support in my life, or going to therapy or even having real friends to talk to. btw, im somewhat okay now

  
moving on to my sister: shes somewhat social. she hit puberty over half a year ago. she completely changed her looks. she started wearing black, baggy clothes and spends one hour doing full face make up, which our family wasnt so happy of, including me, since it was so sudden and she doesnt even need it. but honestly i dont care about these things. anyway, she has a couple of friends but ive heard she has gotten into a fight with one of them which she has mentioned a couple of times to me and my family but we kinda brushed it off since she didnt really wanna talk about it either. then she has gotten a boyfriend, whom she broke up with 2 weeks later into the relationship because he cheated. and honestly she didnt seem affected by it, i think its clear why. 

main thing she does is keep her room really messy. like insanely messy. about 5 hrs age there was leftover food on the floor, flies everywhere, sticky desk, make up stains everywhere and so on.... my dad were obvously not happy. he came and had a meltdown about her room. yesterday and today to the point where he took her phone. i could tell my sister was upset cuz she didnt go out at all, only to the bathroom for like 5mins. and this happens quite often. i can relate to this aswell, i could even say its normal in our family to get yelled at this much for our rooms but its really apparent she doesnt take it well. on top of that my parents tell everyone INCLUDING ME that she has an ""additue"" and she needs to fix it. but its just her being upset for my dad contantly yelling at her. theres many other things id mention but it would be too much. and on top of that, one of her friends moms told our mom that my sister and her friend were talking about how shes self harming, how she feels worthless ect. and its just so weird to me, why are u spying on my sister? and after that incident she has been wwearing a hoodie for the past 2 weeks. keep in mind its really hot where we live. and its just overall unusual.

  
anyway, i dont use tiktok, snd she does every day. so i had the random thought to check out her account, and it was full of depressed stuff. she was talking about how in her mind, shes fat,and she should stop eating less, or how she was hurting herself and had suicidal thoughts just because our parents got mad because she didnt clean her room. and thats when i got the idea of telling this to someone, because i seriously dont know how to approach this. maybe i should tell my mom, since shes more understanding than my dad. but talking to my sister wouldnt be a great idea since like i said, im still healing from my own things. i dont know how to confort people let alone my sister that im not that close with to this extend.

Don’t know what to do anymore / Rant,"
Im 17f, and a military brat to start this off. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve dealt with major rage issues, I’ve slammed and broken iPads, computers, household items, punched walls, etc you get the point. This, mixed with a dad with PTSD (and probably bipolar) and a sister with audhd made home hell. It felt like constantly walking on eggshells.

For a while in my life, the mix of my dad being a chronic asshole and my mom just trying to enjoy her life lead to lots of fighting. A lot. There were months where there would be screaming matches every day between parents, where computer mice were being thrown through walls from across the house (impressive throw though) or smaller things broken. This usually ended with a “we’re getting a divorce” (spoiler, it never happened), being threatened hundreds of times. Whenever I talked to my sister, it turned into a game of rules, what can I say not to peeve her, what can I listen to on my phone, what can I do in her presence to not bother her, which a lot of times ended up happening anyways. When we were kids, whenever we argued we were told to just shut up, and we’ve grown up hearing yelling, so when we disagree nowadays we do just that. It turns into a game of who can hurt the other more. This makes my relationship with her very rocky, we’ll go from pissed to happy to pissed again, to once again happy within the same day, every day.

When I was a kid, things started popping up early, me scratching myself at 6-7, moving onto poking myself with needles when I was 8-9. This only got worse as I went to blades. My parents swear it’s a teenage thing, but because of the ages mentioned I don’t think it is. I’ve always felt this way. A mix of how easily I flip out now, and how I treat myself and others, my family sometimes treats me like I’m just crazy, which pisses me off more and makes me start insulting them. I know part of it is pent up anger, but I’m starting to think they’re right. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I cannot get myself to get up and go to school anymore, I’ll miss 70+ days a year even though my school is only half the average school day. 4 hours. I cannot handle 4 hours of school. In turn, my dad yells. I cannot keep friends, I go through a phase where I’m obsessed with one friend, then I ghost everyone else and sometimes even said friend I’m fixated on in the moment, simply as a “do they care”, and even if they do message me I continue doing so. This makes friendships hard, I’m constantly finding a new friend every few months, even though I have others messaging me asking to hang out. I scream at my family, I ghost my friends, I cannot keep my room cleaned to save my life, ive been pushing for a psychiatrist for years because of my doctor suggesting potential adhd, and a mix of my parents not wanting to accept both of their children can have issues and psychiatrists full on ignoring us because the area we live in is godawful when it comes to mental health is making it impossible. I’ve tried anti depressants, and it hasn’t worked much, and I don’t benefit those around me. 

As a kid I was an edgelord, and I still am I guess, when I was 7-8 I watched gore, I won’t say the website but it was a very well known site. It was a mix of morbid curiosity and outlet, maybe I was partly trying to understand my dad at the time with his combat related ptsd, why he was so mean. I used to flex this to my friends, describe all the gnarly details as if it was something to show off, then I’d go home and watch that same thing. I know now how cringey that was. The issue is is that habit stuck, I still find myself visiting those sites, and doing mass research into any crime that sounded interesting to read. I know it’s cringey. Although, suicide videos always stuck out to me since I was a kid, it always being an escape in the back of my mind because of it.

Now I’m here, I just got done being left on hold for over an hour while trying to get ahold of a psychiatrist again, I’ve been hospitalized for attempts before, you’d think they’d care more but it’s been years of this. Years of being given referrals to clinics that don’t take my families insurance or just flat out ignore us. There is nothing I can do anymore. I feel so done with it all. No one’s taking new patients. I’m sick of screaming at my family, I’m sick of making my friends feel like shit because I can’t message back, I’m sick of feeling my heart get torn in two every time I get a message telling me that a friend is done with me, and I’m sick of being forced through these overwhelmingly strong emotions with nothing helping.

This is probably very poorly written but I do not care, i feel like a broken record and I don’t think I want to continue ts. I cannot believe how much the mental health system has failed me, I tried getting help, and got ignored. They couldn’t care less about me and I’m done giving a shit in a life where no one else does

Slowly going insane. ,"I don't know where to turn. I'm so damn lost and need help.. I think I may be clinically insane. I don't know. I have real bad anxiety and PTSD as well as depression and I am extremely sensitive. This whole thing is getting to the point that I might eventually unalive myself. It sucks when even your family doesn't want you around because of it. They feel like they are stuck with me. I'm being cut off because of this and only people who seem to care are my friends. I've had a rough childhood and what makes matters worse is the fact that my family was the cause of it and now they want to throw me away. 

When I was two I had to step on glass just to get their attention to see if they loved me. 

When I was expelled from middle for making a threat for being bullied I was punished and for almost a year. Anything I said or did lead to more punishment.

My grandmother tried pushing me down the stairs calling me an ungrateful child. 

My mother has called me a burden and wished I was never born. 

When my step father hit me in the face she was mad at ME. 

I tried to kill myself when I was 17. Instead of my mom trying to figure out what was wrong she yelled at me. 

I've been suffering for so long and my family KNEW something was wrong with me. Instead of being proactive they just let it fester and now that it has gotten this bad they refuse to deal with me. 

What hurts is that NONE of them will tell me the truth. Even when I ask. They will tell me I'm over thinking only to literally talk shit about me for HOURS on in about how crazy I am about how sick I am. Forget all the bad shit they have ever done to me right.

It's really hard for me to interact with people and finding a job is hard when I get an interview I am so nervous I do not get the job. So that worries me but I can't put up with the abuse any more..

My entire life is about to change and I can't cope. Depressed for the first time in my life,"I've been living with my ex gf for 5 years. It's been a really long time and she was my first ever gf. We broke up roughly a year and a half ago but we have still been living together with her two cats (who we got as kittens 5 years ago). We've had our ups and downs and argue sometimes, but we also laugh together and I do enjoy talking to her.

A few weeks ago, she suddenly told me that she will be moving to her own place. I understand why she wants to, but it just came as a shock to me. My little brother is in a bad situation at the moment, and he comes here every week to stay with us. He looked extremely sad and worried when I told him that I'll have to leave, and this made me more upset.

To make matters worse, she's taking the cats (who I have bonded with and lived with since they were kittens). She's leaving today and I'm really dreading it and feel extremely upset about it. I'll move to my grandmother's house in a few weeks, and I'm REALLY not looking forward to that but I have no other option.

Another thing is that I have had a new serious relationship for roughly a year, but she also hasn't been able to live with me. And to make things even worse....it seems like she will break up with me soon. It kind of feels like I'm losing two people at once (along with my cats) and also won't be able to hang out with my little brother regularly anymore.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I might finally be able to realize my dream and live overseas in 6 months. Not having to pay rent anymore by living at my grandmother's house will enable me to save up and finally go. That makes me really nervous but I'm also excited as it is my dream.

I'm usually a happy-go-lucky person and rarely get sad, but this is the first time in my life that I feel genuinely depressed and really upset. Not sure how to handle it and would really appreciate some advice.

Something is wrong with me and I need some perspectives. ,"I don’t even know where to start.
I am in my late 20s and for the longest time, I have not been able to do much with my life or accomplish anything. 
A little background, I was good until highschool, I did more or less well academically and was pretty academically inclined, was considered smart and everything. The problem started when I finished highschool, I took a few years off(because of some issues) so I started college late, it already took a toll on my confidence and I felt too old and too late for everything. 

Eventually I finished college and I haven’t been able to accomplish anything else eversince. 
I blamed it all on my laziness, I rationalised myself blaming my failures on my laziness and lack of trying. 
But since last year, I really made a conscious effort to try. I really did try so hard mentally to focus on the task at hand, made small goals to accomplish, made a routine for myself. But I noticed that I could never focus on anything for more than 20 mins at most. Even though I would make a mental note to not let anything distract myself, I would find myself hours later being distracted by the smallest of things and would feel like shit for having wasted all those time and it would repeat all over again. 
I tried to lock my phone up somewhere far away from my room thinking it was the source of my distraction but my mind would still find something else to waste my time on. It became a mental torture at this point. 
It seems like I would rather do literally anything else than the task at hand it doesn’t even have to be enjoyable at that point. 
It’s like my mind has another mind of its own and i lose control of it. 
This has caused me some major distress. 

Another thing i’ve noticed that, nothing feels natural and comfortable to me. 
For example, even when i’m doing a simple task of doing laundry, holding my clothes or the jar of detergent feels uncomfortable and unnatural to me, like i’m not holding it properly or something. Everything I do feels wrong and uncomfortable. 


I just really need some perspective on this because i can’t access therapy at this point.

Get help soon,"I'm 29 years old and have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. The past year has been the worst it's ever been, living on autopilot, getting no joy out of almost everything, thoughts of dying daily. The one thing that would always keep me going was my wonderful girlfriend. Without her I'm not sure I'd be here today. Just being with her was enough to keep me going, she was the one thing that never failed to make me happy. I never shared any of this with her. I was so afraid of losing her if she saw how truly broken I am. The past year has been so rough, I know I haven't been the partner she deserves. I've felt so numb, stagnant, so tired and despite my efforts to hide these things they've bled through into my life. Making me into someone I wish I wasn't. She deserves so much more than that.

Loved one cannot choose to care about me if I choose to self sabotage.,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for my whole life. I have gotten significantly better, I am able to manage the illness better and it does not affect me in serious ways. I have support from loved ones and a safety plan in case things were to be bad again, but it has not been the case in several years. 



However, there are times I feel myself slipping into a depressive episode and fall back into my bad habits. Recently, I felt myself slipping into a episode, and I mustered the bit of energy I had to let my loved ones know that I needed some space and time alone. I chose to self isolate. The reason was because I needed time to process the emotions and felt like a burden to my loved ones. During this time, I was not able to think rationally and I was very critical of myself and I felt unworthy, ashamed and exhausted. The urge to self isolate hasn't happened in a long time, but I gave into that urge due to the strong emotions. When I felt a bit better after a few days, I reached out again. 



My loved one told me that he did not like this behaviour, and that if I were to self sabotage again he cannot choose to care about me anymore. 

He told me, a mistake only happens once and choosing to isolate, whether it is inconsistent or not, is a choice. If I get the urge to isolate and I act upon it, and there are times I don’t want help from my loved ones, then he just can’t continue to care for me. 

He said I am free to do as I please, withdraw from people, isolate myself. I just cannot expect him to care if I do. 

He said if I cannot allow someone who cares about me to help shoulder the burden of my pain and suffering, then his mental energy is better spent elsewhere.

What he said is completely valid. However, I think of this situation differently.



I think that life is very unpredictable and people will experience a lot of grief and a lot of pain that can make you lose sight of yourself. It can be extremely difficult to reach out for support when the illness is convincing you that you're unworthy. I don't know what will happen in the future, I know that I will probably make the same mistakes again and choose to self isolate. But I also know that during this time, I need my loved ones there for me no matter what. I need people to be there for me when I feel unworthy of love, ESPECIALLY when I feel unworthy of love. The more warmth I am shown, the more strength I will have to get out of the muck. It's a battle with the illness. It's not that I don't want support, it's that I believe I am unworthy of support. I constantly try to fight the negative thoughts that occur when I feel this way, somedays, it's too much for me and I give in and believe them. 



Now, I am very upset. I am sad because someone who I love very much and loves me very much said that to me. I have to accept that I will probably make the same mistake again, because I'm on the road to recovery, and I have to accept that if I do, he won't be there for me. 



Please let me know what you think of this situation, I am looking for advice and support, and different perspectives. Thank you.",jkbch,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2k4q9/loved_one_cannot_choose_to_care_about_me_if_i/
I feel too tired to live anymore,"My family is not my comfort zone. It never was. The older I get, the more weight I can feel on my shoulders. My mom has really high expectations of me. Since I was young I would always fight with my mom over everything, even the smallest thing like making a noise while eating. She‘s like a perfectionist and wants me to be like her too. I know she’s always telling me that it’s for my own sake but it’s too much for me to handle. I wasn’t good at school when I was young, so when my grades came out I always got scolded by her. She said things like, „Is it that hard to be good at school?“ „Why can’t you do something that easy?“ Can’t you be someone I can be proud of at least once?“ She does triggered some traumatic feelings of me. Because of what I went through I grew up with low self esteem and the feeling of being afraid of making mistakes. When we moved to another country I did my best with everything. I got better at school and even graduated from a prestigious university with a good degree. I thought maybe now my mom will be proud of me, but her reaction wasn’t like what I expected. She never praised me for my achievements and started to criticize me in other ways. She cares A LOT about what other people think about her. So I had to be the perfect daughter she can brag about. The problem was…I was never good enough for her. I don’t fit the beauty standard and I already know it but getting this told by my own mom always makes me feel hurt. She REALLY CARES A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE’S OPINIONS. I always get comments like “Why are you so fat?” “Did you gained weight again?” “I told you not to eat.” “You’ll never be beautiful if you continue to look this way” It’s not only my weight she cares about but also my face. She even had me do a nose job and a lip surgery to look better. I always have to wear Makeup and dress well when I go out. And she’ll always comment on my outfits like “why are you wearing wide jeans? It makes you look fat“ and even said things like „What are you doing? What will other people think of me because of your actions? They‘ll think I didn’t raised you right.“ I‘m so sick of those comments, there were a few times I wanted to end my life. I can’t be that perfect daughter she expects me to be. And because of that I‘m more fond of my friends than my family. But at the end I got betrayed a few times. Being kind and genuine to others doesn’t mean they’ll be kind and genuine to you. I never learned from the same mistakes until recently. Reality hit me hard. I feel like I don’t matter to anyone except they need something from me. I‘m always trying to help or at least be there for the people around me but no one is ever there for me. I do have a few good friends but most of them live in different countries now. Now I‘m at the age where I can earn my own money and treat myself to good things and even travel a lot. I feel like I do it to just escape reality in short term. But after coming back to reality, nothing changed. It was a temporary happiness. I know that therapy might help me but to be honest I don’t want the be treated. It’s not exactly like I don’t want to be healed but I want to leave more. I lost my reason to live. Is it wrong if I can’t handle all of this and just want to disappear instead of getting treated? Because I tried to cope with it my entire life and I have enough of it. I endured it more than 20 years and now I just can’t help but feel like maybe it’s better if I don’t exist.

I’m 16 

I split with my best friend of many years because she had begun physically abusing me and then I told her I thought I was going to kill myself and she blatantly didn’t care. That was the beginning of the end. 

A few months later, she spread rumours all around my school that I lied about a bunch of random shit, the state I was born, my sisters name, my self harm, etc that I didn’t, but no one believes me for some reason, even though it’s so easy for me to disprove to everyone. Everyone is constantly talking so bad about me saying horrible and disgusting things and I couldn’t take it. So I stopped going to school for pretty much the rest of the year. I’ve been suicidal constantly since this, which was in April. 

Then my parents kicked me out but then randomly out of nowhere reported me missing when they found a paper I wrote before. It basically said if I didn’t check on them before the 20th I’m in danger but DO NOT report me missing under my birth name. For context I had my name legally changed and the original name is my most well guarded secret and embarrassment. Not sure why but hearing it makes me wanna seriously kill myself no joke. 

I said in the letter I wouldn’t kill myself so not to worry because they knew about how I’ve been the past few months UNLESS they reported me under my birth name after the 20th. Then guess fucking what they reported me missing despite kicking me out under my fucking birth name. There would be absolutely no reason they’d need to used this name, it’s not my legal name, it’s on none of my IDs. They were telling me to do it. They got me put in police custody and a mental ward, the worst experiences of my life. 

Now I’m getting further and further off the deep end by the day. I’ve started thinking my pets have been replaced by spies and every typing error I’ve made in this I’ve taken as I sign from God to kill myself. I got super worked up before writing this and usually I’d be calm by now but I’m not. 

Tldr everything is fucking horrific and I’m killing myself tonight.

Debating on whether I should go to inpatient ,"I went to inpatient in 2022 and have been suffering still. I’ve gone to therapy, have taken meds and got back on track to have a more “normal” life with a job and stuff. I’ve gained a few friends as well. But on the inside I’m absolutely rotting. Nothing seems to be giving me that extra lift to actually feel normal. 

Inpatient didn’t help long term but it stopped me from killing myself. I’m hesitant, firstly because my suicidal thoughts come in waves, and secondly because I have narcissistic parents who would be absolutely livid if I went back.

Nostalgia from before I was raped 17F,"Tw.Suicide,CSA,Addiction 

I was raped when I was 8 years old. I feel like after that my childhood was over. I don’t know why it still affects me now. It’s been more than half of my life. 

Whenever I see or hear things to do with my life before then I cry. I was so happy when I was a small child. 

I wish things could be that way again. If I was never raped my life would be so different. I wouldn’t be suicidal like I am now. I wouldn’t have grown up so fast. I would be happy. I would probably not have as bad mental health issues. My whole life could have been different. 

I wouldn’t still be having nightmares years later. Unable to keep long lasting friendships and relationships. Depending on drugs and alcohol so I don’t kill myself.

I know I wouldn’t still be laughing and playing barbies and dress up now but I would’ve naturally. Instead of for some reason just stopping after the trauma. 

I want to be that girl again. I don’t want to be an adult. I just want to be 7 years old again before my life was ruined. I want to play all day and watch Peppa pig with my sister who didn’t understand why I wouldn’t play with her anymore at the time. And I want to collect my little pony figures and draw with wash off glitter tattoo pens with my friends. Before they started to turn on me and bully me because I started to become weird after the trauma.

I never would’ve thought I’d turn out this way. No one did. I used to be kind and friendly and have morals. Now I steal all the time and have to be on something to cope all the time and I’m mean to people I care about all the time.
 
It just gets worse and worse. It’s been years and instead of getting better I’ve gotten worse.

she hanged herself in her house. and her dad found her

I'm wordless

i keep thinking why did she do it and not me? why if I didn't do it, she did? and how? how did she find out how to do it? what did she use? what was she thinking when preparing everything, and just before doing it?

i feel envy, confusion, i feel like I should've been the one doing it, i feel like a coward for some reason, i feel as if this happened to our group of friends, i feel as if i did it to my friends
i thought about the many many times my friends were scared about me and what could i do, i think about the moment my dad would found my body if i did it, how guilty he'd feel (i had major issues with my dad but we've been at peace for 3 or 4 years now)

it's horrible, it's a fucking nightmare and I'm so shocked and I don't know what to do with this overwhelming feeling
I couldn't stop crying before writing this

so many people died inbetween yesterday and today... one argentinian guy died just before the match, because he went to the obelisk to cheer, he climbed a thing there and then fell off it... he landed with his head
and then, like 5 or 6 people died after the match too because of fights... and now this

When poverty affects your ability to do what you want in your life,"I simply cannot find a way to (financially) get out of this monthly loop of just having enough to pay rent, taxes etc. In fact I would love to no longer work for someone who doesn't even know who I am ever again. I don't mind working though, I would in fact love to ""work"" physically, hiking up the Alps, biking across an entire country, kayaking through beautiful rivers. I would love work with my hands in my own garden, secluded by the pollutions of modern cities and put in hard work on fixing or adjusting whatever may be needed on my very own house, in a beautiful countryside. All these things however - travelling, fully owning a house in a beautiful area - cost a lot of money. With my lack of talents and understanding of moneymaking I simply cannot see a way to achieve financial independence to experience (live) these things and as such I cannot ever see myself living the (rather simple) life I would love to live, with its occasional travels and the cozy house surrounded by nature. To me, I just see no point in living when I can't even find the path towards that goal. I can't get out of the system so to speak.

  
Edit: I realize the usage of the word 'poverty' may not have been ideal, I have a bed, a roof over my head (for now) and while I can't afford most meat anymore, I can still eat food everyday unlike many (far too many) in the world right now.

I’m doing the world a favour by killing myself,"So an incident at work led to me having a MDD episode. I was off work for 4 months until my claim got approved and got into a treatment program. The program was great. I had a counsellor and a kin. I was doing great. But the depression didn’t go away. Next week is my last week of recovery. I cut myself four days ago after years of not cutting. Suicidal thoughts are back. I don’t know. I feel like since I was 8, I’ve always felt like I’m meant to go crazy. That I’m meant to end my life.

I’m not sure. I’m trying to get back into the workforce and had a couple of interviews. It’s very competitive out there. I feel like especially living in Canada as an immigrant of 10years, I haven’t felt like I belong anywhere. Am I not doing everyone a favour for killing myself? Since one less person to compete against for resources?

I’ve already thought off hanging myself. Maybe hinging a hook on the ceiling and getting a rope? I don’t want my boyfriend to see tho. I just want to stop feeling soooo sad and so so so lonely. 

Thanks for reading. Hope you’re being kind to yourself. ❤️

i just want happiness ,"do you ever think back to a time when you were happy? i do all the fucking time, it hurts so much to exist now

when my mother took care of me and took me everywhere to make me happy

when i had a loving girlfriend who promised me a bright future, a marriage, children, a life worth living and working for

when i was passing school with the highest grades and honors, energy in me to do my best and work to my career

slowly losing everything, watching your life collapse in front of you, and you sit there, with no control, and all you can do is cry

i now take care of my mother who isn’t as well now with constant medications, cries in front of me, and worsens every year

my girlfriend broke up with me 4 months ago (been together for half a decade) because she couldn’t do long distance anymore, told me she doesn’t have enough love for me, and doesn’t want to see me

and now im barely passing college, failed a class, lost a scholarship, and i don’t give a fuck about graduating or any career

i lost everything, i have constant nightmares of my girlfriend leaving me, i loved her more than anything in the world and she meant everything to me, she was my hope to a happier life

i’ve been crying everyday for months, often research suicide and read posts on reddit about them, i tried everything to get better (gym, hang out with friends, hobbies, every fucking thing) and nothing works, i feel worse

im afraid of being alone and i know ill have no one left soon, the only reason why im still here is because i dont want to hurt my mother more than she already is if i were to disappear

sometimes i feel like screaming, i hate that i have no control over my life anymore, i cant do anything, all i can do is sit and wait until i lose the last few people i have left

i wish i could just disappear, i dont wanna cry anymore, i dont wanna have tormenting thoughts anymore, i dont want nightmares anymore, i wish i could be happy

i just wanted to vent, i have no one to tell my feelings and thoughts to, i pretend to be okay, i wish i was happy ",JohnAlks12,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e205p4/i_just_want_happiness/

I struggle with suicidal thoughts but don't feel depressed.,"I've always felt a feeling of depression within myself growing up. Id say I am a happy personality with a sad soul. I never considered it to be depression because I did not have terrible thoughts about myself or feelings of worthlessness until 2020. It slowly increased and In 2021 I experienced a very dark depression and finally understand the true meaning of it. You truly cannot grasp how it feels until you've experience the pain and the thoughts. It's like no matter what you have, do or know, the thoughts and feelings do not falter. I tried so many coping mechanisms to make life better but could not get my mind to heal. I knew I had a desirable life on the outside looking in, and still felt such worthlessness, self hate and did not want to continue living. I contemplated and planned suicide a lot. I'd cry every single day and drown in the misery of waking up again and having to go through more life. It felt as though anything I try to do to make life better, it made it worse. It is such an internal battle. I finally started taking antidepressant during that time period because I started to actively seek out ways to commit suicide and get the means to do so. It healed my mind so much. I finally felt happy again, id speak to my mom and just tell her how happy I feel everyday. I stopped after a while and still felt some depressive symptoms but not as deep and harrowing. I also have ADHD. I changed a lot of aspects of my life and did a lot of reflection and introspection and I do feel better generally in life. I think back at this time and it feels like such a traumatic life event. Just having my brain be so dark. Its an unforgettable feeling and time of my life that changed me so much.

With that being said this past year in 2023 I broke up with a boyfriend of 8 years who cheated and then got into a very traumatic, abusive relationship with a narcissist. A canon event I'd say. The abuse, betrayal and evil I experienced from someone I loved was so extreme and confusing. It left me with no job or home because I had to escape from him and run to a different state for my safety. Ive been struggling to heal from this and find work as well. Reflecting on all of this and the current state of my life leaves me very sad. Rebuilding my self worth as well as being completely alone every day is very saddening after having back to back very codependent relationships. I am very unproductive and sit home every day with barely any social interactions. I know I need hobbies and activities but its hard to find motivation... With that being said I do not feel that depressed. I'm sad often but I would not say I feel those deep depressive feelings that I once struggled so deeply with. I can still find some happiness in my day to day. Before, any inconvenience would send me off the deep end but even with all of this new trauma, I do not feel that way. I don't feel depressed but I often feel like ending my life because the struggle of life, the economy and loneliness is just so unbearable and unenjoyable. No plans or real desire but it's a reocurring thought.

It almost seems like once you feel deep depression and suicidal thoughts, they will always return. Depression kind of feels like a cycle or even like an addiction. Not that you desire it but in a way that you go into periods of remission or sobriety and then those thoughts creep up and you bask in your dark feelings. Its like you try not to relapse and when you feel yourself slipping you have to fight, and it scares you. Or even like a spectrum that you constantly teeter on. Its almost like you can never get rid of the darkness inside of you. Sometimes I think I enjoy feeling deep emotion, whether good or bad. But bad emotions run so deep they sometimes feel intoxicating.... Can anybody relate to this?",Remarkable-Ice-3939,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1ytim/i_struggle_with_suicidal_thoughts_but_dont_feel/
My feelings keep overwhelming me,"I feel so broken inside that nothing seems enough to mend the pieces. I feel like I am the sum of my mistakes, failures, and regrets. Except for a few days, it has been a very long time since I have felt peace. I've carried this heavy heart for as long as I can remember. The depth of my sadness knows no bounds, yet it feels hypocritical, as I have never faced true loss, never had to go hungry, beg, or feel violated. There are so many good things in my life, yet I am unable to be grateful for them. Only when I lose them do I understand how much I care and how much they mean to me. And I always lose them.

I am never able to express my love and affection for the people who stood by me in the darkest times. I fail to treasure them and respect their value. I lie here sad and broken, fully aware that I have hurt people terribly. Though I might not have done it intentionally, I did nothing to stop it. I've made decisions and choices for which there is no one to blame but myself. I have always hurt people, leaving them disappointed and sad. I can't think of one relationship in my life where this hasn't happened. I have hurt myself too, making terrible decisions that led to many mistakes.

I feel like I have not achieved anything in my life. Even now, I am afraid I am indulging in self-pity. This terrible feeling of sadness, guilt, shame, regret, and loneliness just does not seem to go away. And why would it? I have not been a good son, brother, friend, family member, or boyfriend. I have failed both in my personal and professional life. I lie here heartbroken, knowing I have caused so much pain and suffering.

I have hurt someone I truly love, and I don't know how to feel bad, because it is not me who suffered because of my actions. Now, I am alone, having broken all relationships. I don't have a friend to talk to or a girlfriend to share my heart with. The loneliness feels like a huge weight on me, one that I can't shed no matter what I do. I have not treated myself right. I have been undisciplined, inconsistent, and careless about myself, the people in my life, my feelings, and my life. I have chased impulsivity and short-term gratification.

I have not respected others or taken care of them because I have not respected or taken care of myself. Sometimes, I wish I could just fulfill all my responsibilities and make my parents happy, because after that, I might be able to end the suffering completely. Because I cannot take much of this anymore.

I want to look at the ocean again and feel peace. I want to laugh and dance when I feel the rain on my face. I want to enjoy the wonders of the world. I just want to stop feeling so worthless and aimless. I want to become a better person who can contribute meaningfully through his work to the world, and who is able to love and be loved in return.",AfraidAnteater5723,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e46gh3/my_feelings_keep_overwhelming_me/

It's been over a month since I haven't thought about offing myself. I used to subconsciously daydream stuff like a rope tightening around my neck, as it felt liberating, but now I am not having such thoughts since sometime.

I am not keeping up a rigid routine or trying to commit to anything, only trying to keep up the basic hygiene routines like brushing and bathing every day. If I don't feel like doing any other chore of the day, I don't force myself to do it and neither feel bad about myself.

I am trying to be loving and forgiving to myself.

I am also planning to slowly commit to people. 

I hope I keep this up.

I do not worry much either.

I wish no one loses their hope.

Its all okay, whatever you are feeling is valid. If u dont like anything, that is okay. If you are tired to get out of bed, that's okay. Everything is okay. Try to love yourself a bit. Even if that's not possible, it's okay.

can i do anything if my ex says she doesnt have feelings for me anymore but i want a second chance,"ok so, for a little backstory i (17M) have mild autism, and me and my ex (17F) were dating for about 4 months but they were the best 4 months of my life, i had known her for about 5 years through secondary, and had a crush on her for 3-4 years while she was in another relationship and apparently she liked me back, i had written songs about her and had a special song which reminded me of her (looking out for you - joy again). simply put, we had a lot of history. in our relationship, she made me feel happiness like ive never felt before but she broke up with me just over a week ago and we talked for the following few days then went no contact, leaving on good terms. today i reached out to her just to acknowledge the breakup, not to beg or anything like that i simply just wanted to talk to her as friends.


we got onto the topic of the breakup and she seemed reluctant to talk about it which i kinda get and she even said ""You can text me about anything that you want to just not the break up"". this is roughly how the convo went:

me: ""hi""

her: ""hi?""

i asked her how shes been and then i said:

me: ""i just wanted to say i want you to be happy thats all i want, i just honestly wish i did better as a boyfriend for you because you deserve it""

her: ""You’ve said before [...] You don’t seem ok""

me: ""i know but its natural [...] its just ive been thinking a lot about our relationship and issues that could be solved but i understand we need space and i dont want to push anything onto you i just wanted to be completely transparent with you that i still love you and i still care""

her: ""Thank you""

and i asked a question i probably shouldnt have. i asked:

""do you still have feelings for me"" 

and i got:

""Stop trying to hurt yourself""

but i pushed and told her itd help me move on, and she said:

""No I don’t [...] If I still had feelings for you I would still be with you""

that shot a cold sharp pain through my heart but now i guess i just feel numb. i know i messed up and did stuff wrong i understand that now but its too late to change it, i just want her back. i felt like me and her had something really special. and i dont know how long ill be lonely again for and im afraid of never feeling love like it again, but my friend stated maybe i feel like this because she gave me my first taster of what a good relationship is like, and i seek validation and happiness from her because of this as well as me liking her for so long and she liked me back, and our history and how special the relationship felt. which is maybe why i dont want it to go away.

anyways, when i told her she made me really happy in the relationship she replied with:

"" It never felt like I made you happy ever [...] How did you think that made me feel""

i feel like i expressed my happiness all the time around but i guess she didnt feel the same. i replied with:

""awful, and for that im truly sorry""

everything just sucks, i wish i had appreciated her more and been more grateful for her company because now shes gone shes all i want. i know i screwed up but my friends seem to think im putting too much of the blame on myself.


another thing that has given me mixed signals is that she is really open and happy to talk about anything other than the breakup, like she will carry convos and stuff if it isnt about us separating but is extremely dry if anything about our breakup is mentioned. also, the day we broke up which was a thursday, (tmi) she was sending me sexual messages and i was reciprocating, but then she went and met her friend and about an hour later i received a breakup message. for the last day or so before this we didnt message much but i thought that was because we had just spent 3 days straight together catsitting, and we probably needed some time away from each other im not sure. anyways, the sexual messages to a breakup text seemed to me like a drastic change and when i asked how long she'd been feeling like this she said:

""since monday"" (when we started catsitting, which to me doesnt seem like a lot of time to rethink an entire relationship but i will respect her ultimate decision)

and when i asked for some reasons because there wasnt really any in the breakup text i got (and im paraphrasing):

she needed to focus on herself
she felt like she didnt see me as much as she wanted to (im in college to do a-levels, go to the gym and work but i saw her as often as i could)
she needed to focus on her mental health
she felt we werent on the same page anymore and to be fair we didnt have many mutual interests but that didnt bother me
she thought it was for the best


i picked up my stuff the next day, friday, and we talked for about an hour in my car, i promised myself i wouldnt cry or anything but i couldnt stop myself. she comforted me which was nice and like i said we went to sit in my car to talk stuff out. we talked like we were still in a relationship, she even called me ""babe"" twice on accident. she sorta gave me hope by saying she might regret it and sorta hinted at the possibility of getting back together once she worked on herself but told me not to wait for her. however, her friend (the one she was with when she sent the breakup text) had also recently broken up with her boyfriend (coincidentally one of my friends) and she sorta gave him hope and the half-promise of getting back together, yet is now going on a date with another guy currently and its broke my friends heart. anyways, and before she left my car after we talked for that hour she sorta lingered for a bit, like she wanted to say something or she wanted me to say something, so i just asked her if she wanted one final kiss and she agreed and we kissed and said ""i love you"" one final time and we agreed we'd miss each other.

i forgot about some photos of me and her i had ordered and they arrived on monday, i asked her if she wanted them back and she said:

""oh shit i forgot about those. no i dont want them""

another thing is that i work with her mother and her auntie, and her mother is absolutely lovely she gave me a hug and asked how i was doing because we both really liked each other. we just chatted for a bit and i guess agreed it wasnt meant to be, and i thanked her for always making me feel welcome in her home and in her family. she said im welcome anytime and that my ex still cares about me just i guess we werent meant to be. her mother told me that im a lovely boy and she joked that she wished i had a good influence on my ex, and i joked back saying i tried.

also, one last thing i promise, she and her ex went together for 3 years, and broke up and got back together multiple times and he was honestly an awful human being. so why does she hate the chance of a retry with me when (not trying to sound narcissistic or anything) i was so much better to her than he was.


anyways, enough ranting. i feel numb currently but i know its going to hit me like a truck later and ill be miserable. i was thinking maybe i could call her and ask if she wants to go on a walk sometime as friends and maybe we could rekindle something then as i truly believe if she just gives me a second chance we can truly change things and i can be the best boyfriend to her.

i dont know though, i want to respect her decisions and if thats without me i guess i must accept it and try my hardest to move on. but i feel awful. the thought of her with another man hurts me so much, i just want to show her i can be a better person.

any advice would be greatly appreciated, thank you very much for your time.",_expendable,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4mifg/can_i_do_anything_if_my_ex_says_she_doesnt_have/

Too cowardly to commit suicide ,"The whole day today I've been thinking about the fact that I am dirt poor. Literally. But I live in Lesotho so it's no surprise. I had a bursary to go study in a university in South Africa but I couldn't afford to go because it only covered tuition and not accommodation, and even if I did find accommodation I definitely wouldn't afford to get a visa. ""Why don't you just study in Lesotho?"" I simply can't afford to, I can't even afford to buy data bundles most of the time and it's just R20 for 800mb weekly. My family hasn't had access to tap water for three months now because we couldn't afford to pay the bill until the water company cut us off. We don't even have indoor plumbing!! We're still using a pit latrine. I don't think I'd have any education at all if primary education in government funded schools wasn't free. Going to sleep hungry is not a big deal anymore, I've even stopped feeling hunger at this point. My siblings have left this poverty behind, one by one they made it out and never looked back. Still waiting for my breakthrough. I am lowkey suicidal, I wanna die but I am too chicken to actually do it, but I definitely wouldn't mind it if I woke up dead. I've thought of throwing myself in front of a moving truck countless time but I don't want to to traumatize someone else. When I hear of someone who committed suicide I simply admire their bravery lol. And the sad reality is, in this country if you were born poor the odds are already stacked against you and you will most likely die poor.

I am trying to get on disability because I can’t work cause of this. Everyone that has been in my life got what they wanted out of me then moved on. The whole world and everyone in it has passed me by. I quit alcohol and weed and that has just made things worse with my mental health. I have lashed out at people who left me and have guilt and shame because of it. I try to love myself because I know that’s the key but I just can’t.

It's over for me,"My mental health has been declining for the past two years. I've sought out therapy and medication, but I've reached the conclusion that it doesn't work for me. A few years ago I tried Wellbutrin, and it did absolutely nothing for me. I've moved on to Sertraline and Strattera. It's probably just the Strattera, but it destroyed my entire personality. I just stopped taking them a few weeks ago. Yeah, I know I needed to fucking taper them. I just couldn't stand feeling like a robot anymore.

I've talked to therapists and psychiatrists, but I lie to them about how bad things are. I've heard them sound disappointed when I tell them that I'm ""passively suicidal"". I cant tell them the truth. I don't see how institutionalizing me is going to make my life any better. I'll lose my job, then without a job, the bank will foreclose on my house. I'll jump off a fucking building if that happens.  
  
A few weeks ago, for the first time, I mentioned how I was feeling to my friend. You know what I was met with? Dismissal and judgement. 15 years of my god damned life spent building a friendship with her and she cant even be fucked to carry on a text conversation. The amount of hours I've talked about and remained actively engaged in her life, but she can't even conjure up two texts. I'm sure that once she decides to start talking to me again and when she pretends that I never said anything, I'll forgive her. It's because I'm a spineless piece of shit.

I pour everything I have into other people. No one pours anything back into me. No one has ever empathized with me. It doesn't matter the situation or circumstance, everything is always my fault. I'm a utility pole and once I'm out of utility to give, everyone will abandon me. Perhaps it's for the best. It will make ending things a whole lot easier. No one will miss me and it'll be easier knowing all vestiges of hope are gone.

I'm so fucking lonely. I'm almost 30. I've never had a meaningful girlfriend/partner. I always wanted someone to build a life with. Now, I'm almost """"complete"""". I have a career, house, car, hobbies, etc. However those things don't bring you happiness. I would absolutely throw it all away for a laptop and a dank efficiency apartment if I could just have someone in my life.

Oh yeah, did I mention that I also have type 1 diabetes? I eat some fucking crackers and my god damned blood sugar goes insane. Oh, you want to wake up and have a normal morning? Not for me! Let's go from 75 to 400 for no fucking reason! Then I can go to my endocrinologist to tell me how much of a fuckup I am and how fucked my future is.

Is he going to recreate what he saw? Am I a bad influence on him?

I thought I would get better with a purpose in life but I can’t,"I’m using a throwaway because if anyone found out about this I would lose my career and it’s the only thing I have that I care about. 
I tried to kill myself when I was in college years ago and ended up in a hospital. I was medicated for a few years and when I was off meds I decided to try and actually do something to warrant my existence. 
I won’t give many details but I became a commissioned officer and went through a particularly selective process for the specific job in the military that I have and I thought being a leader and having people to look after and make better would help me get better but it hasn’t.

All of my friends have girlfriends, fiances, families that love them and things like that and I thought maybe those things would come by being successful and in shape and all that but it hasn’t and I just have nothing but my work. 
I love the men that I lead and would do anything for them and I just don’t want to live anymore but I owe it to them to live and I just wish I could die and they would be okay. 
My friend with a fiance and loving family and friends saw how I interact with my platoon and said he was depressed because he doesn’t get that sort of relationship from his job. I take a ton of pride in being a leader that has reliably led my boys through hardships and the happiest I am is when they show and say that they value me, but I have nothing outside of work.

I’m a successful, in shape, educated person and I’m always the one rejected even by people who have nothing to offer but just paying attention to me. If anyone knew I want to kill myself I would lose my command and those boys are the only thing I actually care about in this life and then I’d have no choice.

Everything in this world is a fucking joke and its affecting me in the worst way possible. I have descended into this state of being cold... I've become a cold hearted, emotionless husk that can only operate at work. Once I'm at home all i do is sit, game, eat or fantasize about a better life that is so out of reach. The feeling of daily paralysis and not being happy or content even existing is tiring. Sleep is too hard these days too. iv been awake for days just thinking. Not being able to feel emotion and feeling like there's nothing to do anymore in life but to work is just shit. Its cost me friends and is about to cost me my marriage.

Outside my 4 walls that i call home, i am continuously met with a society that cannot seem to accept one another. My very religious family is always out there to condemn every choice i ever make or have made in the past. Society is always trying to convert other people to their belief system whether that is religion, gender, political, socio-economical or even food related and the pressure of being confronted by that is just over exaggerated. Now don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their own choices regarding beliefs or gender identification but just stop laying it so thick on people especially people like me. i have had to deal enough with mental pressure/manipulation in my teenage years and now that i am almost 30 i have to continue battling my way through more mental pressure because other people cant handle the way you live your life? Absurd!

Passively suicidal,"I dont feel like i deserve the gift of life . Basically, i got with this girl, which was my my mates ex, breaking bro code. I did so bc of a mixture of loving her as a person, greed for my own self, and the fact i felt sorry for her as his ex allgedly violated her(not true and it fucked me over, you'll find out soon). It was smooth sailing for the first week, chill, no drama, but since the group found out abt us being together, they aint happy. As a result I pressured her to let me expose him of his alleged crime to the group. They called cap, kicked us out. She got very upset, so much so that on our date, i had to stop her from scratching herself (self-harm) because of it. I thought i was in the right all this time, even kids helpline said it was violation. Keep in mind she has past trauma, and she had not been shaking and being this stressed since it. 

She then called the cops and they said it wasn't S/A, for a valid reason which both of us had overlooked. We then apologised to the group, and she left me on her own accord, which i accepted. Not only have i caused her to legit stress about this, making her want to disappear (she is moving schools bc of this), but ive almost caused the mate i stole her girl from to commit suicide, as i yelled at him with not very nice language abt this when confronting him, threatening to blackmail him and mentally tortured him. Sure the last bit was my fault; the group hates me and her now. I feel that it was all 100% my fault, even though i was only trying to pass the message on. Ive caused her and her ex emotional damages beyond my comprehension. 

Ive had a panic attack about this too. This is not the only incident i have hurt people, as i used violence alot, bullied, and was an overall dick to alot of people last year. I thought this one i was gonna change, but ive only repeated my mistakes, and my reputation at school was already bad enough, but now i'd rather rot at home and learn nothing than have to deal with all this.

Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.  Please report everything of the nature that you see.",SQLwitch,43,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pl9suy/please_remember_that_no_activism_of_any_kind_is/

I’m going into college this August and idk if it’s worth it to go anymore, I feel like I am unworthy of love and I hate myself so much. I’ve never had a relationship and I have no real friends. 

I have a twin sister (I’m also a girl) and we’ve pretty much had the same friends growing up. Back then I thought it was annoying because I hated being paired up with her but now I feel like a burden to her. I know she thinks I’m a loser with no friends (true) and she feels obligated to hang out with me bc of our parents. Throughout high school, I hung out with her and her friends and pretty much just faded into the background. Not a single person was actually friends with me because of me- they only hang out with me because of her.

Genuinely (and I’m not delusional) nobody cares about me; not a single person. I feel worthless and dumb and ugly and unlovable. 

I know everybody is going to say “you’ll meet your true friends in college” but I genuinely feel like I am incapable of making friends. I feel like the more people know about me the closer I’ve pushed them down the inevitable timeline of when they’ll eventually leave me.

Depression and the feeling of being numb…,"I don’t post normally but I need a way to get my feelings out other than say Facebook or things such as that. 

Here’s my story…. Grab a seat and a snack and be ready for this. None of it is good. 

I’ve been dealing with mental health all my life. I was 5 when I was diagnosed with bipolar, adhd, autism, anger issues and disgraphia. I’ve been living a shadow of a life ever since. 

My family wanted me to get counseling because of my several attempts of killing myself or saying I would as a kid. I’ve white knuckled my way through life. I’m 23 now and I don’t look like it nor do I act like it. I’m old for someone my age. 

For instance I like jazz and things most people my age don’t. 
Just out of place. 

Depression didn’t really start until I got a little older. It was after high school when I really started to notice that I just don’t care anymore. Living off of impulse and do what I want. Screw everyone else. I’m just so tired of doing that all the time. I’ve been put on medication that almost killed me several times. I’ve had to change psychiatrists several times because of this. 

I know I’m not the only one but I’m definitely one of a few. I’m out of place and out of time. I don’t want to kill myself but I’m not opposed to anything or anyone doing it. I’m just done with everything you know? 

I can’t talk to my family anymore about it. I live in my own and have burned all the bridges in my family. I’ve had what most have not. Help. And I just threw it away because it wasn’t the help that I needed. 

Here is a little context for you. 

When I was 3 my mother and father got divorced. Ever since I’ve been under the same conclusion. It’s my fault. Because I’m different than my entire family. 
My grandfather who was like a father to me, passed away november 22 2018. I graduated 2019. I’ve never felt more defeated in all my life until he was taken from me. I’ve always had a want to help others. After he died, so did I… I’m not ok in the slightest and I know that. But what is stupid is that I’m comfortable in my depression but at the same time I’m tired of it. The main reason I don’t change is because I’m numb. 
It’s not a matter of not wanting to, it’s a matter of feeling worthless and unwanted but at the same time loved and wanted. These are mixed signals as clear as the sky is blue. 
This has been an issue since I was little. 

I’m different and I don’t trust anyone anymore. I’m just fed up of trying. 

I’m also flirtatious by nature. I try not to be but my mouth gets me into trouble. I tell my self one thing and do the opposite. I’ve lost several jobs this way. I want to go mute because of this. 

I’ve host lost all hope by this point that I can change and that I should even try. Maybe this is my fate to be the super villain of my story. I don’t know. I just don’t know… I’m not even tired anymore. I just don’t care and don’t want to do anything. I’ve just lost my will and want to live because what’s the point. My family and friends all tell me I have this great potential but I’ve never seen it myself. I won’t kill my self but if someone else does it, by all means go for it. I know my family and friends love me but I don’t love myself. I’ve hated myself since the day I learned the word.

I'm depressed for no reason ,"I am 37 and since the age of 10, I feel depressed. It has reached the extent of me increasingly having suicidal thoughts. Sadly all the ""you are loved"", ""it gets better"", therapy, antidepressants, do not work for me in the long run.

I even have plans for the future but I feel like I'm just forcing myself. Inside of me, I just want to end my life and stop the pain. I feel bad because I know some people have it way worse than me but still have the will to live and keep going with a smile on their face. I have told my girlfriend about it in the past but I minimized it because I don't want to be a burden to her. I told her because I couldn't hide it anymore and cried in front of her for no apparent reason, so had to explain. Nobody wants to be around a depressed person.

Abusive household destroyed my life beyond repair,"For my entire life, my mother has been physically/mentally abusing me 24/7 due to, I think, having a stressful work, I know sometimes I don't help, for example having bad grades(due do ADHD), but what she did to me created an people-pleaser, who constantly pushes away people with zero confidenze man, will never forget how she constantly says it was better for me not to born at all, or when she asks me what wrong did she do to the world to give me birth, or when she says nobody will ever like me and I'll die miserably.

I want her, i want her in my life but she has a boyfriend and that kills me everytime. I'm gonna see them kissing and hugging hand have a great time, while i got no one that loves me romantically. Then im gonna go home with the realization that she is being fucked by this guy while i try to sleep but cant.

I failed my work, i failed my university because i don't wanna do shit in my life. No girl ever wanted me and im a failure socially.

All I'm gonna see is fucking happy people living their life while im rotting inside full of sadness and hate. I just want to die, take my father grenade, go to the forest with my car, leave it there and blow my head. No pain, and all problems solved.

Fuck this im out, i wanna go out, in tired and fucking hateful all the time and seeing people live, while im 21 and i never lived one day in my life makes me really want to go out.

Spiritually abused in jail,"Laying on my bunk in the Brevard County jail the man in the bunk next to me started eating chips. I could hear him munching on them as I lay there trying to sleep. He starts laughing to himself quietly as he's doing this, and while I hear this happening, a strange feeling starts to overcome my body as it seems to slowly go from my ear towards the lower half of my body jewels.

It was at this time I started to have intrusive thoughts about offensive things that disturb and anger me. I'm not sure if this was some kind of ritual or what, but it seemed like some dark magic was being performed at that time. I was confused as I didn't know things like this were possible, I just lay there not confronting the man.

It has been 10 years since that happened (around 8/14/2014 - 9/15/2014) and it is still ongoing. This phenomena is truly ruining my life and I'm not sure how to proceed. This happened in Florida.

I am scared it will never get better,"I (23F) have struggled with anxiety and depression for what feels like my entire life. However, I am scared it will never get better. Every time it starts to feel like it is getting better, something shifts in my brain or something happens that triggers my 'symptoms' again. I am really struggling.

I feel ungrateful and hate myself for the fact that I struggle. Don't get me wrong, I am not super well off. I am a first generation university student who is barely scraping by on the little money I get but I still know that some people would kill to be where I am.

Just today, I got flown out to a different city by a big law firm for vacation work. They are paying my flights, accommodation and meals for an entire week. Still, I can't feel better and I try. I really do. I try to remind myself that everything is okay and that I should enjoy myself and this wonderful experience. I can't. Something in my brain feels wrong and I feel like it is seeping out of me in a very noticeable way. Most of the other students here kind of look at me like I am a joke and I feel like its because they can notice how sick I feel on the inside.

I don't know. None of this makes sense. I am sorry, my brain isn't functioning very well.

I just need to know that I am not alone. ",Holiday-Elderberry98,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e41c18/i_am_scared_it_will_never_get_better/
I’m so close to giving up,"I’m actually trying to make something of myself. I’m a housewife (cue all the men telling me I’m worthless yes I know thanks I won’t be alive hopefully soon so you won’t have to worry about humbling me-even though I’m clearly not full of myself).

Got married, went active duty military, then got out. Struggled to get my head on straight for years, got therapy, meds, thought I was making great progress until recently.

Finally I was on track for a degree and a pathway to a field I’m interested in. Until I found out me from high school apparently fucked over me today. Gpa and act score isn’t high enough for the program I want to get into so now what??  Idk I’ve had setbacks before but this just sent me over the edge. And it’s not like I picked my major mindlessly this was my third time for this era of my life and after so much damn research. After all the research and planning and my dad and grandma talking shit behind my back about me needing a job and not just wasting my life just being a wife now what?

It’s like no matter what plan I create for myself the universe tells me to fuck off. I’m so over life it’s not even funny at this point. Maybe to those who predicted I would never amount to crap. 

I’m genuinely fucking trying and it doesn’t even matter

No I don’t need a random job to take my mind off things I don’t even have to work. I want to have a career. There’s only 1 car here so I’m stranded anyway. The issue lies with whatever path I choose, I get shoo’d away in one way or another. It’s like the universe is trying to force me to do something I have no interest doing.

Dépressif ou déprimé ?,"Tout d’abord désolé si il y a des erreurs mais c’est mon premier post. J’ai 19 ans et depuis le collège j’ai toujours eu une sorte de mal être en moi. J’ai fini par accepter qu’à ce moment là je me donnais cette image de moi car je trouvais ça un peu ""stylé"". Mais bon j’avais déjà le sentiment de vivre pour autrui (mes parents) et non à 100% pour moi-même. Ma période lycée on va dire que ça s’est accentué, c’était plus juste pour les caméras. J’ai vécu une longue relation dans laquelle j’me considérais heureux mais j’étais totalement tombé dans de la dépendance affective. (Avec du recul les moments où je me sens épanouis ne dépendent pas vraiment de moi mes des autres). Mon bonheur dépendait énormément de ses actions, pensées ou encore sa présence. A cette période je me sentais déjà très seul. J’avais certes des potes mais très peu que je considérais comme grand ami. Au côté de ce groupe de pote je me sentais seul en étant accompagné et même si ça va un peu mieux aujourd’hui je ne me suis pas vraiment fait d’autres potes depuis. Il y avait beaucoup de moments où je parlais sans être écouté/entendu malgré mes efforts. Pour d’autres raisons également j’avais décidé de concentrer toute mon attention envers ma copine de l’époque qui a fini par me quitter il y a 1 an. J’ai donc ressenti l’impression d’avoir perdu à la fois ma copine, ma meilleure amie et tout mon entourage non familial. Cette année fut témoin d’une énorme remise en question et réflexion sur moi même. Je ne me suis jamais senti seul et triste de toute ma vie. Pourtant il y a pire j’ai une famille, des personnes sur qui compter, je peux manger à ma faim mais je ne sais pas il manque un truc. J’ai également 0 but dans la vie, je ne sais pas quoi faire comme métier et j’ai vraiment peur du futur car je m’intéresse à très peu de choses. J’ai d’ailleurs tendances à trop vouloir rester dans ma zone de conforts. Par exemple pour jouer ou regarder des films ou séries je préfère souvent revoir ou rejouer aux mêmes jeux/films. Depuis mon enfance je crains énormément la mort de mes parents car je sais que ce sera peut être le début de la fin pour moi. C’est d’ailleurs la seule raison concrète qui me déchire et me fait pleurer de temps à autre. Récemment j’ai vécu un peu + d’1 mois en étant dans un vrai mood Good vibe mais je sens clairement une rechute depuis plusieurs jours. Pourtant je suis dans une période où je ne suis jamais sorti autant avec des potes si fréquemment de toute ma vie. Après une fois chez moi je passe plus de 80% du temps dans mon lit sur mon phone.
Un truc qui me fait remettre en question mon état est le fait que j’ai beaucoup + souvent envie de disparaître et non de mourir. Car je sais qu’il y a quand même des bons moments à passer et mourir entraînerait la tristesse de mon entourage et que j’aurai des regrets. Je n’ai jamais fait de TS, scarification ou autres. Les seuls trucs ""bêtes"" de ce genre que j’ai fait sont de boire ou fumer comme un golmon en soirée.
En bref j’aimerai savoir si je vis une dépression ou si je suis déprimé. J’ai déjà vu un psy et infirmiers mais cela ne s’est pas bien passé car c’était tout le temps moi qui parlait et n’avait aucune réponse à mes questions. Pour vous aiguiller voici les symptômes que j’ai + ou - selon les périodes : 

-Tristesse
-Solitude/Isolement volontaire ou non 
-Petit ou fort appétit 
-Fatigue quotidienne
-Mauvais rythme et peu de sommeil
-Idées suicidaires
-Peur et désespoirs de l’avenir 
-Fort pessimisme 
-Problèmes de concentrations et d’attentions
-Manque de confiance en soi
-Perte ou peu d’intérêts pour les choses
-Addictions aux écrans
-Je garde de + en + mes problèmes pour moi
-Très peu de motivation et jemenfoutisme",Farfox_62,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1yg1j/dépressif_ou_déprimé/
