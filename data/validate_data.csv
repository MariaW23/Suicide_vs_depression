I've been drawing for 4 years constantly trying to improve, all of that to waste. a lot of other depressing things happened and now i feel horrible  The thing i loved to do most was worthless.  my parents also did other traumatic things the day they said that, and i wont get into that.",0

"It goes fast, and it’s down deep in a little ravine. They’ll probably want to look for me, but it’s for the best. I’m just a lifesucking leech who drains everyone close to them. Every police call is my fault for being weak. My sisters depression is my fault for her having to protect me. It’s for the better.

"For years my brain has felt like there’s a radio dial being turned, cycling through anxious thoughts rapidly overlapping each other and never being able to quiet my mind. Everything is something to be worried about. I’ve never really been happy but now I really feel suicide would be such a relief from the constant stream of bad thoughts I don’t want to have, and I’d finally have peace. My relationship, work, everything suffers, just wanting someone to listen. Thanks.  ",0
"I just want it all to stop. I just want one day where I don’t have any negative thoughts in my head. I just want to have a normal day. But there is no normal for me. There really hasn’t been since that day I was born. A spiral of misfortunes. The thoughts of stabbing myself keep playing in me head. The thoughts of walking into traffic has come back full force. I don’t know what to do. Nothing is going to help because I’m stuck in this stupid body of mine. No matter how much I wish this life wasn’t real, I’m stuck here. I’m just tired of the constant pain that I’m in. I keep looking up easiest ways to kill myself. I already know where I could get pills to swallow. And I already know where bridges are that I could jump off of. I’m easily replaceable, so it really doesn’t matter if I vanish. I don’t have my dog anymore because he passed away. So what’s the point for me to really live for? I have nothing. Never really had anything and never will gain anything. ",0

"I don't really have a reason to live anymore, I just wanna die so that the mental agony stops. I have OCD and get intrusive thoughts about ending myself. I stay up all night praying that I don't commit. Going to the hospital would make me want to die even more, that place is living hell. I already went once and they don't give a damn. Neither do my parents or any other adult figure. I resent everyone, and I hate people so much, why is everyone so terrible? My family is always arguing and I can't escape it. I go into this state of agonizing hopelessness, because I don't know if im going to make it. If something goes wrong later in life, im worried that I won't have the strength to keep going. At this point is a therapist even worth it? I'm lost and have no idea what to do while the world is burning down to the ground. What path do I take from here? ",0
"I wear the same clothes for longer and working from home allows me to get away with it. I haven't showered for four weeks,  only being in a swimming pool at weekends with the kids.

I'll also not shave for much longer.I wonder if there's anyone else like me",0
"I was bullied for being Asian five years ago, and I still struggle with the trauma. I remember being called names like chxngchxng and told to go back to your country. I did have some friends who liked kpop but they sometimes looked down on me and my country. When I confided in them about the struggles, they said I was being too sensitive. It was kind of obvious since I was the only asian but still.. I became paranoid thinking everyone's a racist and cut ties with everyone i knew, even those from my own country. I cut myself and tried to commit suicide so my parents decided to move to canada. Even in canada I was too scared to make new friends, even asian ones. I've been on medication since i came here but it hasn't helped. My concentration has suffered due to depression, affecting my studies. I was supposed to graduate this year but need an extra year. My parents want me to go to university, but I'm not sure if I can handle it. I'm also afraid of being surrounded by foreigners. Returning to my country isn't an option because I don't speak the language fluently.I hate how I keep complain without making any effort. I know I need to try but I lack in motivation to improve my life. I just want it all to end. Is there any way I can find motivation?",0
"hello haha i never imagined myself downloading reddit and even posting something here but here I am. Idk how this works. I don't even know if people would notice my post but here's my story (bare with me bcs hindi ako marunong magkwento)Incoming fourth year college na sana ako, but there's this one prof from last sem which really frustrated the whole class and the other section. He's known sa paghihingi ng money in disguise as a donation daw kapalit ng grades.I was on his good side, ako yung minemessage sa mga classes namin last sem and kung may mga tanong siya. One night, during summer break na 'to around 9pm, he asked for my whereabouts and even called na hindi ko sinagot due to uncomfort kasi nga late na. I politely replied parin and then he told me about a class meeting daw sa isang park malayo sa school. The place and time of the meeting is inconvenient sa commuters kasi wala ng mga dorm dahil nga summer break. I forwarded the message on our class gc and I jokingly labeled him ""gagi, pisti, and kalamri"".Someone snitched me and sent my message to him and he threatened to press charges. I kept on asking apology to him but he insists na magkakaso siya and ipapa-expel ako and there's a possibility daw na makareceive ako ng warrant. I was so anxious that I couldn't eat and sleep. I've been harming myself na rin which was my usual coping mechanism  I met him ulit and handed him my personal apology letter kasama ang ilang classmates but then, sa korte na daw ako magpaliwanag. Before ending that meeting, he told me to meet him alone and I did out of so much fear. On that meeting, he asked me to give him 10,000 which he claimed to be the lawyers fee daw na ibinayad niya, if maibalik ko daw yun, he will ask his lawyer to file a motion to wash the case. He doesn't want me to let my parents know about it and not even my closest friends.I am not really good at handing situations and feeling ko, walang solution sa problem ko. I've been wanting to kill myself dahil hindi ko na rin kinakaya yung thoughts ko and the heavy feeling in my chest. Breathing for me is extremely uncomfortable. Sana hindi nalang ako magising. ",0
"It is getting really hard to resist killing myself. Basically the only thing stopping me is the pain it will inflict literally on myself and the pain it will inflict on my family and friends, although that too is slowly not becoming a problem in my psyche.I had a girlfriend for almost a year. We had been friends ever since we met in 7th grade and I had loved her, or felt like it, practically since I met her. We dated once before our freshman year, but I broke it off due to some personal issues I had. We didn't talk much but were still friendly until our senior year, where we became closer again. Her boyfriend cheated on her near the end of our senior year and a couple months later I asked her out, and we were a really happy couple with a great summer full of memories (ish I will explain later). The problem came when we had to go to separate schools for college, over 3 hours away from one another. To make a very long story short, she found somebody else at her school after we had grown apart emotionally due to an argument we had over having kids (which had us mention breaking up), and she became very close with this guy during April and broke up with me because she didn't want to hurt me any longer by dragging me along in the emotional turmoil. It really, really hurt me and I still have not recovered from it at all. But this is not even the main problem in why I am wanting to escape.My main problem in life or with life is that I have practically no memories. I can't remember what growing up was like very well, I know it just happened. I know I did well in school but I can't remember my classes at all and only a select few of my teachers' faces and names. I can't remember family vacations at all, what we did or when they happened, even when I am shown pictures. I know my friends exist but it would be hard for me to describe their features or interests to someone, and I honestly can't remember any of the times we hung out except for the two that occurred in the past year, but there were obviously more than that. I do not want to keep living like this. There is no value any doing anything if I'm not even going to remember it. It's hard for me to recall what I did most days, even the next day it's hard for me which I don't think is normal. I can't resist wanting and wishing I could live in the past again either. I do feel like I was much happier back then - I really loved school, it was predictable and simple and there was time to socialize with people without it seeming forced. I just have no interests now and I can't even remember what my interests were when I was a kid. Any time I do try and get myself out of this mental slump it just feels so fake because I know how unhappy I am and how badly I just want it to end. Life's possible experiences have no meaning on me when I know I'm probably not going to remember them. Someone please give me advice or something. I am really trying to want to be here but it just seems so pointless. ",1
I wanted to say this because this news was fairly recent i play a lot of golf recently in the past couple months he committed suicide he was a two time winner on the pga tour which is the top tour for those that don't know and he struggled with alcohol addiction and depression its in my heart because those are the two things that i relate to and it makes me sad to see with someone with that much fame and money its not the thing that solves or beats depression may his soul rest in piece Greyson Murray,0

"I met him when I was 19 and he was 24 I think, he was my first boyfriend so I was new to the whole relationship thing. second time we hung out he introduced me to his girl best-friend, little did I know this whole time he was manipulating me into being in some kind of three way relationship that I did not want but because I loved him so much I tried to be okay with it and we had threesomes all the time. At some point it wasn’t fun anymore because I could tell the girl wanted my boyfriend and me out of the picture. My boyfriend did not do anything about it. after that it started being really hard for me to have sex with him because I felt so insecure and unwanted and I had so much anxiety that my body rejected him. It hurt so much while having sex with him I was dry, bleeding, there was cuts and I had recurring yeast infections. Even tho all of that was happening he was still having sex with me which made me bleed even worse (worst pain in my life) I was crying in front of him and he never seemed to notice. I was stupid for not having and boundaries I just wanted him to choose me and love me since I knew sex was so important for him. now they are in a relationship together and it makes me so disgusted and depressed how come I’m here still suffering from the r** my body doesn’t work anymore like it used to I feel like at this point I should just kms. The universe hates me all I wanted was true love but I’ve been lonely for 4-5 years now and nothing seems to get better. I feel like a broken doll that no one will ever love ",0

"I know this is going to be a long read but I hope someone takes their time to read it and provide advice for me I've been depressed and suicidal for a very long time but really want to turn things around. I'm 26, got diagnosed with BPD and I have depression and general anxiety. I was a happy normal kid until 13 when my mom(who has mental issues of her own, daily panic attacks as long as I remember, childlike behaviour even at her 50s now) cheated on my dad and I got involved pretty badly, abuse and threats from both mom and cheater guy then my dad found out his mental went all bad since then he's been horrible to everyone and they are still together now altho divorced so anyways my relationship with my parents and sister are very very bad, they ignore my suicidal behaviours and blame my dysfunctional lifestyle on laziness although it's been pretty clear what they did to me fucked my brain up to a point even after 13 years I can't feel normal. They ask me why I'm being the way I am and as soon as I start talking about what happened back then my dad responds with "" I suffered the most i moved on why can't you "" mind you he was 35 and I was 13 at the time he doesn't understand what trauma can do to an undeveloped brain even after my therapist explained it to him. So yeah this is my story so far and why I'm here is cus I really wanna start living one day at a time, not let my perfectionist black and white thinking patterns not ruin my potential, stop emotional eating and physically undo the damage I've done in the last 13 years and also really really need advice on dealing with impulsivity. I'm planning to go to a library tomorrow and get sources on all of these topics and more and if you have advice or a source that can help me with this stuff I'd really appreciate it. Some days I feel like I feel every second it passes like tomorrow won't come altho I know it always will unless I die so that's why I wanna start living one day at a time so I don't just lay in my bed and let my mind go all over the places. I really do think life is supposed to mean something not just counting the days till it is over. ",0

"I'd like to apologize in advance as this post is just me wallowing in self-pity.I don't know how to start this. I can't focus, I mess things up, talking to me probably feels like talking to a wall. I hate myself for even thinking at one point that the whole world against me, when I don't. I hate myself even more that some people don't seem to think that way. I'm too quiet, too passive, can't stand up for myself. I hate myself for keeping bottling my feelings and keeping things to myself. I don't know how to act when being comforted and I don't know what to do when comforting someone. I'm a bad daughter for not providing comfort to my mother who obviously just cried. It hurts me that my brother knows that she had always cried ever since dad died and this is the first time I see it.I'm a bad sister for being sa choosy, lazy and spoiled.I'm a bad friend for thinking the worst about my only friends. For crying and going to them during a emotional breakdown when they probably have it worse and not expecting that out of me. And I'm scared that they don't want to go to me when their the ones having a bad day. I hate the feeling of a day where everything is just normal, then somehow my heart start to feel heavy, or when I overthink and think of the worst case scenario only for it to be completely go alright. Last crying/breakdown session I had was a month ago, and it was all because I couldn't find an object that was going to be important for school later on. I feel bad for bringing jt up to my mother. Proving time and time again that I'm so out of my head and not aware of my sorroundings. I'm careless. I had sh myself over losing a thing, and now I have done it again simply because I can't stand to go back to school tomorrow. I suffer under so much pressure and deprecation that I have put on myself. How do I even explain that to people. Oh yes I hate myself so much because of what my brain thinks about myself and I have a completely normal life whatsoever. Never been abused or bullied, can you believe that?I just can't. Some days I feel like I'm just whining. Sure I might be crying now, but tomorrow I know I'll be alright and I might fool myself that I am actually fine, what if what I'm worrying about right now was never a problem in the first place. despite all that self-awareness, I would still repeat the cycle of feeling absolutely the worst to ""oh wait things are actuallt quite nice"" I don't know what to do with myself.",0
Why do I hide how I feel. Why can’t I tell the truth. I can’t tell people how bad I am. I’m afraid of the psych ward but also being a burden. I don’t want to make others life’s worse and I hide my own feelings. It makes it so much more painful.,0
Like I really don't wanna exist here . I only have 2 options run away or die . Third one is live this life that I would absolutely hate every moment of it I am afraid to do it by myself Caz I would fail probably.

"It's been months of this and while I'm doing much better now than before as now it happens once every other week it still sucks. Around February- mid April it was multiple times throughout a week where I'd feel like this. Just incredible loneliness and feeling betrayed by those I trusted and having to let go of the woman whom I still have feelings for. The love is Definitely going away but I'm afraid the love will be replaced with hatred. So many times I think of her now and I just remember how she used me to buy her a uniform which was almost $1,000. How she'd say some incredibly selfish and hurtful things to me whenever she was mad because she knew I never raised my voice to her or said things to hurt her. How she'd love bomb me in moments where I would potentially not be in her life anymore to entrap me. The nonstop gaslighting she did whenever I'd tell her how she did or said something wrong and not just when it was towards me but others as well. The inconsistency of her feelings towards me of 1 day saying she loves me and then the next saying she didn't. I could go on and on of all the toxicity of that relationship but in the end it was other people that broke the cables back. It was false stories told by others that made me realize I had to cut her off from my life yet even that hurts because I hate the way I did it. I just told her to go back to thinking I'm dead(it's a long story that someone else caused and I had to fix when I found out it happened) and that was the last thing I said to her in December. Once I'd remember the great times we had like when I took her to watch the 2nd miles morales movie and she wouldn't stop gushing over it for a week. All the laughs we shared like when I called someone whom we both knew a ""potato"" because of how incompetent he is and she loved that joke. Or when she'd feel incredibly sad and just needed me to be there for her so she'd cry on my shoulder or chest. How she lost both her jobs and I got her a new one so she wouldn't have such a sheltered life. The times I'd hear her tell me she hadn't eaten all day not because she's not hungry but because she felt so low she couldn't bring herself to move so I dropped what I was doing and drove to her favorite food stop(taco bell or popeyes) got her her favorite order which I memorized and brought it to her while she was at work. All those moments we shared and just like before I can go on and on of how amazing they were. Yet all I feel now is regret and sadness. I miss you B but for the sake of my own mental health I need help that you can't give by being in my life again. I have to keep you blocked on everything and stay no contact. No matter how much it fucking hurts.",0

I went on a website that have mh resources and I genuinely thought to myself, am I really considering dying just because of a fucking job? All I’ve been wanting lately is to end up in the hospital just so I don’t have to make decisions and can have a break. It’s so fucked, but it’s all I can think about. I ate a McDonalds just now and I feel so sick and I’m pretty sure I’ve got indigestion, but all I can think about is that maybe that indigestion is me about to have a heart attack or something. A part of me is *hoping* that it is. A lot of me hopes it isn’t. (It’s not).I just need a fucking break. I made a post a couple of months ago about needing to get away. I still fucking feel like that. But that post made me feel seen. The amount of people that commented on that, I felt like there is another way out. I wish I felt like that more. Like I’m supported. I just want to lie down, and sleep, and breathe, and not have a single fucking thought in my overwhelmed head. That’s all I fucking want. But I’ve got to wake up.

In my worst days, I would sit with my intended method in front of me and really, truly consider going through with it. I'd try to convince myself to do it. I knew what I would do and had the means, and had it within arm's reach. I sat there with the intent and goal of following through, but did not end up doing anything (except sh).

Like right now I'm severely sleep deprived. But whenever I'm not severely sleep deprived for a long streak nothing happens. But it's always right after I become sleep deprived or depressed or anxious these big things I need to address and deal with occur. They don't cause me to go into those conditions, I already had them and then the new challenging life thing appears at the worst point. It never seems to happen when I'm in a good condition overall and in a position to handle such challenges.It's just really frustrating and then adds on top of the already difficult condition I'm dealing with. So it's like why? Why the fuck can't these things happen when I'm equipped to handle them, to address them, to approach them in a good and positive way.

Im just do tired. I want to throw in the towel and have people just accept it. Ive always stayed for everybody else. And im so tired. I lived for them, i just want to die for me.

"Just so tired of going day to day, worrying about finances and how I’m even going to live, working a job that I hate so much that it makes me want to off myself, and busting my ass only to not even earn $200 in a paycheck (I work weekly, for reference). I’ve been searching for any new job that’ll give me any hours at all, but nothing. I don’t have a working car, so that limits things. I’ve begged for hours, nothing. I’m treated like shit and given nothing. I wouldn’t even be in this shit situation if it weren’t for financial abuse that I suffered a year ago that drained me completely.Tomorrow, I’m planning to go clock out on my lunch break, take a cab, buy some ammo and just finally do it. I don’t want to hear that it gets better. The last ten fucking years of my life have been a decline, and it’s only getting worse. It never does get better. That’s a lie.

"This sub did witness my process of dealing with my mental illness. I committed suicide 3 years ago but I didn’t make it then my mom took care of me until I felt better and thought my family would live a better life but accidentally my mom passed away. it was so tough for me but I knew my mom wanted me to be happy. then my My sister and I my dad went through this and had a peaceful 3-year life tho I didn’t have friends and I thought my sister was my best friend so everything is fine until now.  thinking back to the reason why I killed myself 3 years ago: I cut my best friend off and basically cut all my friends off. this time I’m gonna lose the important person my sister not cuz she’s dead or something. she’s married and has a baby in her tummy. She said that was accidental. I have to say that yes I’m selfish I don’t want my sister to get married. for me, it means she will be not that close anymore. I just said to her “u said baby is not ur plan by 2 years and I told u to use protection why still get the baby” Then she said she thinks it’s safe during that time then no protection. how I fucking hate parents bringing babies to this fucking world just “accidentally “! Ok I just feel loss and u guys could be judgmental that it’s her choice,she’s having her own family.I just don’t know how to do this life that no one’s gonna care and love u.my mom shouldn’t die.it should be me.she rescued from me overdoing but why I just don’t understand it.if I just died 3 years ago they could be doing fine.my mom would have her grandchildren but the reality is me straggling.we would both be dead.I just can’t deal with this life .no friends and family all alone and lonely.I think I would disappoint my mom and I’m sorry but grateful for giving my life tho I hated it at the same time.",1

"I am 35 years old, struggling with addiction. Life has been feeling pretty monotonous lately, with lacking motivation to continue moving forward. It feels like I'm just going through the motions of life, with no real direction or seemingly worthwhile goals to strive towards. I know motivation comes from taking action, however, after a while, depression sets in and I just feel like giving up and letting dreams and goals fall by the wayside. Life seems to have lost its sparkle, hence the desire to self medicate. Any thoughts?",0
"I (20F) feel like i don’t have any energy left for life which is strange because im only 20. I do have a history of struggling with my mental health and only recently have I been able to function a bit better. I often get a sudden feeling of dread when i think about life. I can’t help but feel very depressed when i think about the future or even the present. I live in a third world country that just keeps getting worse politically and economically. I am ambitious and wish to accomplish my academic goals but I can’t put in the effort that is needed for that. I guess that just means I yearn to learn and accomplish. Worrying about money has become an every day thing for me even though me have a good family income (middle class) My dysfunctional family also wears me down. I am getting therapy which is working in some areas but I still seem to be stuck. Even if I somehow convince myself to be optimistic about my future and about potentially going abroad for education, my family bursts that bubble by telling me they won’t allow that. It makes me feel stupid about wanting something like that in the first place. Like i’m not worthy or capable enough for that. Other than that, I feel very hopeless about the prospect of finding someone i like and who likes me back and is a good person. I just feel like i can only see people live a good life from far away but i cannot be a part of that. Oh, and i feel horribly guilty when i say this because there are so many people in the world going through absolute worst circumstances so it does not make sense for me to whine about this but i cannot control my honest feelings, can i?",0

"My mother keeps having these massive fights with my sister to the point of her threatening to leave the house and never come back or my sister ends up locking herself in her room and I'm always worried she will k!Il herself. I constantly feel guilty as I'm usually in the middle of it all. It feels like I'm having to console my mother over something even if it is her fault. This time I'm particular my mother and sister had a massive fight which ended with my mother throwing my sisters food away. What sucks is that l'm not close to my sister at all, even plan to go non-contact with her once she leaves home. I don't think I'll ever be able to love her and she's always been somewhat mentally abusive to me and my mother.Though my mother has severe anger issues and even though she is going to therapy it feels like I'm the therapist. I also thought I should to mention I go to therapy but I'm not ready to tell her this yet. I'm honestly scared to live at this point. I don't want to constantly be surrounded by this hell. My sister is dangerous and even though she's been offered therapy she won't take it or anything similar on that matter. Thanks for letting me vent to you Reddit as I don't have anyone else to talk to.

I have not cried in-front of some. (not even my best friends) for 7 years and my mental health has never been worse. ",0

"Unlike other adults, I don't have the best set of life skills in the world. At best I can do basic home maintenance, can poorly cook some things, and can drive (although I have driving anxiety so it's a pain to do that). I make $2000 a month if I work 45 hours a week at my job. For where I live with the expenses we have, we usually need to combine my income and my parents' incomes to survive. Not only would I have to suffer the emotional pain of losing them, I might end up homeless as well. Granted, even with the strained relationship I have with my parents, I'd still be incredibly hurt by their passing.Point being, I don't know what else I would do in my life after they're gone. Living is so fucking expensive and tiring, I don't know if I'd be able to survive on my own when I inevitably lose them. And my lack of life skills won't help either. I just feel so fucking lost.",1

Im scared and its probably scarier knowing that everyone goes through the same thing and they are able to get through. Maybe I will but maybe I wont. I feel abandoned no matter how hard I try. I think it is just self doubt and the people around me do love me. Even so sometimes I don’t want it. I don’t want to feel anything good because I will feel bad in the future. I don’t want a future sometimes and I might just want to not keep going. Don’t want to know the next step just want to leave it off. Im too scared to talk about this to anyone.

"Ive wanted to end my lifesince i lost my best friend at 9. Now im 18 and the only time i feel anything other tha a deep depression is when im loving or taing care of someone else. I love to love people so i dont mind that being my purpose in life, however its hard because i genuinely dont want to be here. My purpose is other peoples fullfillment, and if i end it now I wont be ale to take care of the people I love anymore, and knowing a lot of then are dealing with depression makes me never want to talk aout my true feelings. I feel as if Ive completed my turn in this life, like theres nothing more I can contribute, the only passion I have is music and my bestfriend of 14-15 years, who isnt my bestfriend anymore, he told me it was a stupid little kid dream I neededto let go of. I wanted to study to be a lawyer or veterinarian and had a scholarship from stanford at 15, but he begged me to stay because he ""needed"" me. I stayed. Last year i wasmeant to move to a different state and him and the girl i was w at the time, who he turned on me for, begged me to stay because they would be ""lost"" without me. I wanna be angry, but Im too tired. I only have the urge to fight now and I dont like to fight, but its all I want to do so i start one whenever i get the chance to. I want to make music for my friends, but idk who really is anymore, everyone calls everyone brother but I feel like Ive got no family. Which i do, an older brother and youner set of twins. We were all adopted into different families and no ones met the twins, but my brother wasnt the best to me growing up and I considered myself an only child after being told our bio mom tried getting those 3 back because they have the same dad.I only have a passion for music now, its always been part of my life, its the only thing that allows me the space to feel emotion without being labeled a b*tch.Music is my life but idk if its worth it because while i do want to speak for the silenced. I dont know if anyone will understand that its more than a pay cut. Its more than women and dr**s. I wish I wasnt so exhausted, I wish I was a better person, I wish I was as brave as people think I am. But im weak, and im tired and exhausted and i want my best friend back an idk how to explain to people that while I do love them, I wanna be with thepeople that genuinely loved me back, but theyre all d3ad and thats all they hear when I say it. Then its back to how theyd feel with me gon and I understand but Im 18, my best friend, my first love, the dad that raised me and his son, my granny and so many of my other friends from childhood are gone.Im 18, Ive been to 1 funeral when I was 4.I've been to 25 funerals as of February of this year.All I have the passion for is music, and the 'friends' i have that say theyll support my music dont understand its more than just the 'vibe'.Idk im lost, im sorry this is so long, but youre not alone in how you feel and I love you dearly even if we dont know each other.

"So on January I have opened a business, and I have decided to partner with my best friend as we complete each other in terms of business. We were driving a motorcycle, and we crashed. This night, I was traumatized as he almost lost his life,his  teeth has fell off, nose is severed, lips is splitted, and skull fractures. I have resumed the business on my own, and I fixed the bike as we shared it. Few months later he is better, and he started going to the gym and hangong out with his friends, and I am handling the business trying to make it reach the takeoff stage. But I failed doing it on my own. So I told him, now you’re better, you should be in charge because there is so much that I don’t understand, he said I willing to close it. So we agreed to close it. I am now working on a 9-5 job that I don’t really like, just so I can cover my expenses, and I remember all of those months I have spent on my own waking up everyday to be there for the business. Sacrificing my social life so I can take it somewhere else. All the money I have lost, and All what I saw in terms of stress and anxiety. It turned into depression. I don’t know from where to start and where to end it. But I lost money, business, friends, and a relationship as I broke up with my GF when the accident happened as my life turned chaotic in one night. I am still collecting the pieces, and I hope for an upcoming trend. But I feel nothing but confusion and a void. I don’t know why I am ranting here, but maybe someone has an intresting pov and perspective, that might aid. ",0

I’ve always been depressed and hypersensitive though dealing with ocd and bpd. I love my dad so much and I hate disappointing him. I know he does everything because he loves me so much as well but he can never listen to my emotions. He always wins the conversation while I get really pathetic and can’t react.

All these years I’ve been staying in my room most of the time, with some efforts to go out. I feel so so bad and guilty almost like a monster to him.

I adore dreaming and creating a fantasy world where I can solve my problems and feel things in my heart. I have a therapist. I have medication. But somehow I'm missing a part of me. It was stolen from me during my childhood. This is where my innocence lies dead. Burred just like the missing part of me. Its been so long that the void has intertwined with who I am. I no longer fear it. I am content with it. Like accepting your dinner is okay but still edible. I have no desire to rip it's roots from me. It has created who I am. No matter how much the void takes away the true depth of happiness I could feel, I will never hate it. I'm glad it lets me feel fleeting laughter and similes before dropping me back into reality. It's like a sudden drop into an ice bath. It's almost instant. My void doesn't even let me embrace the warmth of happiness.

"I seriously dont know what to do. I'm in a gc with 3 people, and one of them mostly just talks about how they want to hurt and kill themselves. The self harm, and often talk about how theyre planning to kill themselves and when they are, and stuff like theyre planning to buy knives to hurt themselves. Me, along with another person in the group, always try to comfort and discourage them, but eve if we get them to back down it aways comes up a few days later. Its almost like they dont want help. Often shooting us down and saying its no point when we're trying to help. Also often questioning why I'm trying to help them. How do I help someone who barely even wants help? Do they want help? I alwas try to stay there for them no matter what, and try to get them to feel better, but its honestly starting to come at the expense of my own health. Would I be a asshole if I decide to end things and stop being friends? I sad I would be there for them, and do everything to help them get better.

"M16. I’ve had this friend who’s a girl who we’ll call J. And we’ve been friends for about 3 years now. And how we first met was she was dating my friend. And they were together for about a year. And me and her got along really well and would talk frequently. I thought she was pretty and like I said we liked talking to each other. But I never really wanted to date her or anything so never asked or mentioned anything like that. Also especially because she was with my friend as well. Then they broke up but me and her kept talking because we became really good friends. I considered her probably my closest and best friend. But I still never mentioned anything about dating because I was honestly fine with just being her friend and also because I thought there was no way she would ever like me back. I have depression, anxiety and Body Dysmorphic Disorder as well as Facial Dysmorphic Disorder. Then she got a new boyfriend like a year and a half ago. And I was fine with that and we remained friends. Then they started having problems and “broke up”. A couple days after we were talking then she asked me if “I had some sort of attraction to her.” I decided to be honest and although I was hesitant because I was afraid this would ruin our relationship, I said yes. To my surprise, she said she was attracted to me as well and even said that when she was with my friend when she saw me, she thought she chose the wrong person. She said she always thought I was handsome and all this stuff. Then we went on a couple of dates and hanged out a lot more, and everything was going really well. Also side note and I’d rather not talk too much about it. But I’ve had a couple of incidents with self-harm and although it’s gotten a bit better, I still have thoughts about it every now and then, and my anxiety and everything else I mentioned is still really really bad. She knew this as well as the fact that I had to go to both a psychiatric residential home and the emergency room because of those incidents. And again, I don’t want to talk too much about it. But she was more like dominant I guess in our relationship while I was more submissive and she would comfort me and help me feel better when I was feeling really sad. We even took things to the next step if you know what I mean. And part of why we were friends and why I was attracted to her besides her looks was we had a lot in common, like, emotionally? We’ve each had really hard lives and could vent with each other and comfort each other. So she was complex and we could relate to one another. Also she wasn’t a complete idiot. Then it turns out her and some of her friends already had planned to go to this theme park with her ex. So even though she ‘didn’t want to’ she had to go and be with him again to do that. They would argue a lot when they were together, like a lot a lot. And after the theme park, everything seemed fine. Then like a couple of weeks later we were being intimate together and stuff. Then a while after, we started talking for a long time because she was feeling really sad. Then the next day she completely ghosted me. Turns out her ex contacted her again and promised to ‘change’ and bought her a locket or something. I guess she really liked that. After not talking to me for about 3 days she started talking to me again. Says basically let’s just be friends again because all that happened too fast even though she instigated all of it. I was heartbroken but said fine. Stuff was sorta okay for a bit. But I felt like I genuinely wanted not to exist and like I’m a huge fuck up and to be honest, sort of used and manipulated. And so badly just wanted to be loved. My at home life is pretty terrible, my parents divorced and are both really poor and in toxic relationships and not very nice to me to say the least. I eventually told her how I felt. And she said that she really does love me and meant everything she said. But I felt like she just felt guilty because she knows of my problems but was lying. I told her basically what I’ve said up till now and how horrible and badly I missed her. We talked a bunch about it. Then she asked ‘do I still like her?’ I said yes. Then she said let’s not talk for a month or two thinking I won’t like her anymore after that time. I had no choice but to say yes. And now I just really miss her and her kindness and love. And want to be friends again or anything really. Just to be loved. And I’m not really sure what I should do, I feel like I can’t move on. And like it could’ve worked. We had no issues whatsoever. Not a single argument. But to her I’m just a number 2. A second choice. And feel really really not good. I found a way to communicate with her after she blocked me on everything. A lot happened. We tried to just be friends. She kept sending photos of her with her boyfriend and saying how they’re gonna get married. She talked to me a lot less and also started acting different like a lot less nice and sorta like I was a joke. She then told me that her boyfriend fucking hates me now and so does all of his and her friends. I got mad and said I hate her. She didn’t like that. I told her I didn’t and I just hated myself and how I feel about her and was blinded by my emotions she didn’t care. Blocked me, no way for us to talk now. I tried to kill myself decided not to for my family. Now I don’t know what to do. I feel unlovable. She was the only person to treat me with any kindness or love and allowed me to have friends. I’m truly truly alone now and want to die. I still love her. And she hates me.",1
"I'm so brutally scared of interacting with people. There's been so many times in my life that people have randomly switched up on me I'm genuinely scared of people. There's been so many people in my life that has randomly switched up on me. I don't want to die but I don't want to live here anymore. I have such a warped view of life I don't even know what to think anymore. I seriously think I'm living in hell all I remember is terrible memories. I've been harassed so many times in my life and every single time I've had to just suck it up. I don't care what anyone says anymore this world is evil. We all live in hell we just pass the suffering around too eachother. I'm a devout Christian but I'm having doubts about god. I don't know if he's genuinely as powerful as he's claimed to be. I don't understand how god could ever allow evil to ever exist in the first place, he's god the creator of literally everything how could he ever give us a conscious and soul to live. Did god allow evil to exist because he's insecure and needs us to suffer just to make sure were being genuine with our love? How could I ever reciprocate love back to god when love has never genuinely been reciprocated to me? I genuinely despise my father for the things he's done to me and my mother did indeed raise me but it was never out of love, I was always just a burden to her. she did it out of not wanting to be called a bad mom infront of her friends and family. All she ever did to me was complain that I wasn't like other kids and then when I tried being like ""other kids"" (aka hanging out the very few friends I had by none other than the short side of a miracle) she would always threaten me and tell me that if I didn't behave she would kick me out and make me live with my drug addicted dad disown me etc. I don't know how to show love to anyone I don't know how to even act like a proper human being I've been so isolated my whole life. And I'm just expected by society to be a completely normal functioning human being because hey I was watered and fed as a kid right? Your life couldn't have been that bad, why arent I a hot charismatic multi millionaire oil rig working hunking stud of a hard working man yet huh? Get to work take an advil, your a man your supposed to be like guts and struggle through life. Your just supposed to suck everything up and shut up. ",0

"I have always been a sad child. My father hit me as a child brutally- Wooden rulers, metal rods, belts.. you name it. I was also sexually abused as a child by multiple people. I was fat-shamed and went to a catholic school where teachers constantly slut-shamed me.Then my parents sent me off to a boarding school and apart from harbouring feelings for a super straight girl, time there was nice. So, about this girl, she would constantly pull me close and push me away. Times when she would be with me the entire day and then disappear without explanation. I would cry and cry and cry and feel helpless.Then I went to university, and started feeling deeply inadequate about everything- my looks, my skills, my personality- everything. The first semester went by like this. Then, the pandemic happened and something In me clicked. I bought a foodscale, a weighing machine and started working out like 5 hours a day. Eating like 500 calories a day. Obviously, I lost weight, but I'd developed an eating disorder by then. All I thought about was my body and I couldn't stand to look in the mirror. Whatever I saw was so distorted, I had zero sense of my own flesh. Now the pandemic was over and I was back to university. Then started a long pattern of people- romantic interests, mostly- abandoning me. They would have sex with me and just.. leave. All of them. My bestfriend was the best human being in my life. He died by suicide. I was the one who found him. I screamed, shouted but no one came to help. Months later, a friend of mine and I just started having feelings for each other. We got into a relationship. I thought finally.. some happiness. But slowly, in the trenches of the relationship, I started feeling very anxious in the relationship. Feelings of deep abandonement. Fear of abandonement. The relationship started to suffer because my ex was also mentally ill, and I guess I was a lot to take in general. After a year of dating, they broke up with me. Thrice. And since then, things just unraveled. I became absolutely dysfunctional. I would drink the whole day and when I couldn't afford, I would have cough syrup. Or anything to keep me drunk/high. I was so anxious going outside my apartment. I saw ex everyday in college. I just couldn't stop going to college because I wouldn't pass without a 75% attendance. But that happened anyway. I left my exams. My degree (2-year Masters degree in clinical psychology) ended in April. I still have to give two exams I skipped, to complete my degree.In between this, I was on heavy Psychiatric drugs. As much as 15 in a day. Pretty sure I was abusing them as well. I am back home now, and no matter how hard I try I am persistently sad. I have been persistently sad all my life. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder. I have tried all the meds there are, I've tried to kill myself multiple times. I am neither dead nor better. I try to visualise a future, but the past doesn't seem to leave. I can't study furthur because I still have to complete my degree. I don't know what to do. Dying isn't that easy, I've tried countless times. I don't know what do.",0
"I'm a fucking idiot. Everyone knows i'm an idiot. Everytime i talk, i can feel everyone waiting for me to stop. Every time i walk into a room, i can feel people waiting for me to leave. Every time i look in the mirror, i agree with them. I hate when i talk. I hate when i walk into a room. I hate it all, and i hate the fact that i have to live with myself. The trans boy who sounds like a girl. The moron who doesn't know how to talk to people. The fucking piece of shit god put on this earth just to make everyone's life harder. I don't want to kill myself. But i've told myself for years that it's going to get better and it hasn't yet. How much longer do i have to wait? How long until i stop wanting to rip my brain out and stop on it? Why are these questions unanswered?",0
"Does anyone have experience with doing ECT? I'm trying to get accepted to start doing it in the next month or so. I have to get some tests done to see if I'm a good candidate. I know short term memory loss and head/jaw pain are pretty much guaranteed in terms of side effects. I'm not overly concerned with that because anything is better than my current existence. Does ECT work? Medication doesn't help, therapy doesn't help. ECT is the only tiny pinprick of light that I can see at the end of the tunnel. If it doesn't help or if I'm not accepted, I'm so done. Any thoughts?",0
"I’m still young, 21, but I’ve been suicidal since before I even knew what that feeling meant. When I was a little kid and still believed in God, I prayed he would take my soul in my sleep. The first time I was actively suicidal was when I was ~12 (I’m estimating, I have no timeframe of my life because it’s all such a blur). There’s been times things have been a little better, but I’ve never been really happy with myself or my life. I really don’t think I’m built to make it in this world/society. My anxiety is so bad it stops me from doing so many things (my therapist thinks I’m neurodivergent). I have a degree but can’t even use it, I can’t attend a job interview because of panic attacks. So I work stupid little part-time jobs, because I also can’t seem to manage working full-time without burning myself out, becoming so depressed I can’t get out of bed to go to work. Now I’m sitting here alone. The one relationship in my life that gave me a glimmer of hope for my future isn’t going to work out. I don’t have any real friends because I don’t have the energy, and people find me weird/boring/annoying, even my own family. I could go on for days I think, but long story short, I don’t see a way out besides suicide at this point. I’m not planning on doing it now or even necessarily soon, I just can’t stop thinking about how I know it is how I will die someday, sooner or later. And I’ve had this exact thought since I was a teen. I legitimately can’t picture myself making it far enough to die of natural causes or whatever. I cant picture myself living in the world as it exists today. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to keep going, so badly I want to just. stop everything. I don’t even necessarily want to die, I just want to have a life worth living instead of all this shit I’ve been left with. I try so hard - I’m on medication, I’m in therapy and EMDR right now, I try doing relaxing and fun things for myself, but nothing works to make me feel better. It all feels so artificial. At the end of the day, I think the logical conclusion is just that I will someday have to kill myself, it’s just about when. Right now I kinda really want to but idk. I just feel so weird. I can’t even describe it. Everything’s just wrong. My life has changed *so much* over the years, but my feelings haven’t. They say to hold on for things to change because you never know what your life will look like in x amount of time.. but things *have* changed, and they’ve changed a lot! But the one consistent thing had been my suicidal ideation ",1
"I really don’t understand this. I’m 25 and have wanted to die since I was in elementary school. It’s gotten progressively worse over the years. I have watched so many people die who wanted to keep living. Parents losing young kids to cancer and other horrible diseases when they desperately wanted a cure. Yet, I’m here. No purpose. No life. No joy. I have been through some hard things, but so has every person living lol. I’m not sure why I struggle so bad. Life could’ve been worse.  I desperately wish I wasn’t born. And, I wish that those who wanted to live had the opportunity to. Rant overWhy is life like this? It’s so unfair ",0
"Just as the title says. I am not angry, or sad. Just constantly empty. I have been sleeping a lot more because I simply do not even have the energy to get out of bed and exist. It feels like such a miserable existence. I don't want to die, I just wish I never existed in the first place. I'd elaborate but I don't even have the energy to type more than this. Does anyone else feel like this?",0

"I swore I was going to die before I was 18 years old. I am not worth it and I do not deserve everything I have, I am ungrateful. I feel so guilty for hurting everyone by attempting it twice. Now I'm crying more than before and it's always in my room at night, alone. They say that the strongest survive and I am just broken glass that can no longer be repaired. It is better that I commit suicide once and for all because I am a curse to everyone who knows and loves me. It may be that I have more flaws than strengths. Why the hell didn't I commit suicide that night? Well, who knows?Why doesn't anyone understand me? I hate being so sensitive. People say that I am not a burden, but life has shown me otherwise. Honestly, I want to die and one day I'm going to commit suicide. They say that the third time is the charm and I am going to make sure that it is that way with my death. It seems that I'm not trying hard enough because that's all I can give for now. I do not wish that I had never been born, but rather I wish that my soul had never been created. I have fantasies about my death and I always live in my imagination.",1
"Nothing feels good and nothing will. Just counting days being forced to live. It's all meaningless and there is no point.  What's the point of this suffering? What did anyone who died young miss? Just a lot of needless unnecessary suffering.  I don't get life. I don't get trying for anything. I don't want any of it. I actually enjoy being in pain. I wish for more. It's eye opening. I hope to never get fooled by this meaningless life, and I will always hope to die before the next second.  The only good thing about life is the end of it.  I literally don't get how people think about it as a gift and something like giving birth and literally cursing someone into endless opportunities of suffering and pain is a good thing.  I just don't get this whole thing. ",0

"Since a month the only person i ever cared about, the only person who made me feel loved left me, i just feel like I'm already dead. For some time now i just think on how to end. I'm a weirdo, i never could feel anything for anyone, since literally ever, my parents love me, i have a family i wouldn't want to trade for anyone but i never could feel anything for any of them, nor friends. And now that the only person who i ever felt something and made me feel loved doesn't want me, i even dream of ending my life. I try to distract myself with games, the work thing i go, and had 3 days of vacation with my family. Nothing is helping me to think of something else. I don't want to die yet, i don't want to make my ex feel the guilt and burden of my death, but my mind doesn't care what i want, nor my heart that won't stop loving my ex.",1
"Going to talk to my doctor today but I’m still Wondering if anyone here has switched from ADHD stimulants to an antidepressant? How was your experience?

"How do you deal with being below average intelligence. I know I'm will never achieve anything noteworthy, im surrounded by people who just understand the world in a way I will never comprehend. Am I destined to just work minimum wage for my life, which I dont mind because I try to make a positive impact on the world even though I'm never going to ""change the world"" or cure cancer or develop some software that changes everything. I feel insignificant compared to those around me. I can barely keep up in an intellectual discussion with those around me. My biggest love is movies and TV but even then I can barely keep up a discussion about the intricacies and details of my favourites. I feel like my brain understands certain concepts but lacks the ability to analyse and dissect them and actually put my thoughts into words. Is of if I have been nerfed by a higher power or something. I spent almost 5 years to get a simple 3 year bachelor's degree in computer science, every year was a struggle. I wish I could be like my brother who's logic skills are far above me who just understand these concepts with ease while my brain just struggles to grasp simple intellectual problems I know comparison is the theif of joy and all that but I just can't help myself wondering how thing would be different if I could keep up with my peers. I can't even hold a basic conversation of something beyond base knowledge,where I need to expand on my thoughts and ideas, it's as if im an NPC following flow chart of choices and ideas then I can't even follow when it becomes too complex, and even my own opinions im too afriaid to express for fear of judgement. Am I just doomed to be a bystander in life who just can't comprehend those around me and just go with the flow of the common believes not able to express myself in the way is wish ☹️Sorry for the rant just needed somewhere to write my thoughts and vent for a bit, I know nobody will read this but it's good to get it out. maybe I should start journaling or something hehe, much easier to type/write my thoughts and feelings than speak them out loud.

"I doubt I’d get one anyway. I live alone and I have no family or close friends, no one to call up and inform that I died. I don’t own much, I never did. I’ve had a shitty life and barely anything achieved in that time.

"You know how it is when you are struggling with suicidal thoughts for years and years. This year I finally snapped . Prepared everything (not that well$). Made some videos for my family, friends and stuff. Went to the beach and stayed their until the moon was shining. No one was there to prevent me from doing it . No one was there to save me neither . Ngl I was terrified as fuck. My biggest fear was deep sea and I still chose it to be my grave. You know what’s crazier ? Is that on my way to the beach, in my heart it really felt like I was already dead. I was just taking the road to meet my judgment. Even at the beach sun was rising like it was my time. I pictured my whole life and felt happy . I felt free . I felt grateful. So at night I took 4 or 5 sleeping pills, handcuffed my self and jumped into the water. Since I’m a good swimmer I managed to get far with the strength of the waves. I didn’t even notice I was far from my initial point. I can clearly remember it as  nightmare I had . I was drowning. Omg the pain. The salty water getting in my mouth and my nose was horrible . At some point I couldn’t even manage the strength of the waves. I don’t know what got Into me cuz it was blank at a moment (maybe cuz I was under water). I just jumped off the water and shouted “I DONT WANNA DIE YET” . I used all my remaining strength and manage to pull myself out of the water. I ran as fast I as could. Grabbed my backpack and my shoes and ran to the road since there were many crimes on that beach. I got home. At least no one watched my videos . I torn apart all my letters and deleted all the videos. Since then even while in the taxi back home, I was thinking.   I realized I own myself . I realize fuck this shit  man. I’m not letting anyone ever again to push to these extremes. I can’t put everything I feel in this post but. My point of view on depression, suicide, life , friends , family, girlfriend changed. I’ve being too altruistic my whole life. No more . Now I’ll think about myself first ! I have so amazing things to live and discover IM NOT LETTING ANY FREAKING HUMAN TO TAKE THIS FROM ME EVER . ",1
Begging to not wake up in the morning seems like a nightly routine. But I do nothing about it but cut myself. I am going to Idaho to see my kids and family in two weeks. I’m nervous and excited as I am getting closer to my final goodbyes with everyone. They don’t know I’m going to do this. My partner and I live away from them. He’s not coming with me this trip and I don’t want him too. He’s saying he’s not going to let me go because he knows what’s going to happen and wants to tell my family. I just idk. If he does then my plan will just have to go faster. I’m not trying to be saved anymore. I don’t want to be saved. I want to die. I want to not feel. I want to just go. Please let me just go in peace. ,1
When I was younger I used to be more confident but now that I’m older I’m so insecure it affects my daily life and makes me very depressed. I know people say to delete all social media but it’s so difficult to do that honestly I look at things that I know will trigger me it’s like kinda a form a self harm I guess just seeing people talk about certain things or making fun of a certain body type I know it’ll bother me. No matter how much I work out it doesn’t help and I feel like my body is never ever good enough it honestly makes me wanna just end it because there’s nothing more I want in life to be wanted and accepted. ,0

But that’s not a long term reason to keep on going. I barely have the will to look after myself, how do I find a reason to keep going?",0
"Where I’m from getting a gun can take months just because of the paperwork and licensing and shit, not to mention I just don’t have the money for a gun. So I wonder if it’s smarter to just go to gun range, act normal till they trust me, then end myself when the timing is right ",0
"I have been having suicidal thoughts for the past 2-3 years and have lost hope and any will to carry on. I’m 21 with autism, complete alopecia, and a couple other diseases and my doctor is testing me for testicular cancer. I have not had any friends in years along with any girlfriend or any luck dating. I feel weak and tired everyday and it’s now become too much. I feel like I’m cursed and can’t catch a brake and have no control over my life. I took a year off of school to help find myself and I feel worse off than I’ve ever felt before. I’m just tired of living a painful and lonely existence while I see everyone else having some sort of life. I feel like a burden on my family by not leaving the house much, having a job or any sort of social life. I know that my family loves me but I know that they don’t like me which makes me hate myself even more. The only reason I haven’t committed suicide yet is because I don’t want to cause them that pain. But I don’t see my life getting any better anytime soon, and I don’t know how much more I can do this. I simply don’t envision myself happy or healthy in a few years so it would be better to get it over with now.",1
"I feel like I'm slowly start to be tired of myself again, and with school coming soon it's probably going to be worse. I hate living not just because I get to be alone but I just feel like burden. I'm 16 and never found love yet, feel disconnected from my friends and parents, and just sits on my ass all day. I do take walks, workout,do chores for a dopamine boost but I'm afraid it ain't gonna cut it like it usually does. I had gone through depression before. Feel worthless and a disgusting corpse that is a waste of everyone's time to talk to. I've gone to. Mental hospital beforehand but I don't wanna go again because of the bill alone. And I don't wanna burden someone with my emotions. It feels selfish overall, I don't want to commit but everyday feels like drag. And I have to put on a mask every time. Any advice?",0

"Hi reddit, I'm 17 F and my depression and anxiety has spiked, it's becoming really hard to just go about normal life. It's summer break rn and no one is ever home anymore and when they are it's them talking amongst themselves about stuff I don't understand or they don't want me to hear. I know I have no reason to have these issues, and I'm just being childish for it but at this rate I don't know how I'm going to keep going. My mom has stopped talking to me unless it's to tell me to do something or that I did something wrong. She took my little brother 13 m and his friend fishing 2 days ago (my little brother ""lives"" at my step grandmas), and yesterday she spent it with my older brother 18 m and today she's with my older brother again. My stepdad is never home because of the work he does. I just sit in the house with the dog and cats. I only got my dog because after my 2 brothers both got a cat and dog, I freaked out because ""it wasn't fair"" and we got the keep the last puppy for me but they all hate him because he's dumb and was the rut so he isn't all there (the 10th puppy) in the end I keep having to see him get yelled at and hatted because I couldn't just be greatful that my brothers got all that. I don't what to do I just want to feel normal and not be an outcast in my own family. But I think other family members are starting to notice because they keep trying to invite me to stuff but my mom never makes it a priority so I never get to go. (I can't drive). Maybe I'm the problem because I can't do anything right and keep just failing at making Mom feel like I'm someone who deserves her love and I know I don't always treat her right but I don't know what to do. I get mad that the only time she talks to me is to tell me to do something but I don't know how to tell her that. I'm sorry to anyone who read through this I just need somewhere to rant ",0
I could really use someone to talk to. Im not doing so hot right now and would rather not discuss the details via comment thread. sorry and thank you,1
I never thought I’d end up where I’m at nor did I ever think that feeling this low and mental pain like this was even possible. A few hours ago I started cutting the fuck out of my arm. I’m not entirely sure why but honestly it feels good as fuck. Not the cutting or pain of it obviously but just something about it after just feels great. I approached a good friend of mine who I knows been there heavily and I vented about how I feel and talked about how somehow for some reason I’m here. He said it’s honestly a gateway drug that starts with chicken scratches and ends up with bear knives and ur blood hitting the ceiling. I know it’s probably a little exaggerated but I do know he’s really fucked his shit up. He advised me not too but here I am. Idk I guess I’d just share.,0
"Don't mind me, I'm not depressed but I just need a place to vent.My bf (22M) love baseball. His favorite baseball team won tonight. I'm happy for him. And he messaged me, ""I can’t wait to share more happy memories with you."" Sweet right? Well, we weren't even together physically when he sent that. So I know the motive for this affection is because his favorite team won. I used to receive more affection like that regardless of how well his favorite team was doing. But now that we've gotten busy and we're 6 months into the relationship, it's less. Which I've come to accept and I'm okay with. I guess it just hurts that those kinds of messages come when baseball makes him smile, not me. I remember crying about how I was worried that he wouldn't love me if his favorite team lost when we were 3 months into the relationship. That feeling, I hated it then, and I hate it now.",0

"first off, i know im a bad person. i just need to tell the truth for once, so i can feel like a man.okay so, me and my ex had been dating for 2 years. we both had our flaws, we were young, and eachothers first love. she did things, i did things, but what i did was way worse. in september of 2023 i commited my greatest mistake and sin.she was a special girl, at first she stayed with me and i swore to her i wouldn't do it again. but since then, she got further and further away from me. and i don't blame her for it. we were off and on but on the night of july 25th, she told me she was with someone else. i took it very badly because i still loved her (ironic, i know.) trust me, i know that i deserved for her to do that.i do regret it very much. i apologized to her a million different times, and i would do anything to make it up to her. i would do anything to warn myself, to change the past. i was a really bad boyfriend, but it only took something as tragic to realize that i was a bad boyfriend. i wish i could tell myself to be a better man so i wouldn't lose her.  i feel extremely guilty and depressed. i cry almost every day all day, even though i should not be the one crying. and i cannot take care of myself. when i look in the mirror, i see a boy who could not control himself. i lost the love of my life because i was so fucking stupid. since that night, i have been hung up on alcohol and weed. i also struggle to keep meals down and usually throw up alot. i also cut myself alot, because i feel as though someone as bad as me deserves to feel that pain.on top of it, im very jealous. i wish she was with me, and not him. but i know i shouldn't think that. i wish i didn't feel like this because i know im a bad person for doing this.what im basically asking is, how do i make it up to her? should i wait for her? she said she forgived me, and that she knows that i really would do anything to make up for her, but i feel like shes only saying that so i dont hate myself. the truth is that i do hate myself, and i can hardly look in the mirror.im not sure on how to be a better man. i know that i need to change, for her or for everybody. but im not sure how. i feel as though i will never be better than that boy in september who could not control his own body.i guess this post is open ended. if you want to comment bad things about me, that is fine. if you want to give me advice, that is fine. i need to know how to forgive myself, because i can hardly look in the mirror. i carry a great shame, and i just wish i had a time machine so i can tell myself to be better sooner. how do i make sure she knows that i would do anything to fix us? do i even have a chance of being with her again after what i did?she was my first love, and i still have very strong feelings to her. i know this is all ironic but i really just want to make it up to her one day. im struggling to move on because of my mistake. it feels like i will feel like this forever. im not sure if i could trust myself to date anyone else.thank you for reading this post if you did read all of it. i know im a bad person, but in making this, i hope i can become a better man for her.",0

I currently don't have any major life events happening other than I just fucking hate literally everything. I've been trying to quit for weeks and my therapist keeps talking me into staying. All I do is get pissed off at her for it. I DONT WANNA FUCKING GO ANYMORE. personally dont feel it's helping. Sure it's teaching me some life skills. Supposedly. But is it really helping my metal health? No it's not. If anything it feels like it's making it worse. I hate going to therapy, I hate going to class, they took my ADHD meds away because of a heart issue and for me to focus on a fucking class is near impossible. Let alone doing any sort of homework for the class. Then I don't get it done and I'm made to feel a fool during class and forces to complete the homework in class in front of everyone. It's fucking embarrassing. I wanna tell my therapist to fuck the fuck off. I'm so fed up with her fucking .. right? Riiiight.? . riiiight? Riiiight?. Blah blah blah riiiight? Blahblahbkah riiiight? Every god damn. 3 words she has to put the word RIIIGHT? at the end of everything and it drives me absolutely fucking insane Why can't I just say. "" Look I'm done"" and hang the fuck up and not have to deal with these fucks anymore. Why do I have to make an appointment to close my case and sign 30 pieces of paper stating that I am quitting? I fucking hate this system. I just want out without being made to feel like the complete piece of shit that I am. I'm a grown ass adult. I may not act like one but I am. But I'm being treated like a god damn 8 year old. I'm fed up. I just want out! I'm laying here in bed. Dreading therapy. It's in a few hours. And the last thing I wanna do is attend. Yet again. I'm getting pissed off and it's ruining my day. Not that I'm having any sort of pleasant day. But this shit is make it me wanna dive off the deep end into an empty pool. ",0
"29M autistic. Didn't even know I was autistic until last year. That makes things their own form of hard, could be the reason for all this, idk.I have always been interested in men as well as women, but I grew up debilitatingly religious. I was raised to do two things, love God, and become a great husband to a woman. So I got married. We will be married 7 years next month.My parents died, so I finally felt free enough to openly come out as pansexual. We were open for a bit so I could feel free, but then I got her pregnant like 4 months later. My son is pretty cool. He is almost 6 months old. Growing well.My parents chose my career died me as well. Been with the same company for over 7 years. Not a bad job, and it pays pretty well.My problem is all my life I was told how to life and how to love. By the time I got smart about it, I was really deep into people's dependence on me. I just want to enjoy life, but I have really been struggling to do so.When I get really high or drunk, it helps. But if I get too drunk I get even more suicidal. You would run that with a wife that needs me and a healthy son and a well paying job, I would be happy right? Nothing gives me joy anymore. I just want to get high or drunk so I can tell better. My wife isn't a bad person, just not a very good partner. At this point she is more my first child than my partner. Again, she isn't a bad person, just really dependant and don't have much capacity about taking care of me if I need it, emotionally.I don't believe that love exists. I believe that everyone that ""loves"" someone loves them for their expectations of them or their expectations of their role in their lives. This has been shown to me by my parents, my wife, that God I was supposed to believe in, and the final straw was my best friend. I got depressed and he got mad at me for not entertaining him as much as I used to when he would talk to me. Again, autistic, so when I get depressed I shut down.My body hurts, as I have sustained a few surgeries and some injuries. It always hurts, unless I am drunk or high enough.I know it seems like I'm bitching about being sad or something. I've seen people on here with way better reasons than me. But I'm just not happy. I'm living a life I never wanted for myself, because I only know how to give and give and give, and people don't really give back the same way I give, so I'm just running out.I want to be able to experience my sexuality without other people limiting me. I've been with men before, so I know what it is like. But right now, my only sexual option is my wife, which our whole marriage sex has been a weird topic, or masturbation, and the later is just not doing anything anymore.I worry about my son. What if I never get better, and my son just has a miserable dad his whole life? Doesn't he deserve a father that has his shit together without needing to be high or drunk to enjoy anything?I'm trying to enjoy life, I really am, but I just feel completely alone. Everyone depends on me and I make everyone happy, but I have no one I can depend on and no one makes me happy. Idk.The last couple months have been particularly bad. I really don't want to live. I know full week if I had a gun it would have been over by now. Idk. I haven't told anyone this yet either. No one knows.",1

I hate life and I don't remember  what happiness feels like,0
"i remember when i was feeling my worst, i had repeatedly asked my sister when she was going to come back home (she was practically living at her bf’s place). she kept telling me “tonight!” or “im leaving soon!” but she would never come home. i remember feeling so lonely and abandoned because i had no one else i could talk to.only when i admitted myself to the emergency room, she came. i don’t think i can ever forget the feeling of being abandoned. for her, her bf is probably her emotional support but for me, she is all i have. it felt so lonely to have my emotional support constantly absent when i was at my worst. it feels like i have been replaced. i constantly make the effort to reach out and spend time with her but she’s never around. she KNOWS how lonely i feel because i have told her once while crying pathetically. so it hurts even more that she’s still absent till this day. am i so insignificant in her life that my needs are being ignored? i resent her.now, i can’t decide if i want her around or not. whenever she does try to spend time with me, it feels like im the second option. but at the same time, i want her company but im so tired of constantly making the first move and then getting rejected. im so lonely and unloved. ",0
It’s just that one thing that went wrong but it ruined me. I’ve fallen into a deep hole of loneliness and despair. That saying “it’s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all” is bs. I miss the person I was before I knew this feeling. It’s all consuming. It’s been so long and I’m thinking now it’ll never get better. Everyday is a chore lately. It’s tiring to exist. Everyone tells me that I should be happy and that I’m doing well in life. But that just makes me feel more pathetic and guilty. That I feel like this when I have things to be happy about. I don’t want to die but I want to sleep forever. ,0

"I need urgent help, I'm so bad that suicide seriously seems like the best thing. Please.I am 16 years old, I am Colombian and my life has been somewhat complicated since before my birth, since I had and still have many medical problems such as hydrocephalus or Inattentive ADHD. I am quite limited in motor and cognitive issues, which has affected not only my social life but also my academic life(literally nothing specially maths or numbers in general gets to my mind even if I want them to). This directly affects my relationship with my parents, whom I have (literally) begged for psychological care because of all the shit that has happened to me. Sadly, they are the type of people who don't believe in mental health and minimize my problems by saying I'm an attention-seeking lazy person and useless.For several months or maybe a year now, I have been having anxiety and panic attacks almost all the time (in class, at home, etc.) and I have had a lot of thoughts about death and suicide, something that passes for my head all the time.

"I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety for most of my life (25 m) and I don’t know how being happy or satisfied for any real length of time feels. Atp depression and anxiety is just the norm. I feel so behind because of this I can barely keep a good job for any decent period of time because these feelings just slow me down so much. Most days I don’t feel like living I just want to end this nightmare. It doesn’t help that the world just fucking sucks and I always feel inadequate in every area of my life. My friends and family out pace me in everything, everyone else is making something of their lives and I’m just… nowhere. My girlfriend is getting promoted to manager of the same job I got fired from due to my inadequacies, meanwhile I’m working @ Dollar General making a measly $11 an hour.

"It was one hell of a journey. I wish you all the best.Hi everyone. I'm just your average guy. This will probably be nothing but mish-mash. I'll get sidetracked writing this down but you should get the general gist of why I'll be heading out first.Missed a few opportunities before I became an adult; and now the path to something I actually wanted to do is now closed. My ideal career did not match my creators'. I did not fight back, I did not resist. I just tried to trick myself into thinking it was what was ultimately good for me. I accepted it.I honestly am not sure. Sure, doing what you want to do as a job may cause you to lose passion. But looking at those who became very successful in the same path, who started much younger than I did, because when I was their age, I was telling myself my creators were right and I should not pursue what I want... I don't know. Maybe they're right. I could have failed, maybe definitely failed. But now I live with regret. Now that path is shut, steel doors permanently locking away that road for good.I've done nothing but rant over and over again to people I was close with. Ranting and being a negative asshole all the time, and we know that's a no-no. I've lost everyone in my life because of this. Remember, ""I'll always be here for you, in case you want to talk"" is not true. They just want to be polite. I should have respected their boundaries. I should have been less annoying. My friends began to see me as a nuisance, and now nobody talks to me anymore. My outer appearance is absolutely hideous. I can't look in the mirror anymore. I can't look people in the eye. I go outside with a face mask and a hat. I'm objectively disgusting. I hate every single part of me, and no, working out is not going to fix shit. You can't slap a fucking bow tie on a steaming hot pile of boar shit and say it doesn't smell bad anymore. I hate people. I hate everyone so much. Stop looking at me. Stop judging me. Stop telling me what I'm doing wrong. Stop feeling inferior to me, stop feeling anything about me when I didn't do anything to any of you fucking bastard cunts. I wish everyone somehow died simultaneously, maybe by a gigantic meteor striking the Earth, killing everyone. That would be great. I'd down a bottle of Jack Daniel's and watch as the rock gets closer and closer. Suppose my life is not a train wreck. Suppose everything flowed exactly how I wanted it to and now I'm living my dream. Would I be happy? Are you sure? I'm not sure. Maybe it could've gone better. But maybe. Maybe nothing changes. Maybe I still feel like shit. Fuck you all. You all try to validate yourselves; think you're better than one another, think you're cool, think you're going to be on top of everyone you know. Get the fuck out of here. Fuck you and fuck your stupid insecurities. You are the worst of the worst. Jesus Christ. Shut the fuck up.I'm so tired",0

"Hello, I am a 19-year-old autistic Brazilian, and I have come to the conclusion that I can't go on living like this. I have been working since I was 15, and now at 19, I started college, which is an hour away from my city. I simply can't handle working 8 hours a day, going to study, and only getting home at 1:50 AM every single day. I can't stand the people at my job, and I've managed to argue with all of my coworkers. Instead of just ignoring me like I do with them, they do everything they can to get under my skin; it's torturous. As if work wasn't enough, I have to deal with a classroom full of students I don't like, with ideals, personalities, and tastes completely different from mine. To top it all off, I have no peace at home since my mom can act like a bitch with me and treat me poorly, even though I bend over backward to please her. My dad only communicates with me through orders. I honestly can't take it anymore, and I don't think it's worth continuing to push through college just to finish, knowing that when that happens, I won't be living the dream life.

"It’s pointless. It doesnt mean I dont imagine what it’s like. Fantasizing. Yet I’m grossed out by it all the while. Separation of mind and body. People do things because genetic programming. Suicide goes against that. I want to die. Everything else is false. People are living in this insensible bubble. Reproducing, going to work, school. All of this pumps the machine. Energy for the circle of life. Creating memories and moments to make life bearable. Death is the ultimate form of making it bearable. An exit. Once I discovered this and at a very young age, the means of living became unbearable. A joke. Why live if I can just take the exit. I can avoid all of it. Emotions are not real. Placeholders to explain circumstances. I just want to take the exit more than anything. I don’t want to build. I don’t want to experience. I want total abyss. When I see a graveyard in a movie I feel ecstatic. Ecstatic might be the wrong word. I feel hopeful. Grateful that death exists. Jealous of those already dead. Wishing, longing, yearning to be dead. To reach the ultimate goal. The only sorrow I experience is for having a life. I wish I had not been born in the first place. I feel sorry for any life to exist. To suffer. To live a life of meaningless. Fossils show a lot of what I mean. Life once existed and now forgotten. Sum total of dust. Nothing. Empty. I wish I had never come into life. I look forward to exiting.",1
"Last week my father died. I miss him so much. He was my everything and stuck by me through everything. I didn’t always show him the love and respect he deserved and I feel incredibly guilty. I can’t stop crying and I’ve decided I’m going to tie a bag to my head and fill it with gas, I’ll be doing it in the next hour or so. What hurts more is I couldn’t get to the hospital as I didn’t have the money to get there. His funeral is later this week and I can’t get there either because of the same reason. I am so sorry I let you down dad and soon, when I die I’ll be up in heaven with you.",1
"Damn it. I've been on a pretty good streak for a long time, I hate to feel like I'm sliding downhill again. For a bit of context...almost two years ago I was fired from the worst job I've ever had, that dragged on for 11 agonizing years. It was a blessing in disguise and it led to me finding the job I have now, which I love. The hours are great, my co-workers are awesome, and I finally have weekends off to spend with my wife. I've been riding a high from that ever since I was hired. I feel so grateful for finally finding 'my place' that it feels wrong to be depressed, but here I am.The condensed version is: My wife and I are still living in our 'starter' home. We started out in her apartment, then moved into a duplex, and then after a really rough 4 year search, found our first house. It wasn't without it's hiccups: Of course we had a really limited budget, and then the only type of loan we qualified for that didn't require a down payment stipulated that we couldn't live within a pretty huge area. That being the case, a lot of the basic amenities we hoped for were cut off at the knees, and it seemed like we were always $10K short of being able to buy what we really wanted. We ended up in a pretty small 900 sq ft home in my home town (which I had really hoped to leave behind) in 2009.I can't complain, it's been a great little home, and I'm extremely thankful we have it. At the same time, we had hoped to live in it for 5-10 years and then find our 'forever' home. My mother moved us around a lot when I was a kid. I was constantly being ripped free and transplanted somewhere else. As I became an adult I vowed I wouldn't live my life that way. I wanted to move as few times as possible! So when I say forever home, I literally mean the one I want to be living in when I die. Within the last year or so, we've begun talking about moving, and have looked at a few places. As I'm sure most are aware, the housing market is absolutely nuts right now, and has been for a while. We're in the middle of a severe shortage of affordable housing. When we found out how much we were approved for, we were excited, and thought that all the hard work was finally going to pay off. Then we started looking and found out that, just like our first home buying experience, we're just short of being able to buy something decent. The part that really kills me is, we're not looking to live in a mansion. We're extremely moderate, we'd just like something a little bigger, like 1,100-1,300 square feet. Just enough so we aren't tripping over each other. I really hate to sound entitled, but after kicking, punching, and clawing for everything we've ever had, it'd be nice to have ONE thing go our way.Again, I feel terrible for complaining, since there are a lot of folks that don't have homes, or are struggling to buy their first house. I guess I just thought that by mid life, we might be able to see some of the fruits of our labor. Instead I feel like there's no point in continuing to look. I feel like we're going to be stuck in our cramped little house forever. Thanks for listening. ",0
"Sometimes I feel like there's no one to whom I can express my thoughts or feelings, although there are some of my friends but I don't feel like they would care, it's like I am talking to a person who isn't really interested. I am not depressed or anything but I think this emptiness would soon drain me. Going to college from the next month, and maybe even if I make some friends, I wouldn't be able to talk properly because I always think people are just doing me a favor when they chit chat with me, I guess because of my inferiority complex. ",0
"I feel like I make people mad just by being around. I don’t even try to make friends, but I just feel like everyone looks at me like they want me out of their presence even when I’m just walking past them. I just want peace, and to not exist anymore. ",1
"Ive tried to look online for a hotline at my country but nothing, I also tried to find chats, please help me life is so dark now and i just need someone.",1
"It felt like I've changed so much recently. I don't know how people don't realize how far I've sunken. I attempted back in March and people besides my mother only seemed to care for a week before going back to assuming I was fine. I wish people saw, I don't want to die, I just don't want to hurt. How am I supposed to believe people care about me when only one of my close friends cared enough to check in on me that night I was in the hospital for an attempted suicide? When people said they assumed I attempted suicide when I went to the hospital? ""Yeah that's what I thought."" when they asked why I was at the hospital. Not an ""I'm here for you"" but claim to be my friend. It's like I'm dangling off a cliff and they turn away because they don't want it to be their issue or they assume I can pull myself up. The few people who I do believe care about me don't know how bad it has gotten again. It always gets bad again, even if I improve for a bit. My loved ones don't see that when I get dressed for each day that I am dressing in preparation for if tonight is the night I decided to do it. They don't know that I am walking around and talking to people as if that is my last conversation with them. I fully expect each day to be my last because I am so so close to the cliff at the end of the river. I want to stop hurting, even the few times when I am happy, it feels like it won't last, so I might as well kill myself so I can die happy. O genuinely believe my death will be at my own hand. I can't tell this to anyone I know without being locked up, I just have to let things take its course and hope nothing gives me that final push.",1
"From the overflow of the heart,You reach and reach with no avail. You give and give until you are empty. You strive to find purpose, yet in your search, you exhaust yourself completely. In one moment you are cared for; every other moment, you are forgotten. You are mistaken by others, for it is easier to judge than to love another. And the love you do have is nothing but fleeting words—never actions. The things you once looked forward to now sour and make you ill. And you bleed and bleed to find help, yet soon enough, help itself becomes distasteful—a voided husk of repeated answers to weigh one down. Answers often unsolicited, laced in pride and ignorance. For once others learn what help means for you, they realize they can't or won't help. You speak and speak and speak, yet no words come out. No one hears you. As the tree that falls in the forest does not make a sound, you also do not exist. You ask and ask, and ask—you ask for one thing. Yet no matter how many times you ask, God is slow to answer and is preoccupied. All together, you have become seemingly voiceless. A silence that eats itself out of spite. A screaming in  the depths of a shallow sea. The only time you are seen is when you are drastic—and even then, in your cries for help, you are labelled by those unable to truly understand your affliction. Only leaving a greater mess than that was before. Leading you to be even more shut-in; more hidden due to fear and misconstrue. Finally forming within you, a facade so convincing, so realistic; a facade bent on preventing others from seeing the actual you—and seeing your hurt. An act so real, that even you deceive yourself into thinking you are okay, that there is nothing wrong.Giving into an act of isolation through a fictitious front. Where loneliness becomes so apparent, so consuming. Creating into oneself a vicious desperation to belong and to be wanted. Where any rejection makes the thought of being under a knife admirable.  Where cosmetics become a way to love oneself, a mask to hide in. Where talents become not shows of passion but a currency for buying affection. Where looks and skills question, proclaiming ""Would you want me if I were this?"" A loneliness to motivate an endless toil to belong—to be seen—to be loved. A loneliness to take all warmth. A loneliness so deeply ingrained that it starts to shape and define you.And when it all gets to be too much again. With this repetitious fall and climb into insanity, a trying insanity being your only sanity. When you get to the edge. With these forgotten fragments of script; these torn-up pieces of yourself. When it seems the Reaper opens a welcoming embrace to you. Gripped by a crushed spirit. With thoughts that used to torment that now comfort. You become faced with a truly terrifying decision, an utterly terrifying unknown.A decision into an unknown more unknown than any other—that stiffens one step, that saps one strength. An unknown that drains dreams and desire from one's very being, very soul. An unknown that takes all. And faced with this terror, with dread stalling movements forward and memory siphoning all power left to escape, you become trapped. Imprisoned between the lines of destruction and hopelessness. Glued to a perpetuating suffocating misery. Snared by a loop of a self brought about hell in the inability to complete a task. Forced to suffer a slow death due to the fear of death itself.  And the more you try to run from this despair, the closer it gets. If you stand still, it still overtakes you. What can you do? Though you fight for better days, what can you do? And if only the heart was a bottomless well, then it wouldn't overflow into writing. Yet it seems bottomless because the heart is still longing. ",0
Does anybody have uncontrollable dark or negative feelings?  I hate it.  It sparks anxiety for me and causes me to feel physically ill when it overtakes me.  Would be nice to know I’m not alone.,0
Someone close to me told me to leave them all alone because I burden them with my problems. I can barely cope with my problems as is. I can’t take it much longer. If this is what life is then I can’t ,1
"I don’t cut myself, I don’t starve myself, i’m not into any freaky shit, I had a good nearly perfect childhood, I displayed only some self destructive behaviour in my younger teen years that I grew out of pretty fast, i’m not diagnosed with anything apart from an anxiety disorder, I don’t hate myself, I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. I don’t think I’m very intelligent and dropped out of school young, I don’t understand other people. I’m against the traditional teenage “fun” stuff pretty much. I love to go outside and have quite a few hobbies, l can feel myself getting more mature but I still want to do it. I have a cool girlfriend who I’m long distance with currently and we plan on doing a bunch of fun stuff in the future. I still believe I’ll commit suicide soon Last year was one of the worst years I’ve ever had, I lost everything and I find it very hard to care about anything anymore ",1

My therapist wants me to love and accept myself but I don't understand why I should. There are obviously hierarchies in life. I'm retarded and trans so Im at the bottom and I can tell by how people treat me. No one likes me or wants to be around me. At a certain point some people are worthless and everyone knows this bc they will treat you accordingly. But when the people who are worthless come forward the answer is to just love yourself as if you arent told differently by everyones actions. I just can't wait until I will finally get to die. No body has ever liked me and no body ever will. ,1

"I’ve struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 11, and since then I’ve been on and off medications and in and out of therapy. Nothing has helped me. I’ve been too comfortable with the thought of my own death my entire life and the logical part of my brain is disturbed by it, but at the same time the thoughts don’t ever leave. Recently they’ve been getting much worse, I can’t even drive some days because my intrusive thoughts beg me to run into a pole or another car. I don’t wanna ruin anybody else’s life so I don’t, but life is so monotonous and unfair. It’s not fun being alive. The only reason I stay alive is because my friend passed recently and seeing how ruined everybody is guilts me into not doing it. But I wouldn’t want people to be sad, I wish people understood that I just want to rest forever. Living is tiring and I just want to be at peace. ",1
"So I have hung in there for years now, working on myself and trying to building a life for my future partner. Well I'm exhausted, and it's never going to happen. No loving wife, no kids, just an empty life caring for others and working until I drop dead, to be forgotten. I didn't think I what I wanted was unreasonable, SO many of my ancestors had it. But I am invisible to women, and just getting older every year. I never cared about the money, I just wanted to love, and be loved in return. But every single partner I had threw my love in the dirt and walked away. I wanted to build a life, and it turns out, they just wanted to have fun, and keep having fun. I am so very tired. Tired of this nightmare, of all of societies lies, just everything. I yearn for the grave.I spend more and more time now either sleeping in my free time or in a fantasy world with my dream girl, where I am at least loved and cared for. I think this life was just a mis-step, perhaps the person I was supposed to be with died young, or was never born? I can't imagine a world without here, yet I've never met her, and still, feel I have, and feel her absence every single waking second. My mind reels against this reality.",0
39/F- Idk if I’m depressed. Medicine and talking doesn’t help how I feel. I’m sad most of the time where I can’t remember being happy. Idk if it’s just my brain or if my life does suck. I look at social media and I see lots of tragic  stuff and think well my life isn’t that bad… and then I have conflict at home with my kids or their father… and I just get right back thinking I’m so tired of getting everything wrong. I think think think… and I still do the wrong things. Is it depression when u think everybody hates u and ur not good enough? I can’t handle it when i hurt peoples feelings… I can’t handle when they tell me I did something to hurt their feelings. I feel attacked a lot. When people are distant to me I feel like it’s my fault somehow. I get easily overwhelmed and I get frustrated with my kids and I feel like I screwed up my first two sons. Now I have a toddler with another father. Who helped me with them but their real dad doesn’t believe in meds and therapy so we never got the help with their issues. Both dads feel like the kids just needed discipline. The first two kids have adhd. And I’ve always been told I’m too nice. They’re doing a lot of reckless things and I fear they will end up dead or in jail. Then I have a toddler… i decided to plan a pregnancy with my bf at the time. A constant cheater 🤦🏽‍♀️ I don’t even remember why I thought this would be a good idea. Because I thought he was a narcissistic abuser. He kept cheating. And I have been miserable with and without him…. I regret making the baby because now the father feels like we have to keep contact. Then said well I think our son needs us both living together in order to have a fighting chance and be diff than ur other kids… and then recently he was diagnosed with Autism. It was a sad stressful pregnancy… so idk. Idk if it’s just my life is full of reasons to be depressed or if I’m being a cry baby or a snowflake. The dr’s diagnosed me with depression but I think I have ADHD or maybe I’m autistic too…. They won’t evaluate me for ADHD or Autism because I’m too old. ,0
