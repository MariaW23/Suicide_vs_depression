###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,4,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2364,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2364,,False,True,,False,,[],{},,True,,1572360722.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses.

,depression,"I am 24M and I was booking an escort to finally gain some experience and lose my virginity. I even got to the point where I verified my ID through her screen process and I sent a $50 deposit. I ended up cancelling the booking due to fear of law enforcement in my area. With the election season this year, law enforcement is really ramping up their presence where I live. It is considered a felony to even exchange money for sex, and it is punishable for up to 2 years in state jail. I really wish this was completely legal. I think that it is very wrong that I could catch a felony and completely ruin my life only because I wanted to experience physical human connection for the first time. I genuinely don’t see myself losing my v-card the normal way at this point. The idea of a woman truly loving and caring about be for who I am feels like such a foreign, completely unfathomable concept to me. 

I am working full time 40 hours a week while attending an online university for full time software engineering. I genuinely enjoy learning how to code, and I find my classes to be very fascinating for the most part. Due to my work and school obligations, I had to cancel my sessions with my therapist because I realistically didn’t have the time to see them anymore. I feel so hopelessly alone for not having any experience with women at my age. I have been struggling with depression, social anxiety, and suicidal thoughts since I was 14 and it still persists to this day. Some days I contemplate withdrawing out of my 401k to purchase a shotgun and finally blow my brains out.

When I was in high school, I went to the gym regularly, lifted weights, and meticulously tracked my calories to lose weight and improve my appearance. I also made changes to the way I dressed and I initially felt better about myself at the time. Despite these efforts in improving my physical appearance and making a genuine attempt at trying to feel better about myself, I still experienced rejection and even bullying from women I was attracted to. They would say “eww” to the idea of dating me and they would even laugh in my face about it. This completely destroyed my self-esteem and it made me very scared to talk to women, even in a friendly platonic matter. I have since then gained all of the weight back plus more. I have been trying to work on myself since then, and I have lost 30lbs so far after finding a physically demanding job. I don’t work there anymore, but I have still 
maintained my weight loss.

I have lots of trouble making connections with others. I haven’t made any new friends since high school. Thankfully I have a few close friends that I am still in contact with regularly.

What should I do to make myself feel better? I have been feeling extremely lonely lately and it has been taking a very significant toll on me. Should I go back to the gym or try a different form of exercise? I really want to go back to therapy, but I can no longer afford it and I don’ have the time anymore due to working and studying both full time. I pretty much spend most of my days working and studying. I used to enjoy video games and reading, but I no longer enjoy them anymore. 

Thanks for reading.

I even got to the point where I verified my ID through her screen process and I sent a $50 deposit. I ended up cancelling the booking due to fear of law enforcement in my area. With the election season this year, law enforcement is really ramping up their presence where I live. It is considered a felony to even exchange money for sex, and it is punishable for up to 2 years in state jail. I really wish this was completely legal. I think that it is very wrong that I could catch a felony and completely ruin my life only because I wanted to experience physical human connection for the first time. I genuinely don’t see myself losing my v-card the normal way at this point. The idea of a woman truly loving and caring about be for who I am feels like such a foreign, completely unfathomable concept to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working full time 40 hours a week while attending an online university for full time software engineering.

,depression,"Been together for just over 10 years. Husband was diagnosed with depression and anxiety when he was a teenager (Domestic violence). He's taking meds now. We've had couple's therapy from Dec to April this year.

Normally, he's an introvert, low energy but jokes around with me and communication is not an issue, very kind and mild person. If he's down, he plays some video games, watches some game videos he likes then he gets better.

The issue is when we argue about something. He either likes to blame me, and completely talking about his side. (If I focus on his side, he says something and I reply, no problem, we can communicate back and forth) But if I want to talk about my side after he's done his side, he either loses focus gets drowsy or even fall asleep, or tells me it's wrong, or calling me delusional or saying blaming me for making no sense, etc.)

Usually that gets me very frustrated and emotional then the argument gets more escalated and he either loses control calling for a divorce or leaves the house.

Today he took it out on me when the dog bit him. I said ""Don't take it out on me."" He started accusing me for not punishing the dog enough, etc. Anyways I tried to leave the conversation before it got bad. (I just said Don't talk to me until you're calm.)

In the past, i was the one that couldn't take the silence and always tried to make an nice gesture or apologize (I don't want to do that anymore. I'm so tired)

Could you help me?

1. What should i do?

Nothing really matters, because in a billion years the sun will go out and we'll be wiped into obscurity. The fact is that there's no real deeper destiny or secret meaning to the human race, and we're truly not a result of anything other than crazy chance. This tiny spinning rock in space just happened to have the perfect distance from a star and balance of elements to create and continuously support life. And we're nothing more than a bunch of clumps of cells that somehow evolved to think and, as a result, understand the utter gravity and hopelessness of this insignificance. Because it is hopeless.

And yet, we live. Nothing matters, and yet we form relationships and create art and get angry when we lose in a video game and feel nice when we're sleeping on soft things. And we create customs in which every person has their own day per year when they are celebrated for simply being alive. And we harness lightning and transport it through rocks we found in the ground just so we can be warm and have light and watch videos of other humans. And we feel enough loyalty to which part of our tiny planet we were born on or which category of other humans we are attracted to that we hang designs of cloth to represent those parts of ourselves. And we understand how little our small pocket of life matters and have moments of sadness, when the gravity of existence and obscurity places its full weight onto our chests. This sadness too, this feeling of lonely unites us. Because our world is small, but we are all living on it. Because there's a whole lot of black out there, and yet right now we are close enough to a star to bathe in its warmth and light. 

And when a billion years from now the sun goes out we will die, and that will mean none of our experiences will have had a single effect on the broader history of the universe. But still they happened, and maybe that's enough to say they mattered, at least to us. We will die but we will die together, in the same blinding flash of life, holding each other on this tiny rock surrounded by darkness and stars.

But now I'm in debt with nothing to show for it. A few weeks ago I broke up with my ex because things aren't going well. And by that I mean that my parents absolutely HATE him. I'm tired of arguing it about. I'm tired of having to defend my partner. And the sole reason they hate him is the fact that he's an immigrant. And unless I marry him, I don't think he'll get papers anytime soon. But I'm scared. I don't think I'm ready to get married. It seems like a big commitment.

Everything in this world is a fucking joke and its affecting me in the worst way possible. I have descended into this state of being cold... I've become a cold hearted, emotionless husk that can only operate at work. Once I'm at home all i do is sit, game, eat or fantasize about a better life that is so out of reach.

Outside my 4 walls that i call home, i am continuously met with a society that cannot seem to accept one another. My very religious family is always out there to condemn every choice i ever make or have made in the past. Society is always trying to convert other people to their belief system whether that is religion, gender, political, socio-economical or even food related and the pressure of being confronted by that is just over exaggerated. Now don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their own choices regarding beliefs or gender identification but just stop laying it so thick on people especially people like me. i have had to deal enough with mental pressure/manipulation in my teenage years and now that i am almost 30 i have to continue battling my way through more mental pressure because other people cant handle the way you live your life?

I didn't know her, but she was really close to my best friend. we're all 24/25 y/o. she told us she was with her last night watching the match (we're from argentina) and that they were going to have dinner tonight, and now she's in the police station
she hanged herself in her house. and her dad found her

I'm wordless

i thought about the many many times my friends were scared about me and what could i do, i think about the moment my dad would found my body if i did it, how guilty he'd feel (i had major issues with my dad but we've been at peace for 3 or 4 years now)

it's horrible, it's a fucking nightmare and I'm so shocked and I don't know what to do with this overwhelming feeling
I couldn't stop crying before writing this

so many people died inbetween yesterday and today... one argentinian guy died just before the match, because he went to the obelisk to cheer, he climbed a thing there and then fell off it... he landed with his head

,depression,"This is kinda a vent post but I do want support to help.
I'm currently at the hospital with a sister in law having a baby. Her whole family is her and their friends. My husband's family is very conservative and they always jab at us for being alternative / emo etc. (Also I'm sad I can't have a child right due to finances  now had a miscarriageast year around this time) so I'm on edge I guess. Trying to not cry. But I'm sitting here in the waiting room and I say to my husband's mom, ""I hope they let us babysit when she is more grown I'd love to."" They look at me like wtf no. I instantly try not to cry...

Then I'm talking about how if I have a kid I'd try to get on all fours because that's better and easier for the women, it's a more natural position than laying on your back.

A family friends goes, ""omg if you have a child it be like the exorcist""

Like wtf does that mean?
That I'd scream and cry cause yes I would obviously anyone should.

I&amp;#39;m currently at the hospital with a sister in law having a baby. Her whole family is her and their friends. My husband&amp;#39;s family is very conservative and they always jab at us for being alternative / emo etc. (Also I&amp;#39;m sad I can&amp;#39;t have a child right due to finances  now had a miscarriageast year around this time) so I&amp;#39;m on edge I guess. Trying to not cry. But I&amp;#39;m sitting here in the waiting room and I say to my husband&amp;#39;s mom, &amp;quot;I hope they let us babysit when she is more grown I&amp;#39;d love to.&amp;quot; They look at me like wtf no. I instantly try not to cry...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;#39;m talking about how if I have a kid I&amp;#39;d try to get on all fours because that&amp;#39;s better and easier for the women, it&amp;#39;s a more natural position than laying on your back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A family friends goes, &amp;quot;omg if you have a child it be like the exorcist&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like wtf does that mean?
That I&amp;#39;d scream and cry cause yes I would obviously anyone should.
Or that I&amp;#39;d have a demon baby cause they are mad I&amp;#39;m not Christian conservative. &lt;/p&gt;

I feel cursed. I don't know how to explain but this is how I've been feeling for now 3 years.

I feel so depressed, helpless and misunderstood that I just lost hope this feeling will leave me for ever...

I've been depressed for 1 year as a 10 y.o because of bullying and other stuff. It was so bad that at a point I had suicidal thoughts on daily basis.
I escaped this horrible soul crushing feeling somehow... or so I thought.

On the last year of middle school the same feeling comes back but this time the situation was way different.

I had A LOT of people around me but only a few actual friends. Even though I was loved from a lot of people, I felt so so lonely...
To the point that it was getting hard to fake being happy.

The reason of that?? I DON'T KNOW!!!
I mean, I lived some tough things but I went through worse.
I tried to find the reason why but was unsuccessful and I still am...

These waves last for sometimes weeks but longest was 7 months (last year).

Last year I had a whole week where it felt like I was in a constant nightmare. I felt lost, extremely tired and kinda scared for some reason.

It's been 3 years since it came back and it's killing me inside. I feel like a hole in my chest and I can't fill it.

I wanna fill it with love but even that is too much to ask for, I somehow will end up ruining it like a lot of things.

I feel like I will never experienced real love, unconditional love, mutual love. Someone always ends up getting hurt.

,depression,"There’s just too much pain for me to handle. I feel I either die or go insane.There have been good moments in my life but im constantly reliving the bad.It started off when I was living in Georgia. My mom had got on drugs really bad when I was 4 years old and my sister was 6.I remember her and my dad always arguing bc of it.Waking up to mom holding a knife towards dad and then screaming at each other.It was every day and every night. Along with living in a bad environment constantly getting robbed,my parents allowed a homeless guy to live with us for a while and he would lock me and my sister in a room and beat us and cover my mouth. Just alot of bad shit. Until one night my dad had enough and I remember vividly him laying with me and my sister and telling us we were leaving in the morning to Kentucky to live with my grandparents.So the next morning we woke up,threw a bunch of shit in the car and left my mom.I can remember her chasing behind us and screaming not to leave. But my dad thought that would be the best thing to do for our lives. So we made it to ky and I met my grandparents. My grandpa was my dad and uncles step dad and my mamaw was their real mom. When we first got there it took a long time to warm up. My grandpa and grandma had to drag me and my sister out of the corner and I remember just screaming I hate you and I want to kill you and I didn’t even know them.so grandpa made me pick a switch. They were very strict.Eventually we warmed up to them and settled in.Dad stayed with us there. Not long after being there my dad had decided to take me and my sister to his friends down the road and they were all drinking and playing guitar. Having a good time. Til we all eventually headed outside on the porch and in the yard. Me and my sister stayed on the porch and was hitting a punching bag. And this is where the trauma in my life got worse. Nathan. My dads friend was very drunk and I remember him walking outside with his eyes closed with a shotgun barrel to his head. Faced towards me and my sister. And boom. I remember it all. My dad tried to calm us down and say that he accidentally shot himself in the leg. But that wasn’t true. He had killed himself right in front of us.A couple months pass since that and my mom starts calling my dad saying she’s off of everything and she’s doing better. So my dad tells me and my sister he is gonna be gone for a couple of days to pick mom up. I remember hugging him balling my eyes out saying please don’t leave please don’t leave.But he had to.But then a couple days go by and he’s not back. Papaw and mamaw say he’s spending time with our mom for a while. We were extremely sad but figured we would see him again. But no. December 13,2009. My Dad had picked my mom up and on the way back got into a fatal crash and died. My mom survived. The time we thought he was staying with mom in Georgia he was actually in a coma for 6 months.The day my grandpa told me he had picked me up from daycare and my sister from school. He said there was good news and bad news. He told us to choose one or the other. We both chose good news. He said our mom is back. But wouldn’t tell us the bad news until we got home. Where my family was in the living room crying because they found out about him dying and so did we. My mother had to pull me away from the casket.She stayed for a week after the funeral. Then one morning me and sissy woke up and she wasn’t here. She had abandoned us without even saying goodbye. So now my mom is back in Georgia. On drugs even worse and me and my sister are living with my grandparents.Fast forward 3 years. Im around 8 years old my sister is 10-11.We have already been through hell but that wasn’t all.I remember I was taking a shower cleaning myself. And when I get out I hear the door sling open. It’s my grandpa. I grab a towel and try to cover my body and hes just pulling it out of my hands trying to reveal me. He had a camera. He took multiple pictures of me naked and scared. And I’d rather not know what happened with them. He also molested my sister in many different ways. We didn’t realize what he had done until we got older. I was 13 and my sister brought up something he had done and it made me realize what he did to me. So we both decided to tell my uncle. My uncle told us not to confront him or anything and seemed like he believed us. The next day at school I told my cousin Audrey about it and she started balling here eyes out and it had gotten around to the office. Eventually I’m called to the office and one of my aunts are there to pick me up. She looks angry. As soon as I get in the car she asked me very irritated “What have you and Emma been making up about my Dad? We were in middle school and she instantly shut us down. My grandpa called us crazy the family believed it  and sent my sister off to an institution and when she got back my grandpa had molested her again and I backed down completely and said it was all a lie on my part because I thought they wouldn’t love me anymore and I wouldn’t have a family.My grandma had cancer during this time and died in 2013. The whole thing had blown over not long after and we were pretty much silenced.My sister came back eventually but always snuck out and tried to find ways to not be there. So it was Me my sister and papaw. Until my sister was 18 then she was out of there. So it was just me and my grandpa.And my mind had completely tuned out everything I guess for the best to keep my sanity and not kill him.I stayed with him as his health got worse and he had gotten dementia and his liver was failing. He started forgetting everything and defecating in the floors and I had to keep a baby monitor beside him in his room and one in mine.

I feel I either die or go insane.There have been good moments in my life but im constantly reliving the bad.It started off when I was living in Georgia. My mom had got on drugs really bad when I was 4 years old and my sister was 6.I remember her and my dad always arguing bc of it.Waking up to mom holding a knife towards dad and then screaming at each other.It was every day and every night. Along with living in a bad environment constantly getting robbed,my parents allowed a homeless guy to live with us for a while and he would lock me and my sister in a room and beat us and cover my mouth. Just alot of bad shit. Until one night my dad had enough and I remember vividly him laying with me and my sister and telling us we were leaving in the morning to Kentucky to live with my grandparents.So the next morning we woke up,threw a bunch of shit in the car and left my mom.I can remember her chasing behind us and screaming not to leave. But my dad thought that would be the best thing to do for our lives. So we made it to ky and I met my grandparents. My grandpa was my dad and uncles step dad and my mamaw was their real mom. When we first got there it took a long time to warm up. My grandpa and grandma had to drag me and my sister out of the corner and I remember just screaming I hate you and I want to kill you and I didn’t even know them.so grandpa made me pick a switch. They were very strict.Eventually we warmed up to them and settled in.Dad stayed with us there. Not long after being there my dad had decided to take me and my sister to his friends down the road and they were all drinking and playing guitar. Having a good time. Til we all eventually headed outside on the porch and in the yard. Me and my sister stayed on the porch and was hitting a punching bag. And this is where the trauma in my life got worse. Nathan. My dads friend was very drunk and I remember him walking outside with his eyes closed with a shotgun barrel to his head. Faced towards me and my sister. And boom. I remember it all. My dad tried to calm us down and say that he accidentally shot himself in the leg. But that wasn’t true. He had killed himself right in front of us.A couple months pass since that and my mom starts calling my dad saying she’s off of everything and she’s doing better. So my dad tells me and my sister he is gonna be gone for a couple of days to pick mom up. I remember hugging him balling my eyes out saying please don’t leave please don’t leave.But he had to.But then a couple days go by and he’s not back. Papaw and mamaw say he’s spending time with our mom for a while. We were extremely sad but figured we would see him again. But no. December 13,2009. My Dad had picked my mom up and on the way back got into a fatal crash and died. My mom survived. The time we thought he was staying with mom in Georgia he was actually in a coma for 6 months.The day my grandpa told me he had picked me up from daycare and my sister from school. He said there was good news and bad news. He told us to choose one or the other. We both chose good news. He said our mom is back. But wouldn’t tell us the bad news until we got home. Where my family was in the living room crying because they found out about him dying and so did we. My mother had to pull me away from the casket.She stayed for a week after the funeral. Then one morning me and sissy woke up and she wasn’t here. She had abandoned us without even saying goodbye. So now my mom is back in Georgia. On drugs even worse and me and my sister are living with my grandparents.Fast forward 3 years. Im around 8 years old my sister is 10-11.We have already been through hell but that wasn’t all.I remember I was taking a shower cleaning myself. And when I get out I hear the door sling open. It’s my grandpa. I grab a towel and try to cover my body and hes just pulling it out of my hands trying to reveal me. He had a camera. He took multiple pictures of me naked and scared. And I’d rather not know what happened with them. He also molested my sister in many different ways. We didn’t realize what he had done until we got older. I was 13 and my sister brought up something he had done and it made me realize what he did to me. So we both decided to tell my uncle. My uncle told us not to confront him or anything and seemed like he believed us. The next day at school I told my cousin Audrey about it and she started balling here eyes out and it had gotten around to the office. Eventually I’m called to the office and one of my aunts are there to pick me up. She looks angry. As soon as I get in the car she asked me very irritated “What have you and Emma been making up about my Dad? We were in middle school and she instantly shut us down. My grandpa called us crazy the family believed it  and sent my sister off to an institution and when she got back my grandpa had molested her again and I backed down completely and said it was all a lie on my part because I thought they wouldn’t love me anymore and I wouldn’t have a family.My grandma had cancer during this time and died in 2013. The whole thing had blown over not long after and we were pretty much silenced.My sister came back eventually but always snuck out and tried to find ways to not be there. So it was Me my sister and papaw. Until my sister was 18 then she was out of there. So it was just me and my grandpa.And my mind had completely tuned out everything I guess for the best to keep my sanity and not kill him.I stayed with him as his health got worse and he had gotten dementia and his liver was failing. He started forgetting everything and defecating in the floors and I had to keep a baby monitor beside him in his room and one in mine. My aunts would sometimes come check on him and ask me how he was doing and they had me take care of him and clean him up and everything.He eventually got to the point he was stuck in a hospital bed in the living room right where my grandma passed. His days did not go on much longer and I got on pills in this part of my life so it was all just a bad time. He died not long after.So I moved into my aunt and uncles but ran away and stayed at a friends the majority of the time. Sissy had her own place now and gave birth to my nephew a couple years later.

It's been over a month since I haven't thought about offing myself. I used to subconsciously daydream stuff like a rope tightening around my neck, as it felt liberating, but now I am not having such thoughts since sometime.

I am not keeping up a rigid routine or trying to commit to anything, only trying to keep up the basic hygiene routines like brushing and bathing every day. If I don't feel like doing any other chore of the day, I don't force myself to do it and neither feel bad about myself.

I am trying to be loving and forgiving to myself.

I am also planning to slowly commit to people. 

I hope I keep this up.

I do not worry much either.

I wish no one loses their hope.

Its all okay, whatever you are feeling is valid. If u dont like anything, that is okay. If you are tired to get out of bed, that's okay. Everything is okay. Try to love yourself a bit. Even if that's not possible, it's okay.

,depression,"Broke up with my girlfriend of seven years about about 4 months ago. Seven was our special numbers so I was going to propose July. I feel as if I did it because I was depressed and I lost myself and I lost trust because I caught her lying so many times about silly things. Started to feel I lost us and we were arguing a lot and one day I just snapped. I have been regretting it.

Then lost my job, which I had a really great opportunity at, and it was purely due. The reason I was depressed from the break up, and I couldn’t get myself out of bed for a couple weeks. I feel like I’ve just been drinking and being sad and I’ve tried to eat healthy and go outside and be with people and I just felt depressed and sick like I’m not myself anymore.

I’ve always had depression, yet I’ve always dealt with it very well. I moved out of the house early on Was fairly successful. I don’t get the chance to visit my parents very much. I always knew my mom is a wine drinker but these past four years. I’ve slowly seen her basically kill herself with alcohol. This last year was just got really bad and I feel like I’ve already lost her. 

I’m a big mama boy I can’t even have a normal conversation with her anymore, she can’t walk, and she is starting get dementia from drinking so much. This Mother’s Day she called me by the wrong name and was totally out of it. Life has just been moving so fast. I feel like I didn’t even notice it and she was the best supportive mom growing up so I just don’t understand what happened. Recently, she asked me to go get a gun and kill her, and I didn’t I didn’t even know what to say and just left it just broke me. In and out of rehab have costed me and my dad so much and she just doesn’t wanna get better. I feel as if I’m gonna lose her any day now.

And then I had two friends commit suicide one last month, one this month and I had no idea if their struggles. The first you know was rough cause he had four kids so I just basically tried my hardest to help take care of everything for them, but it was a rough process. Then just last week my buddy shot himself and left a note which I was mentioned in. His mother asked me to write a eulogy for his funeral. This is his one of my close friends who I would come to you when I was down, and he was the best at working me through it. I couldn’t find the words, but I eventually did and I wrote it and then when it was time to go up and read it, I couldn’t even speak a word and had to have someone read it for me.

I have a lot of close friends that love me and then I can talk to, but for some reason, I am so embarrassed and have a hard time opening up other people I don’t want to see the weakness. I’ve always been really confident and I’ve just lost myself and I don’t really know who the fuck I am anymore. I’m only 25 years old and I feel like I dealt with my depression great with hobbies and staying busy. But this year has just crushed me and I don’t even know what to say or what to do. I started a new business which is going well and I have a second job so I’m helping out with a lot of family financial problems. Yet I hate myself and I hate my life, I feel I lost myself along time ago and now I just covered up with drugs.

It feels like rockbottom and that’s not even all of it. I’m trying to keep it short. I don’t know why I’ve came to myself so much and I’ve tried therapy, but I just filled so disconnected. I miss my ex-girlfriend and she needs time alone and I feel stupid for letting her go. I’m looking for support and advice because I feel broken and wanna get better but I still just sit here and weep every day.

Where is the light at the end of the tunnel? ",t2_9bk4v39z,False,,0,False,"Rough year, feel like my life is crumbling and I’ve lost myself.",[],r/depression,False,,,0,,True,t3_1e4eypc,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1721101636.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broke up with my girlfriend of seven years about about 4 months ago. Seven was our special numbers so I was going to propose July. I feel as if I did it because I was depressed and I lost myself and I lost trust because I caught her lying so many times about silly things. Started to feel I lost us and we were arguing a lot and one day I just snapped. I have been regretting it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then lost my job, which I had a really great opportunity at, and it was purely due. The reason I was depressed from the break up, and I couldn’t get myself out of bed for a couple weeks. I feel like I’ve just been drinking and being sad and I’ve tried to eat healthy and go outside and be with people and I just felt depressed and sick like I’m not myself anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always had depression, yet I’ve always dealt with it very well. I moved out of the house early on Was fairly successful. I don’t get the chance to visit my parents very much. I always knew my mom is a wine drinker but these past four years. I’ve slowly seen her basically kill herself with alcohol. This last year was just got really bad and I feel like I’ve already lost her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a big mama boy I can’t even have a normal conversation with her anymore, she can’t walk, and she is starting get dementia from drinking so much. This Mother’s Day she called me by the wrong name and was totally out of it. Life has just been moving so fast. I feel like I didn’t even notice it and she was the best supportive mom growing up so I just don’t understand what happened. Recently, she asked me to go get a gun and kill her, and I didn’t I didn’t even know what to say and just left it just broke me. In and out of rehab have costed me and my dad so much and she just doesn’t wanna get better. I feel as if I’m gonna lose her any day now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I had two friends commit suicide one last month, one this month and I had no idea if their struggles. The first you know was rough cause he had four kids so I just basically tried my hardest to help take care of everything for them, but it was a rough process. Then just last week my buddy shot himself and left a note which I was mentioned in. His mother asked me to write a eulogy for his funeral. This is his one of my close friends who I would come to you when I was down, and he was the best at working me through it. I couldn’t find the words, but I eventually did and I wrote it and then when it was time to go up and read it, I couldn’t even speak a word and had to have someone read it for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of close friends that love me and then I can talk to, but for some reason, I am so embarrassed and have a hard time opening up other people I don’t want to see the weakness. I’ve always been really confident and I’ve just lost myself and I don’t really know who the fuck I am anymore.

,depression,I dont know. My heads pretty messed up lately. Im still in high school but actually moves schools in November 2023. My old school was a really good school but was far from my house. I was pretty popular there and it was fun to be there and just overall a great experience. I had made quite a few close and loyal friendships and life was good. This all changed when i moved schools. Now my new school is in Centrale London whereas the last one was Kent. two VERY different places. My new school is a state school. My old school was a grammar school. Now i moved because of the travelling issue as my dad had to drive one hour to get to school. Now to my new school i just take a train. Now one thing is that the school is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy smaller than my old school. it makes things feel cramped and congested all the time and i have nowhere to breathe. although the drugs/vapes/smoking/pollution in the air doesnt really help either. Just to say but my school is a whole year academically behind. Ive been TRYING to study hard but that is hard to do as ive gained a new sense of laziness. Ive been making no friends as everyone in the school is just toxic and i mean TOXIC. The downright play their own friends and insult them with no filter ofr apologie or even a 'im just kidding'. It just makes you feel like sh1t. Ive been constantly stomped on and made fun of by my cleassmates even though i do litterally nothing and try not to draw attention to myself and i envy the kids who arent brought to the topic of the conversations. People gossip about me at every corner and mix up my words on purpose to get something interesting. ive tried to make friends and it worked fine at first but then they kept on insulting me or saying im annoying or calling me weird.

My heads pretty messed up lately. Im still in high school but actually moves schools in November 2023. My old school was a really good school but was far from my house. I was pretty popular there and it was fun to be there and just overall a great experience. I had made quite a few close and loyal friendships and life was good. This all changed when i moved schools. Now my new school is in Centrale London whereas the last one was Kent. two VERY different places. My new school is a state school. My old school was a grammar school. Now i moved because of the travelling issue as my dad had to drive one hour to get to school. Now to my new school i just take a train. Now one thing is that the school is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy smaller than my old school. it makes things feel cramped and congested all the time and i have nowhere to breathe. although the drugs/vapes/smoking/pollution in the air doesnt really help either. Just to say but my school is a whole year academically behind. Ive been TRYING to study hard but that is hard to do as ive gained a new sense of laziness. Ive been making no friends as everyone in the school is just toxic and i mean TOXIC. The downright play their own friends and insult them with no filter ofr apologie or even a &amp;#39;im just kidding&amp;#39;. It just makes you feel like sh1t. Ive been constantly stomped on and made fun of by my cleassmates even though i do litterally nothing and try not to draw attention to myself and i envy the kids who arent brought to the topic of the conversations. People gossip about me at every corner and mix up my words on purpose to get something interesting. ive tried to make friends and it worked fine at first but then they kept on insulting me or saying im annoying or calling me weird.

,depression,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m desperate for help and advice regarding my partner's severe depression. We’ve been together for 5 years, and while their depression and suicidal ideation have been mostly manageable, things have recently taken a steep downward spiral. Their suicidal thoughts are now constant, and we are in a state of crisis.

They have been switching medications, but nothing seems to be working. This has led to multiple trips to the ER, and we are desperate to find a medication that will provide some relief or at least a glimmer of hope. Unfortunately, inpatient treatment isn’t an option due to a previous terrible experience they had (the psychiatrist repeatedly forgot their prescriptions, they were exposed to other patients having meltdowns, and overall, it made things worse).

We live together, and they don’t have many friends they can lean on. I work full-time remotely, but I’m running on fumes trying to take care of them, maintain my job, and care for our pets. They have daily panic attacks and meltdowns, and I feel like I’m reaching my breaking point. Despite this, my instinct is to continue supporting them, as it feels like their life depends on me being there for them.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you cope and what steps did you take to help your partner? Any advice, resources, or just words of support would be greatly appreciated.

,depression,"I'm in my early 20s soon to begin the mid age, ever since I was 13 or 12'ish I knew this person who I cared about, I won't get deep into it but we have so much history together and we were super close and know a lot about each other, but I'll be honest, fuck this guy, entering adulthood I've tried be a supportive girlfriend when we dated, a supportive bestfriend when we broke off the relationship and came to terms with it, managing to still be good friends through in and through out. But fuck when it got tense it got tense, I don't feel right giving people space when they're upset (unless they state it themselves or hint it as best as they can without putting it into words) so I'd be the one to try and cheer him up as much as I could even if it really did seem like it never did much at all (though he'd tell me otherwise and say it would.) 

We hung out every day or almost every day for years, so it could get draining when either of us spiraled into a bad mood for whatever reason, yeah he'd try here and there but I'd say when it came to helping the other feel better I was good or at least, effortful when it came to it, I loved him so much just as the person he was regardless of his flaws and I looked passed his cold demeanor he'd put on sometimes. I am pretty much crying because I just dished out so much for this fucking guy who in the last moments of what I really do assume was our friendship, he couldn't look past me just being a fucking human and being overwhelmed with something we were working on together, I may have sucked at the communication bit but he got so fucking angry at me simply for just being overwhelmed? I tried man. 

Where he was lonely I tried introducing him to friends, where he was upset financially I'd offer him what advice I could offer that seemed realistic at best for what little experience I have with it. I admit at some point there was a falloff with how clingy I was with him and I admit to obviously being immature when we were younger but I have matured since then, so much so I'd say that maybe I am more mature than him, I recognize and don't blame people anymore for feeling emotions- the way he definitely-fucking-does, and maybe- this is just assuming on his side; he just didn't like seeing me become and grow into my own person- in the sense that I wasn't basically dependent on him for learning things and being the only friend I had because I eventually made new friends years later (I'd say, when I turned 22 I started opening up more etc) after being a loner aside from him being my only friend for practically my whole life and me living through abusive family trauma, plus a side dish of even more trauma outside of family for days on end; lasting for years which he definitely knows my life history because he was and I say without exaggerating- my other half, he knows more about me than my own mother probably does (that's how close we were.)

Anyways, some stuff went down between me and him last year that left a scar on our friendship, where he decided to disconnect from me and our mutual bestfriend at the time, the bridges he tried burning left me to drop being friends with that other friend shared between us. I missed him every day for months, but I tried looking past it to finish school because I wasn't gonna let people who left me hurting so much stop me from graduating; and just around the time I finished school, he had tried talking to me a few things for lesser important things, eventually I had managed to reconnect us as friends, and him opening up and reconnect with his other friends because he tried doing a self isolating thing, which I immediately recognized as destructive and unnecessary but still forgave him for it because I was not a stranger to doing self destructive things myself. 

Any who- yeah, I looked past it even though it was an awful time for me, we were friends as usual again etc. I thought everything was alright and maybe after that went down- I thought we learned to be more understanding basically of each other, but nope. Rewind to around May, me and him get the idea to work on something together, blah blah blah, I eventually start feeling extremely overwhelmed easily but I am afraid to let him know that, so instead of telling him how I feel I try and rub it off instead of talking to him (because, I have a history of being a people pleaser- I don't want to upset him) he eventually asks to talk to me about the thing we were working on, I tell him how I was feeling, he lets me know basically that he was frustrated with me, the conversation on his half feels colder, I thought we were just talking things out but nope, he lets me genuinely know that he really just frustrated with me when I thought he'd be understanding and not lash out at me for being overwhelmed as I have stated to him- multiple times, so I'm like- ""Ok, I will give you space, sorry."" at that point forward we are half ways done through May into June, he hasn't said a damn word to me while making it very obvious he is just doing literally anything else, I know his schedule too so like- ??? There would've been no fucking reason for him to cold shoulder me and give me the silent treatment since our argument in the middle of the month, I give it some deep thought like- ""Yeah- wow, I really fucked up he really just isn't talking to me at all."" 

I vent to my other friends that he just isn't talking to me so while I confide in my other friends for guidance and support; I actually let my other friends know if this guy doesn't talk to me into the next month of June, I'm just cutting him off because what's the point? I feel scolded for having emotions in a fun project that wasn't even taking off yet and was really just in discussion phase. There was nothing being lost yet- at least to me; though in our argument he pointed his finger at me and said some shit like ""You have an income; I don't"" so I guess I was actually obligated to work on it with him or something, even though I tried being there for this guy while he tried looking for a job and shit though that never went anywhere. Lol... alright man. Anyways, it's pretty much June now, I just let him know what's what, I leave him with the details of our project because he just seemed more passionate about it than I was at this point and I just cut him off because this guy was just so fucking unforgiving, I think to myself that that's it- and a side of relief but also a hint of shame, that shame grew because I didn't feel right carving him out of my life but I really didn't know what else to do when the guy who I cared so much about didn't talk to me for the rest of the month of May.  Skip to a few days ago where I reached out to just talk to each other, see if maybe we can just hear each other's side. At this point I don't expect anything anymore, other than to just hear it out and MAYBE be understanding, but I don't even think that happened. I feel like all these years were genuinely wasted because in my newer closer friendships, I just can't give as much enthusiasm and care that I gave to this one person who I considered my other half. All the hours and attention and care and support I definitely fucking gave feels like it was going into a garbage chute with nothing to gain but shitty compost- in other words. I feel like this guy just left me with nothing but hot steamy shit on my chest. It is my friends birthday today (the one I met around Christmas), (not the guy who I've been venting about) but I feel like I just couldn't provide enough celebration and positive attention to him because I feel just a dark cloud of depression looming over me right now. I feel like shit man, I can't win no matter where I think I'm getting better I'm really not, I want to cry so fucking much, so many years of expending so much energy on this guy. I don't know if me and him will ever pick back up to the spot we were in before the project when we were good friends with each other. I'm too much of a people pleaser to be thinking about someone who cold shouldered me for half the month of May and never was understanding about what \*\*I\*\* was dealing with or HAVE dealt with when I gave him basically all I could ever offer another person. Insane, I'm so fucking tired. I want to off myself most days, I feel like a decayed corpse with nothing left to offer to anyone because I am sucked fucking dry.

,depression,"Last year I was referred to an ent about my nose who said I had a slight deviated septum. I have always been self conscious of my bent nose however he pointed out things I didn’t notice before like a slight nose hump etc. said he would fix them.

Besoin de parler du vécu qui est actuellement en train d'arriver et n'arrive plus à surmonter

Mais il y a 2 mois tout c'est écroulé subitement, mon activité c'est brutalement stoppé, l'administration m'ayant retiré les autorisations me permettant de travailler... et tout cela à cause notamment de MES propres erreurs et prise de décisions catastrophique 

Ne pouvant quasi plus travailler j'ai malheureusement dû licencier le personnel et doit faire face à de multiples problèmes : procédure judiciaire en cours, forte amende (en centaine voir millions d'euros), licenciement des salariés, prison mais vraisemblablement sursis, contrôle fiscal j'ai fais que de la merde avec ma société, impossibilité de payer les charges à venir, liquidation judiciaire, faillite personnel... Bref une erreurs que que je risque de payer toute mon existence

Depuis ma vie est devenu un véritable enfer, je vis dans le stress permanent; je ne dors plus que sous Stilnox et sous Lexomil, je n'ai plus le goût à rien, je suis en dépression sévère et n'ai que des idées noirs...

Je passe mon temps à ruminer, me dire que j'aurais dû faire ci faire ça, comment j'en suis arrivé là, j'en veux à tout le monde alors que le seul fautif est MOI MEME

,depression,"I (24M) am currently going through the most devastating breakup. I was with them for over a year and was their main support system and cheerleader, but a little over two weeks ago they ended our relationship because it's been causing us both a lot of stress and they said they haven't been in it anymore since April. For context, they are on the other side of the country for a summer internship and the distance (and preparing for the distance) has been extremely difficult and very anxiety-inducing for me, to the point where I was constantly questioning our relationship and their true feelings- I could sense this breakup coming for weeks but was convincing myself that they were being distant and keeping me at arm's length because of how busy the internship is. I gave them everything and bared my soul to them and was planning a future around them and only stayed in my current city because they weren't ready to move yet (they're local). Now I'm stuck in a lease that it will cost $1500 to terminate early. My mom came the day after the breakup and spent a week with me, and I genuinely don't know if I could've gotten through it without her there the entire time. Things were starting to get better but I've been feeling worse since Friday. I've started Wellbutrin and am waiting to be upped to the therapeutic dose and take hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety and every night to help me sleep. I also go to therapy every week and my therapist is helping me move through this, but it also feels like I'm never feeling my worst when it's time for my appointment so she's not there when I really need her. No one's fault, just poor timing I guess.

Because of all of this, I have made the decision to move closer to home so I can be closer to my family and friends, as I don't have much of a support system where I'm at. I moved here for grad school two years ago and haven't enjoyed the city I'm in at all nor had a good experience in grad school (finished in May). The program was nothing like I was expecting and the students and faculty both created an extremely toxic and stressful environment on top of not really having a well-define program, making me feel like I didn't really get anything out of it- especially since I struggled to get through the first year and received an extremely negative first-year review. It felt like there was a vendetta against me, a theory that was only strengthened by everyone else's impression of how I was being treated as well.

I've been applying to jobs and had two interviews today. The first one went fine, but it would require I go through another 12 week class plus take a board exam after a year. I'm currently doing an online program to take the board exam in a different but related area, and both exams are through the same organization, but I'm two weeks behind (prof gave extensions because I told him some of what's going on) and currently sitting in a fast food restaurant trying to cram for an exam I need to take by sunday night. 30 minutes before the second interview (which was the one I really wanted), I was called by my recruiter and told that I actually was not eligible for that position and would not be eligible for any equivalent positions in other departments at the same facility. This is a separate facility operated by my current employer, and I have the same qualifications as people I work with that are in the position I was applying for, but there was some complicated reason I wasn't eligible at the other facility. I could get into all of that but it's a lot of information and isn't necessary.

In March, my supervisor essentially promised me a promotion to the position I was applying for. She then left the company the next month and her replacement has given me the same ""I don't know, I'm waiting on a response from corporate"" answer every time I've asked her about it.

  
My anxiety is so crippling that my chest always feels tight and I can barely eat or drink when it's flaring up. It's so hard to get through each day, especially those that I don't have work or plans and spend alone. Coworkers have commented that I've lost weight. 

TL;DR- Going through an emotional breakup that doesn't seem to be getting better after two weeks, trying to move, having trouble finding a job and apartment, bad experiences in both of my degrees, and made an empty promise by a former manager that never went anywhere.

Someone befriends me, I get attached, then they ask for (what seems to me at the time like) a small favour.

,depression,"I feel so broken inside that nothing seems enough to mend the pieces. I feel like I am the sum of my mistakes, failures, and regrets. Except for a few days, it has been a very long time since I have felt peace. I've carried this heavy heart for as long as I can remember. The depth of my sadness knows no bounds, yet it feels hypocritical, as I have never faced true loss, never had to go hungry, beg, or feel violated. There are so many good things in my life, yet I am unable to be grateful for them. Only when I lose them do I understand how much I care and how much they mean to me. And I always lose them.

I am never able to express my love and affection for the people who stood by me in the darkest times. I fail to treasure them and respect their value. I lie here sad and broken, fully aware that I have hurt people terribly. Though I might not have done it intentionally, I did nothing to stop it. I've made decisions and choices for which there is no one to blame but myself. I have always hurt people, leaving them disappointed and sad. I can't think of one relationship in my life where this hasn't happened. I have hurt myself too, making terrible decisions that led to many mistakes.

I feel like I have not achieved anything in my life. Even now, I am afraid I am indulging in self-pity. This terrible feeling of sadness, guilt, shame, regret, and loneliness just does not seem to go away. And why would it? I have not been a good son, brother, friend, family member, or boyfriend. I have failed both in my personal and professional life. I lie here heartbroken, knowing I have caused so much pain and suffering.

I have hurt someone I truly love, and I don't know how to feel bad, because it is not me who suffered because of my actions. Now, I am alone, having broken all relationships. I don't have a friend to talk to or a girlfriend to share my heart with. The loneliness feels like a huge weight on me, one that I can't shed no matter what I do. I have not treated myself right. I have been undisciplined, inconsistent, and careless about myself, the people in my life, my feelings, and my life. I have chased impulsivity and short-term gratification.

I have not respected others or taken care of them because I have not respected or taken care of myself. Sometimes, I wish I could just fulfill all my responsibilities and make my parents happy, because after that, I might be able to end the suffering completely. Because I cannot take much of this anymore.

I want to look at the ocean again and feel peace. I want to laugh and dance when I feel the rain on my face. I want to enjoy the wonders of the world. I just want to stop feeling so worthless and aimless.

I&amp;#39;ve carried this heavy heart for as long as I can remember. The depth of my sadness knows no bounds, yet it feels hypocritical, as I have never faced true loss, never had to go hungry, beg, or feel violated. There are so many good things in my life, yet I am unable to be grateful for them. Only when I lose them do I understand how much I care and how much they mean to me. And I always lose them.&lt;/p&gt;

couldn’t let myself do nothing for the time i went home. got a job at a cafe too. i didn’t rest as much as i wanted to. yoga became a chore instead of a method to help me cope, and now i have extreme anxiety around teaching and everyone is expecting me to start now. i signed a lease that i can’t escape and im moving back to my college town. everyone is excited for me but i can’t find a way to be hopeful. every time ive tried to be, i still end up in the same situation. i’m always the odd one out. i was at least excited to live by my boyfriend, but he’s moving for a job and we will have to be long distance still. outside of my personal life i feel like i have so much awareness around how rigged the world is. i will never be rich enough to afford my basic necessities bc i don’t dream of having a job. there’s not much i feel passionate about besides music and i don’t feel i can succeed enough to make money. i feel like ill be stuck working these stupid low wage service jobs forever. i

yoga teacher training bc i couldn’t let myself do nothing for the time i went home. got a job at a cafe too. i didn’t rest as much as i wanted to. yoga became a chore instead of a method to help me cope, and now i have extreme anxiety around teaching and everyone is expecting me to start now. i signed a lease that i can’t escape and im moving back to my college town. everyone is excited for me but i can’t find a way to be hopeful. every time ive tried to be, i still end up in the same situation. i’m always the odd one out. i was at least excited to live by my boyfriend, but he’s moving for a job and we will have to be long distance still. outside of my personal life i feel like i have so much awareness around how rigged the world is. i will never be rich enough to afford my basic necessities bc i don’t dream of having a job. there’s not much i feel passionate about besides music and i don’t feel i can succeed enough to make money. i feel like ill be stuck working these stupid low wage service jobs forever. i feel like my life is over. i feel even worse thinking about how all my mom wants is a happy and healthy kid. the peace i got earlier when i was driving on the highway, listening to “telephone line” by ELO on full blast thinking about driving into a wall at full speed was the closest to happiness ive felt. i know i will traumatize people by killing myself so i just pray that i get a terminal illness. don’t know if anyone will read this but i just haven’t been able to go to therapy bc of my job and don’t feel like i can be honest with anyone else&lt;/p&gt;

I 33f am married to 37m
We have a little one.

We have been together 11 years.

In the beginning it was great, I was happy, I was in love.

Shortly after having our daughter I developed pretty bad PPD and tried to get help but the meds just made me worse.

We moved far away from family and I was left alone dealing with PPD and an infant 16 hours a day, every day.

During this time living across the country from family, he abused me. It was only the one time, but it’s stayed with me ever since. 

Fast forward to today and I have basically been raising “our” child alone for the past 8 years. I work, but I also do all the work of a SAHM. My child even comes to work with me (which I am grateful was even an option as childcare is not cheap so this was a financial relief.)

I have chronic depression. My earliest memory of me having depression I was 4.
I also over the years developed anxiety and CPTSD from sexual assault.
I go to a trauma therapist and yes it’s working, but I have a lot to work through. My husband knows this and yet provides me no help or relief from my every day tasks.

I cook dinner, he does not. So the trade was he’s to do dishes. They’ll sit in the sink for days, and if I complain, I’m the asshole.

Suddenly our child has started having bouts of severe anxiety and it’s been hard to handle as I cannot get through to her to help her. 
I set up both a doctors appointment and therapy for her. Again, with no input or help from my husband.

Last night as soon as it was bedtime my child started having bad anxiety.
Now I also have a chronic illness that causes me to be in full body pain and aches pretty much 24/7 and it makes me exhausted.  
So when she started I myself started to break down.

I have so much on my shoulders. I do everything for my child, husband, our pets, the home, and I put myself last because I have no other choice.

I got up and went to get my laundry and saw that the stuff I just treated myself to was covered in black ink from a pen my husband left in his pants. And I lost it. It was the straw that broke the camels back.

I had a full on mental break and panic attack.

My husband’s way of consoling me?
“Knock it off and stop fucking up her (out daughter) life!”

I couldn’t believe it. I could not believe he said that to me. After everything I have done and sacrificed for him and our family.
(And for context my daughter is absolutely attached at the hip to me, not him.) it was one of the most hurtful things he’s ever said to me, especially since he knows that with my own mental health I already feel I’m a POS mom for being depressed 24/7

I don’t want to be alive anymore, but I also can’t do that to my baby. The guilt comes in heavy with the mere idea of offing myself because of how often my husband has called me selfish for even having those thoughts as a parent.

I know I of course didn’t give you our full history, but that’s the gist of our relationship. I have retaliated against his words and actions towards me and he knows exactly what to do to gaslight me into insanity.

I want to just leave and start a new life and be in a better head space with my baby, but I financially don’t know how I’d even do that. I also have no family to turn to.

I am stuck and I am depressed to the point of a numbing disassociation.

I am struggling massively with my mental health, to the point of just feeling exhausted and not present, I’m worn out and just done with everything, especially my job. I’m just feeling so lost and a failure in life and it weighs on me.

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for years now, but I’m very high functioning and very good at hiding it,so on the outside, I look perfectly ok, but I just feel like I’m unrevealing now and I don’t even know where to begin to pick up the pieces. I’ve e had counselling and CBT which helped but I still struggle so deeply, I’ve never had medication, I don’t know what to do. My GP is aware of my struggles and put me on the waitlist for NHS talking therapy, but I still on the list.

I dread my job, I work in the public sector/local government in education so it’s very high pressure, heavy caseload. I’ve handed in my notice which is 3 months from now, so I will be leaving soon. I’m going to take a break from working and just focus on my studies and pursue my masters degree, so I haven’t completely left without something lined up.

But Irecently got a complaint from a parent that sent me in a downward spiral with my mental health and from that, I’ve not been right. A family member of mine passed away and that triggered it even further. I wasn’t given bereavement leave by my manager, so I’ve been calling in sick, I’ve been off work sick for a week already due to go back this week.

I have no one to turn to, my manager at work isn’t helpful, she’s lovely but she doesn’t know how to support me whenever I mention I struggle with my mental health. There is no signposting to services that can help at my workplace, there is no ‘how can I help,’ nothing. She isn’t mean, but I dread engaging with her about it. 

My family are not the best to talk about these things so I keep it to myself.

I’ve e had counselling and CBT which helped but I still struggle so deeply, I’ve never had medication, I don’t know what to do. My GP is aware of my struggles and put me on the waitlist for NHS talking therapy, but I still on the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dread my job, I work in the public sector/local government in education so it’s very high pressure, heavy caseload. I’ve handed in my notice which is 3 months from now, so I will be leaving soon. I’m going to take a break from working and just focus on my studies and pursue my masters degree, so I haven’t completely left without something lined up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Irecently got a complaint from a parent that sent me in a downward spiral with my mental health and from that, I’ve not been right. A family member of mine passed away and that triggered it even further. I wasn’t given bereavement leave by my manager, so I’ve been calling in sick, I’ve been off work sick for a week already due to go back this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no one to turn to, my manager at work isn’t helpful, she’s lovely but she doesn’t know how to support me whenever I mention I struggle with my mental health. There is no signposting to services that can help at my workplace, there is no ‘how can I help,’ nothing. She isn’t mean, but I dread engaging with her about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family are not the best to talk about these things so I keep it to myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how to feel better.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it’s better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i’m the same as them, as if we’re all normal, because after all anger is an emotion.

,depression,"I've written this post twice now after taking too long and losing it.  I'm going to be as brief as possible, while still trying to cover everything.  Mainly the advice I need is at the end.

I've been with my (46M) girlfriend (36F) for 3 and a half years.  I haven't been a good boyfriend.  I've lied about some pretty big things, and I've compounded lie on top of lie.  I was previously married in a loveless and toxic marriage that I am still struggling to end, but I lied to her and told her that it was final.  When she asked to see the decree, I continued to lie, delaying the inevitable. She knows now, and even though the divorce arbitration is moving forward, it doesn't fix the lies.

I had a close friendship with someone from my previous job, that was inappropriate.  Really inappropriate.  It wasn't cheating, physically or emotionally, neither of us wanted anything like that, but we did exchange racy and sexual text messages with each other, memes and pornographic pictures from the internet, nothing ever personal, and some of this did overlap into the beginning of my relationship with my girlfriend.  My girlfriend found out and I deleted all the messages from my phone, out of shame, and fear, and disgust with myself.  I forgot that they were even there because it had been so long ago, but once she found one of them, it all came back and I panicked.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to restore them so she can read them all and get closure.

We are trying to work things out, I think most of the work needs to be done by me.  I am in therapy, both personal and couples', trying to be better.  My psychologist wants to diagnose me with Borderline Personality Disorder, but I'm not sure that completely explains everything.  It's a work in progress.  I just want to move forward and I don't want to lie ever again, and I want everything to go back to normal.

That's where the anxiety is.  I overthink and I self-punish.  I go from 0 to 1000 at the drop of a pin and I am inconsolable.  I am terrified that I'm losing her, that I have already lost her, that she's going to find someone else less problematic.  And part of me knows that that probably would be the best thing for her, to be loved by someone that would never lie or hurt her.  It would end me though.  It would completely destroy me.  She tells me that she still loves me, and still wants to be with me, and make this work, but she can never trust me again.  Even if we work through all this, I can't see how she ever could, and I don't blame her.  Not one bit.  And without trust, how can there be love?  Real love?  And in my head, I don't know if she really needs ME or does she just need someone, and am I in the way?  She wants to meet new people, for friendships and I agree that she should.  I think she should get out and find that support system that I'll never be comfortable finding for myself.  She says that she's not looking for dates, or someone new, or even casual throwaway sex to fill the void that I caused, but that fear exists.  I know how special she is, even if she doesn't, and I know other people will see it too.  And I'm going to lose her, if I haven't already.

We have ups and downs.  Some days we are still madly in love and all over each other physically.  Some days are the complete opposite, cold, quiet, filled with hurt.  It's the yo-yo that hurts the worst, and causes the most anxiety.  Waiting for the shoe to drop that she found someone.  That it already happened.  And it's over.  It eats at me inside and I can't seem to make it stop.  I go for days without eating or drinking, sleeping.  I've lost over 15 pounds in two weeks and my clothes don't fit anymore. I just don't know how to stop accelerating things in my own mind, or how to stop hurting myself and focus on trying to fix the here and now.  I was on Paxil 10mg once a day for a while, but they don't work and I'm pill avoidant anyway.  I don't know what to do and I need help and I feel like I don't deserve any.

I've struggled with my mental health in the past but recently, I've made an effort to remain busy, try to find a job and stuff. I think its doing me good, because I don't give myself the time to think like I used to before. 

Now these episodes are more frequent than ever and have started to interfere with my efforts to remain productive.

,depression,"I don’t know how to put this into words but here’s what I’m dealing with:

Severe Misophonia, chronic back pain(unknown cause, dozen of unsuccessful treatments over the course of about 7 years), severe social anxiety- literally zero friends whatsoever, religious disagreement with family, frequent headaches, depression, (thankfully mild most of the time, except every week or so when I get lonely and it smacks me in the face and tells me I have nothing of value to offer to anyone and no future) and no life skills/degree or employment of any kind.

 I have also never had sex/kissed/held hands/been on a date in my life. I can literally only think of one time a girl my age even hugged me.  It was about 7 years ago (when my life was just starting to fall apart) and she only hugged me because she was a very friendly/affectionate kind of person and we happen to be in the same group at Mormon youth conference thing (she hugged everyone goodbye). We barely ever spoke to each other and I don’t even remember her name. 

I have plenty to be thankful for too, or at least I *should* be, but somehow that just makes me feel like I’m even more useless for not being able to get my life together. Anyway the positives are:

Parents (still married and in a good relationship) are supportive with my struggles, other than the religion thing. They’re VERY Mormon/LDS and cannot accept that I don’t believe anymore. (I stopped at around 16).

I managed to get my driver’s license and GED after dropping out of school in 10th grade.(due to the back pain and misophonia)

Good financial situation. Of course I’m completely dependent on my parents(which makes me feel worthless sometimes) while we’re not exactly rich, we’re probably middle to maybe upper middle class, by the standards here in the US. 

Depression is also not quite as bad as it was at 16-17, in large part due to therapy. 

The thing is, all my problems compound on each other. 
Want to get a job? Well I can’t because my back is going to demand I lay down after 30 minutes of sitting, standing or walking. But why try when it’s going to send my anxiety through the roof? And what is someone triggers my misophonia, so I just sitting there, suffering with extreme rage, while my body pumps me full of all the hormones it thinks I need to be prepared for my imminent death?

So what if I work from home then? How many jobs are there that let me work as few and as erratic hours as I need to manage the pain, while also minimizing social interaction? Oh and all I have for my resume is a GED and zero previous employment. 

How do I make friends when I have nowhere to go? No school, college, church or workplace. Not to mention I live in the dead center of the mormoniest part of Utah. I’m instantly going to be an outsider, as an agnostic-ish person. I’m not even anti-Mormon or looking to get into arguments or anything. People aren’t mean about it, but there’s always that slight distance between us.(which my social anxiety insists will ruin everything)

What about friends online? I have had some people I played online games with in the past, and had some I would call friends. But they didn’t last. Like all of my other friendships, they were shallow, I think because I suck at taking interest in other people, and we drifted apart. 

That’s only half the problem though, because my mom dislikes online game relationships . I’m not forbidden from playing games with people online, and she has actual agreed that it could be good for me to interact with people like that. The thing is, I have no privacy. Most of the day, it’s just me and my mom in the house, where she could overhear anything I say, or walk in at any moment. It’s not like I plan on doing anything she would disapprove of, but my anxiety doesn’t care. Even now, if she walks into the room while I’m just watching a harmless youtube video my heart rate spikes. So anytime I try to play online games with people there’s this stress that my mom is listening to and judging everything I say. Not to mention it’s just awkward to have your mom there while you’re trying to hang out with your friends.

The religion thing is at a stable but mutually unsatisfying stalemate. It makes interacting with my siblings awkward, and I usually avoid my extended family as best I can. My parents occasionally preach to me a little and everyday I have to read a page of the Book of Mormon and come to family prayer. I put up with it because they made it clear that those are the rules in this house and I figured it’s the least I can do considering how much they’ve worked to try to help me, not to mention raising me. 

The thing is, I sometimes hate it here. I hate living in this beautiful house with loving parents, free food, free WiFi and minimal responsibilities. I want to do something. I don’t know what because I’m not good at anything and every time I leave I am rewarded with physical and emotional suffering. I’m so socially defunct that I can’t hold a conversation with anyone, not that I get many opportunities to. But even being very inverted I get really lonely when I learn something cool and have no one to share it with, or when I need advice and have no one who can relate to me or when I realize that on my current trajectory, I’ll never fall in love, let alone get married and start a family. 

I’m not sure why I’m posting this, I guess it’s easier to be honest if I’m anonymous. I’ve thought about doing something like this before but I was paranoid that someone I know will find it and know it was me. I am still paranoid, but once I actually wrote this out I decided to just post it anyway. I don’t know if I want pity or advice, or just some actual meaningful human interaction, but every year that passes it gets harder to ignore the fact that I have no idea what I am going to do with my life.

Just these last months have just been hard. My eating disorder has come back aggressively, and I know subconsciously it's my suicide, the suicide I can control. I want to die I don't eat. I want to live I eat. 

 I feel my friends couldn't give a shit about me. My cat ran away and not one friend could be bothered to talk to me to help me through it. I went through a death last year. Same thing not one friend cared. I'm always the back up friend. I'm the friend people only give a shit about when everyone is busy. 

I took a year off of college to get a job but I can't get any job and I've applied for over 20 jobs. I keep seeing articles talking about how no one wants to hire Gen z so now I'm panicking no one will hire me ever.

 So I'm sick of being sick, I feel like none of my friends could care less if I died, I feel like a deadbeat failure that I can't get a job and an idiot because I was at best a C student in school. I know people go through worse so I feel like a bigger POS I feel this way. 

I have a really hard time talking about these things in real life because I either want to avoid this topic like the plague or joke about it like it doesn't bother me.

,depression,"Hi, good morning/afternoon/evening. I'm writing this post to ask for your opinion on my behaviour.

For some months I've been taking SSRIs (Serotonin Recapture Inhibitors) which help me control my mind and depressive thoughts. The ones I take work really well. Although I need to give it a psychological push to keep working sometimes, but that's expected.

Now, I had to stop taking it because of ""reasons"", and my brain has slowly become depressed again, and although I feel sad and depressed more easily, I also feel more... Free, I feel like I am the real me, I feel like I'm really feeling, I'm really in touch with my own feelings and don't feel the need force myself to feel (or even be) a certain way.

With this, the dilemma arises - To be, or to not be depressed? 

While with SSRIs I am more physically free (my body doesn't get anxious as easily, or depressed which leaves me tired and not wanting to do anything, or worse...) and more productive with my life, I also feel like I'm suffocating myself emotionally, because, even though SSRIs do let me feel sad and sometimes even ""depressed"", I still feel like I'm not being the real me, and instead feeling and doing what is expected of me.

Thinking about this scares me a little. Even though, the answer should be obvious, I also think about what's going to happen later in life if I do keep taking these.

It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it’s better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i’m the same as them, as if we’re all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it’s because their so mad at the other person’s opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn’t that mean you’ve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I’m not an object. I definitely take it too far though, punching the wall, screaming, and destroying things are not normal emotions. To top that off, I am stuck in a constant eating disorder, starved until I couldn’t, ate until I exploded, I prefer the skinny side of me, I liked my body at least. Back to sadness… I haven’t been able to explain it to anyone else what im feeling, to explain it on the deepest level I can, what I feel (maybe I’m being dramatic) is death, although I dont know what death feels like I assume its like getting old, or being on your death bed, my depression is like waiting to die, everyday not getting up to do anything, never being happy, not having anyone worry or miss you, that’s what death is overall. I seem normal on the outside, besides my arms (yes I mean that) but that’s only because if I cant even handle the beat down from myself, I dont know what’d I do if I had to endure hate from the outside world, that’s one of the scariest things in my opinion. Truly, if I could, I would cut all my hair off and fix it to my liking, I would tear my face off and stab it until I couldn’t anymore, and pay for a new one, I would melt my body until it could be transformed into something I could bare to look at, I would smush my brain until it could feel all emotions, in a normal way, until it could cure my mental illness(s), but I can’t do that, can I. It’s pretty disappointing that not even death wants to be friends with me, how do I know, from the multiple times I’ve tried to meet them, they declined.

It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it’s better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i’m the same as them, as if we’re all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it’s because their so mad at the other person’s opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn’t that mean you’ve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I’m not an object. I definitely take it too far though, punching the wall, screaming, and destroying things are not normal emotions. To top that off, I am stuck in a constant eating disorder, starved until I couldn’t, ate until I exploded, I prefer the skinny side of me, I liked my body at least. Back to sadness… I haven’t been able to explain it to anyone else what im feeling, to explain it on the deepest level I can, what I feel (maybe I’m being dramatic) is death, although I dont know what death feels like I assume its like getting old, or being on your death bed, my depression is like waiting to die, everyday not getting up to do anything, never being happy, not having anyone worry or miss you, that’s what death is overall. I seem normal on the outside, besides my arms (yes I mean that) but that’s only because if I cant even handle the beat down from myself, I dont know what’d I do if I had to endure hate from the outside world, that’s one of the scariest things in my opinion. Truly, if I could, I would cut all my hair off and fix it to my liking, I would tear my face off and stab it until I couldn’t anymore, and pay for a new one, I would melt my body until it could be transformed into something I could bare to look at, I would smush my brain until it could feel all emotions, in a normal way, until it could cure my mental illness(s), but I can’t do that, can I. It’s pretty disappointing that not even death wants to be friends with me, how do I know, from the multiple times I’ve tried to meet them, they declined. Another thing I hate, is that I can’t be grateful for the things I have, I have a normal life don’t get me wrong, I have a nice house and good amount of money, but what’s so selfish and unfortunate is that I don’t want it, I don’t want this life, say, maybe one day I do get out of this comfort of sadness, happiness makes me uncomfortable, if I do get out of this one day, I’m still going to hate what I have, I hate what I have and what I don’t, that’s why its better off to end it all.

,depression,"Hi all. 

I have struggled with depression and anxiety from the age of 14, I’m 31 this month. 

I have worked since the age of 15 at various different jobs, I finally thought I’d found one now that was okay while I started to apply to study to go forward to apply for a probation officer program. 

My job is becoming stressful, a lot of pressure and I just can’t cope - I feel it’s impacting my mental health again, my anxiety is through the roof and I’m looking to apply for other jobs with less responsibility so I can do my job and head off home after not worrying sick. 

In the last 2/3 years there’s been jobs that have been terrible, I was bullied out of a job because I spoke up about the way things that weren’t right and it’s just destroyed any confidence I may have had. 

I can feel myself spiralling again into crisis like I was at the start of the year and I just don’t know what to do anymore, it’s starting to develop into intense suicidal thoughts with serious intention again. 

I try so hard, I try my best and work as hard as I can and it just feels like it’s never good enough and it always goes wrong. I’m just so tired of it all now, not just how many times I can keep going through this cycle.

I am an angry person. I hate everyone and everything. I have no idea why.

My childhood was good I guess. I feel like my parents did a good job raising me. I wasn’t spoiled but I did have more opportunities than my peers. I am an only child. So I can’t think of any childhood trauma that would cause my anger issues. The only thing that maybe would have anything to do with it is when I was in high school I was the kid everyone picked on but tbh it didn’t really bother me because I didn’t like anyone anyways lol

I didn’t start noticing how much of a hostile person I am until I reached adulthood. At 19 I bought my first home, had a good job, good friend group, etc. I did develop an alcohol problem but got it under control after my DUI when I was 24. I still drink occasionally but only when I’m home. There is no correlation between my anger and alcohol. Just wanted to add that for context on my life. I have the smallest fuse. If someone looks at me the wrong way I’m ready to kill them. I can’t count on my fingers and toes the amount of times I’ve plotted someone’s death in my head. 

I’m now 29 and it’s like the anger is full force. I’m happily engaged to the love of my life and he is literally the best person in the world. He’s very patient and understanding and non judge mental. What’s crazy is I’ve felt like I’ve gotten more angry in the last 3 years we’ve been together. But it has nothing to do with him or anything he’s done. He has a great career as do I so financials aren’t an issue. I used to be an extrovert now I can’t stand to leave the house. I can’t stand to be around people because people are fucking stupid. If someone says something stupid it will send me into a rage. If someone is loud/obnoxious I imagine hurting them. I love the thought of beating the shit out of someone who messes with me.

Here’s where it turns into depression. I will get so mad about something so minute and after I blackout from shear anger I beat myself up because once I calm down I’m embarrassed for myself at how mad I get. I do have a history of suicidal thoughts and 1 attempt (during my alcohol abuse). Generally when I do get angry it doesn’t turn physical. I don’t put my hands on people. It pretty much gets compartmentalized. 

My biggest problem is I don’t have any non religious connections that I can properly seek help from. 

I got extremely angry tonight. I had one of the most violent outbursts I’ve had in a while. It started with my DoorDash order. It was wrong. I got pissed. Then I was playing a video game. Game lagged out and I lost all my progress. Rage quit. Decided to go take a shower because I figured that would make me feel better. Went to wash my hair and I was out of conditioner. I then threw all the bottles out of the shower. My fiancé has a little mirror in the shower and I almost punched it when I saw my reflection. 

I’m to the point where I hate myself. I can’t lose weight because of my hormones I’m on from a hysterectomy in 2019. I’m not an obese person just slightly overweight. My sleep is being affected because of my anger turns depression. I’m too afraid to take sleeping meds because I already don’t hear my alarm clock in the mornings. I’m constantly stressed or mad about something. Those suicidal thoughts are coming back and it scares tf out of me.

At the time I thought it was really funny, but I told somebody else that joke today and they didn't laugh. I asked my friend if she had thought it was funny and she said she did now, but that it had hurt her feelings a little in the moment. Learning that made me feel terrible. 

The other day I told my boss he looked weird in his shirt. I meant to say seeing him in a certain casual shirt was weird cause I'm so used to seeing him dressed as a boss. I felt bad and had to track him down later to apologize and he said he had actually thought it was funny and that he felt bad that I felt the need to apologize. Which made me feel worse like I'd made a situation that wasn't awkward into one that was. 

But the big giant thing is I just ended things with someone I really, really care about and deeply love. This man is really just the best. We were friends first. He's kind, he's loyal, he's funny, he's so generous, and I wanted our relationship to work but I just wasn't feeling it for whatever reason. I ended things as quickly as I realized, and he is taking it really hard. He's a beautiful soul and I never would want to hurt him and now I doubt he'll ever want to be my friend again. 

I just feel like I keep hurting peoples feelings, or if I didn't, I think myself into circles until I convince myself that I did. Or sometimes I REALLY hurt people. I killed a fly the other day and cried about it, because what right did I have to take it's life? But other people don't get so affected in this way. It's exhausting, I don't want to hurt anyone. Honestly. It genuinely makes me wish I was never born. I would so much rather be broken up with than be the person doing the breaking up, because at least in that instance I'm not carrying all this guilt. 

I was thinking of ending my life today and what I would write on the note. ""I don't want to hurt anyone anymore."" But how silly would that be? Because by taking my life, I would be hurting people who love me. And I know there are a few who do, I have a pretty good support system. I just am so tired. I'm so tired of being hurt and of hurting and I have been through a lot in my life and I just don't really want to do it anymore, honestly. But there's no out, I just have to go through it all. I don't mean to sound whiney but god I just really don't want to go through it all.  

I am trying to look at my life as something to cherish. I remember my 7th grade teacher used to congratulate us on our birthdays instead of saying happy birthday, and we all thought it was weird, but sometime near the end of the school year, when someone finally questioned her, she told us ""not everyone makes it to 13. Lots of people don't. You've made it this far, so congratulations!"" And I try to remember that. I'm 26 now (I probably sound a lot younger, sorry you had to read all my whining) and I can picture myself living a whole life, but on top of all the hurt and guilt I feel, there's a lot of anxiety about the state of the world and I don't even know what the future can look like.

I’m getting stressed the hell out on expenses to how I’m gonna pay for college.

,depression,"Hello. I'm 31 years old male from Puerto Rico, and still living with my mother. I wish this wasn't the case, but I don't have any money to buy my own house. I'm also obese at 5'8"" 280 pounds. At times I try to do exercise, but I find it extremely difficult and don't last long. Also, I tell myself that I'm going to start lifting weights, but I have zero motivation and have a hard time concentrating. I always feel like hot garbage, zero energy, sloppy. I've had some ancestors that had cancer, could it be a hereditary disease or something? I've lived a very sedentary life for 11 years.

I feel helpless, I can't sleep at night. I live in a house where they have a car repair shop. I'm willing to work there but constantly find myself distracted and don't do anything.

I wish I had a job that paid me the minimum wage at least, but I live in a somewhat rural area, lots of houses but not many commercial buildings. Everything is 30 minutes away and I don't have a car. I could use some money right now.

What can I do to improve my life? Are there any supplements out there that help with well-being? Maybe I have some type of deficiency that makes me feel like I'm depressed. Perhaps a chemical unbalance in the brain? When I try to sleep at night, I feel like someone is performing an exorcism on me and feel awful.

I know there are supplements out there that could help me, but I have no idea which. I ingest anti-depressants like Ativan, Restoril and Zyprexa. The only thing they do is aid with sleep somewhat.

There are lots of things I want, like a gaming computer and perhaps find a girlfriend, but women like men who are in shape and take care of themselves. I have a hard time brushing my teeth.

I'm convinced there's something wrong with me, but I don't know what it is. My school experience was terrible, I was bullied from middle school, then my parents got divorced right before I entered high school and moved 2 hours away. The last few years of school didn't get much better.

I want to live, be happy and feel good. I'd love to travel a little perhaps, although I'm not a huge fan of traveling, but most importantly, I want to achieve independence.

My dream is to play iRacing. I've always been big on video games, and always aspired to have iRacing since it was released, almost two decades ago. I find it hard to believe that I haven't yet played that game. I'm super scared to talk to people with fears that they're going to make fun of me.

What is wrong with me? I always tell myself, if others can do something, I can do it too.

When I was in high school, I fantasized about being a trans, started doing stupid things with my food, like overeating white rice so my glutes would get bigger. I also made my testicles drop so I could produce more estrogens to look like a woman. Could it be hormonal imbalance? My fapping doesn't feel good at all like it did in high school. I have man boobs as well and my orgasms are super weak. I think I have erectile dysfunction. I am uncircumcised. 

I almost had intercourse with a man in his 60's when I was in high school. Entered his house at least 10 times with intentions of doing it, but never actually did anything. Perhaps that scene gave me some mental trauma? He did touch me a few times, but I was scared and just left the house. I also gave my stepbrother head once when I was 15. Maybe I have a disease or something.

My father was pretty abusive when I was younger, I've always been told to respect older peers, he would sometimes hit me with belts when I did something bad in school. It was super scary; I was always scared of him.

I don't want to get in trouble, I just want to get to the bottom of my issue, assuming there is one. I just want to be happy. I really need to get in shape first if I want to find a woman willing to be with me.

I smoked weed in high school and had a panic attack. My memory of that situation is not very good. I'm not sure if I did something to trigger the panic attack. I may have started doing circles, which made me dizzy, but I'm not sure.

Any supplements or pills out there that could help my well-being? Multivitamins are not doing the trick.

I also experienced jock itch, which I thought was candida albicans. This jock itch thing lasted for more than a decade from 2011 to 2022. It has been gone for almost two years now, but I still may have something down there.

Spanish is my first language. I have family members in California that have decent income, but they don't want me there or even help me at all. My father lives there and I wish I could move with him but it's not his house.

I share all of these things with you to see if we can get to the bottom of my issues.

,depression,"It's like I'm either totally wired in to what I'm doing, or I've checked out and don't know my own name.

Recently I've been wanting to play games with my friends but I just can't do anything besides sleep and work. Even if I sleep I'm so exhausted that I feel sick. Quite often my brain feels like it's on a race track, just endless thoughts spinning around. Other times it's quite and hollow like a cave. I'm pretty sure if someone knocked on my head they could gear the echo.

My mind is burning. It feels like I'm doing nothing right, nothing at all. Every thought I have spins around untill it's awful.

Yet sometimes calling something for what it is doesn’t help identity it.

Recently watched the Bridgerton queen series with my partner 
And this triggered me to acknowledging that I go through episodes of such lows and such highs.

As a young boy, I was such an over thinker. Alone most of my life, found comfort in myself and lived a lot in my own head.
Fast forward to being in my twenty’s
To combat that way of life, I simply didn’t think about what I was doing.
I just did it, with no thought of reprocussion.
This lead me into a dark path

Over the last 3 years I have found ways to get out of that way of life.
I mediate, write, gym, pray.

Yet living more open to feelings and what courses through me can sometimes undermine me.

There’s always this underlying sense of…emptiness and sadness.

I know if I think too much now that really, it hurts me.

How do others go about this?

To live and enjoy, to consciously embrace and reflect yet engage in life in a matter of “doing”?
To avoid this dread that lingers me.

I have friends but no one I’m really that close with or feel comfortable enough to talk to.

All I want is for someone to love me. I was never protected, not even as a child and I hold so much resentment towards my mother for it. My dad’s dead. I have two older sisters but they don’t bother trying. I got dumped six months ago by the only person who noticed how broken I was and he made me feel so safe and cared for, but he is way too good for me and I don’t blame him for leaving.

I never complain. I’m nice to everyone, I don’t have a bad thing to say about anyone, and I do everything I can to support the people I care about but it’s never enough. 
I have no interests. I feel so dull and boring and I have nothing going on in my head. I have such a hard time finding things to talk about. 
I don’t think I’m a bad person but I don’t think I’m a good person either.
I spend all day alone and my mom doesn’t even check in on me. No one ever asks me how I am.

I started self harming again this year, the only person who’s seen my scars was a guy I was seeing  for a couple of months and I thought he cared.
I’ve starved myself to the point where I’m at least ten pounds underweight, I weigh as much as I did when I was 12 and no one notices, or if they do they just don’t care. 
I’m afraid of letting anyone else in because I’m so ashamed of myself and I can’t deal with being abandoned again but I want nothing more than to be close with someone. I will never be good enough.
I just want to be loved. I want someone to notice I’m not okay. I need someone to take care of me.

,depression,"I don't know where to turn. I'm so damn lost and need help.. I think I may be clinically insane. I don't know. I have real bad anxiety and PTSD as well as depression and I am extremely sensitive. This whole thing is getting to the point that I might eventually unalive myself. It sucks when even your family doesn't want you around because of it. They feel like they are stuck with me. I'm being cut off because of this and only people who seem to care are my friends. I've had a rough childhood and what makes matters worse is the fact that my family was the cause of it and now they want to throw me away. 

When I was two I had to step on glass just to get their attention to see if they loved me. 

When I was expelled from middle for making a threat for being bullied I was punished and for almost a year. Anything I said or did lead to more punishment.

My grandmother tried pushing me down the stairs calling me an ungrateful child. 

My mother has called me a burden and wished I was never born. 

When my step father hit me in the face she was mad at ME. 

I tried to kill myself when I was 17. Instead of my mom trying to figure out what was wrong she yelled at me. 

I've been suffering for so long and my family KNEW something was wrong with me. Instead of being proactive they just let it fester and now that it has gotten this bad they refuse to deal with me. 

What hurts is that NONE of them will tell me the truth. Even when I ask. They will tell me I'm over thinking only to literally talk shit about me for HOURS on in about how crazy I am about how sick I am. Forget all the bad shit they have ever done to me right.

i understand that this isn't like doctors diagnosis or anything, this is reddit for goodness sakes. i just wanna hear like public opinion 

so couple things:
a. i lost passion in things i used to love (reason being i'm not good enough)
b. too lazy/no motivation or drive to even try to get good at the things i say i'm not good enough at

1. i hate my friends all of a sudden. (Not all of a sudden it's been a gradual climb. it's just like all their little quirks just set me off. i can't handle their entire personality) 
i have been friends with them for a while so maybe i just grew out of them? 
2. i kinda am disliking my family. not my family, just my siblings. (i'm the youngest and all my siblings are highly accomplished so i have a big gap to fill in. i feel like i have no personality and only my older siblings exist. i just hate how i'm constantly compared to my siblings and have nothing that they can compare to. I DONT HATE MY SIBLINGS. i hate that i get compared to them)
maybe all normal siblings hate each other? also maybe it's an inferiority complex thing idk. 
3. i really just hate myself for being all these things. (I feel like i have no true reason to hate any of my friends or siblings. they all are great people but for some reason i can't handle them. I just don't understand why i hate them so violently. it just makes me feel like a disgusting shitty horrible person.)

,depression,"Life just fucking sucks right now. And I need help, advice, comfort, anything honestly. 

To start, my mom was recently diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. That alone is rough to deal with. And shortly after that the love of my life left me. And shortly after that, my own aunt let me go from my job because they were downsizing. So now I’m dealing with the possibility of losing my mom, the worst heartbreak I can imagine, and unemployment. And after all this hit me I got a 6 figure job offer and thought maybe this is all apart of God’s plan and I’m about to receive a huge blessing. The job offer fell thru and now im unemployed and running out of money. So that’s what’s been going on in my life recently. 

I was with my ex when I found out my mom had cancer and she looked into my soul and told me “you will never have to worry about being alone ever again” and I bawled my eyes out in her arms. She left 2 weeks later. We had the most intimate, deep, and loving connection I thought anyone could have. We were best friends. I fully planned on marrying this girl. I had a ring picked out and everything. We also had promise rings if that adds any value tho this whole thing. I was living with my parents when we started dating, she lived an hour away. I drove 2 hours a day in bad big city traffic in a car that gets like 15 miles to the gallon for idek how many months. So I moved out of my parents house to be closer to her, that’s how serious I was. Pretty much all of my money went to her, whether that be random gifts, food, gas and other things. I know she didn’t ask for all that but I’m just saying that to let you know how serious I was. When we broke up she said she started having doubts early in the relationship, but she still led me on and drew me closer and closer. She would plan our future and promised so many things to me. I had trust issues from past relationships and other things in life and just as I was getting over those, she left me and told me that she knew it probably wasn’t going to work. I don’t think I will ever be able to trust someone again if I’m being honest. There’s more things I could say about her and more things I found out but I don’t want to waste any more of your time. 

Life is just beating the living fuck out of me right now and I’m tired of it. I fight the urge to kill myself everyday. Idk if I will or not. I’m just waiting to see if I’m gonna get more shit thrown at me or if something good will happen to me for once.

If you read all of this thank you. I hope this wasn’t a bore or a waste of your time. 

Edit: Another thing to add, the only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I’m scared to face God’s judgement. And I’m still scared so I probably won’t kill myself for that reason. Plus, I have some hope that I will be happy and at peace one day and I bet that’s gonna feel good so I’m not gonna give up and quit.

I remember being small and tiny and crying after, it really hurt. I think he learned it from my dad since he would hit me and my sister too, but again it was much harsher on me and when my sister and I would go to visit and would tell our mom and she would get on his ass about how excessive he was. I remember when he hit my 4 year old half sister for walking in the parking lot when we were supposed to get in the car, she was just a baby. His mom is also like that, she would favor my sister and buy her food and clothes and id just have to tag along since she couldn’t leave me home, she always wanted a daughter but never had one. One time she hit cause i jumped over the couch cause I didnt want to get infront of the tv to intercut her show and she got a belt and whooped me for 2 minutes, my sister came to me after when i was crying and called my mom to pick us up. I dont go to visit often since then and have never stayed for more than a week since. Most of the time my brother would hit me i wouldnt tell my mom since nth would happen and he would just b mad. It didnt stop until i had the intention to kill him and tried stabbing him which he beat me down and told my mom and he stopped after.

 I tried talking to my mom about it but she just says its normal brother stuff and how her younger brother would fight with her, its not the same at all. They dont know whats it like to be that little and skinny and the way it hurts and crying cause all you wanted was to have fun but they wanted to punish me. She said im just supposed to move past it but those people arent my family, ive never felt loved by them only tolerated. I dont like them at all and they just think im a pussy. I dont think im overreacting, this isnt normal right. All my mom has to say is she tried her best as a single mother and thats it and she’s sorry i feel this way. It wasnt just the hitting, the verbal abuse of being reminded how ugly i was made really insecure about myself, i didnt do well in school and would get called things but it would always be “jokes”. Kids would laugh and say things about my skin, then id have to go home and hear the same thing. Im moreno and my family would just say things just reinforcing how lesser than human I really am.

,depression," Crazy-? 

 I’ve been an outcast my entire life. In my family, with friends, school, anywhere I go it feels like I’m pinned against a wall. They look at me as if I’m not human- my mom said she could tell someone I’m special needs and they wouldn’t question it, she has to understand that’s hurtful right?

Growing up I was outgoing and loud, in my family I was categorized with my cousin, we were “the weird kids”, my cousins would make fun of him when he wasn’t around and I know they did the same with me. They have called me childish for as long as I can remember, but obviously I was childish I was a fucking child. As I grew up I got quieter, anxious and terrified of disappointing people. I had some not so great relationships and friendships that made me feel crazy. I was 12 when these things started happening, dated someone that was not good for me to say the least. Started hurting myself in 7th grade because of them, broke up after almost  5 months and I spent the next 2 years yearning for their attention, for them to love me the way I loved them. They used me to take out all there anger, they were so nice when we met, an amazing friend but as soon as we dated they became hurtful and cold. Treated everyone around me kindly and me like total shit. A couple months after we broke up I got close to him, a person I can’t bare to see. He laughs and makes gag noises when he sees me as if I was the problem- he lied to me through our entire relationship, made up people and story’s. Told me that he had certain things in his closet, hurtful things- said his dad hit him and even made up 3 fake friends to trick me into things. I knew he was lying I’m not an idiot but I “loved” him. We were on and off for months and I honestly can’t remember all the horrible things he made me do because they are so far repressed into my mind. I remember one night in particular tho, I wish I could forget it- I was at his house and we were hanging out having a good time, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and told me he wanted to “try something” he gave me the knife and took off his shorts and told me to cut him. he said that he was into it and when I said I didn’t want to he said I didn’t love him. He claimed I had been lying to him and if i loved him id do it, so I took the knife and did what he said-  to make it even worse this little girl from across the street was there, he had her sit in the closet before it happened. she was 9, a fucking 9 year old. he's the one that made my self harm even worse, he made me start vaping, drinking, made me do things- he used to claim that he couldn't kiss me because of his braces which obviously I knew was a lie but I was to scared to ask him why he really wouldn't kiss me- ofc now i know its because he never actually loved me. one of the last nights i was at his house was the worst tho, he had made me do so many things before that night and i knew what was next. I had never had sex with anyone before, people talk about how there first time was special or amazing but mine was horrible- so horrible i barley remember it, he didn't want to touch me he only wanted me to touch him as he had the entire relationship. I didn't want to but I did because I thought he'd fall in love with me somehow. after that night we broke up completely and haven't talked since. No one knows about the things that happened with him, no one cares- we only broke up because the first abusive partner texted me, they said they loved me and wanted to be with me so I ended it with him. A week or two later they decided they hated me again, them along with my other “friend” texted me they hated me that new years along with a lot of other messages about how horrible I was, and both blocked me. A month later the other friend reached out and we began talking again, then my ex also reach out and everything was “fine” I started dating this person during that time, they were sweet but also not and our relationship didn’t last long because that February my ex texted me again. They came over and we had a night that we called “long hug night” we sat in my room and hugged for hours not saying anything, we were high and crying and we felt close. They said they wanted to kiss me but since I was dating someone I told them it couldn’t happen. A week later on April fools night I broke up with my boyfriend to be with them and a week after that they got cold again- we stopped talking after I yelled at them for doing that again and a month later I found out they were dating my friend. During all of this the ex-friend that joined my ex in hating on me for new years had gotten rather close to me, I found out they liked me and one Wednesday at a friends house we kissed. The next week he came over and we had a great time, at one point we kissed again and made out which from my knowledge was completely ok because he didn’t tell me he didn’t want to and we had kissed the week before. 3 days later I found out he told a bunch of our friends that I sexually assaulted him. Everyone was against me and I lost almost all of my friends over a lie- I have been SA and I would never do that to someone else. Back to the girl and my ex though, I only found out they were together because they broke up and after they did I felt bad for my friend and asked if she wanted to see a movie with me to cheer her up, we got close and started dating and I bet you know we’re this leads. She claimed to be a “lesbian” but since I am trans and identify as a male she wasn’t one, she got mad at me for mentioning top surgery and continued to say she was lesbian while dating a trans man. After a bit I lost connection because of this and I broke up with her and 2 months later on October 1st to 6th my sister got in a car accident and died. She was 16, and I was 14. I couldn’t believe it- ofc during this that ex-friend that cost me nearly all of my friends showed up again, he apologized for the things he said and told people and wanted to be friends again. Since we had mutual friends we got closer and I thought it was behind us until he got cold months later and screamed at me. During the October my sister died I got close to this girl, scarlet, she was kind and sweet and she dressed up as Garfield for Halloween. That December we kissed while watching tinkerbell and started dating January 15th 2023. I have nothing bad to say about her because it’s currently july 14th 2024 and our year and a half is tomorrow. I love her more than worlds can describe. 

But even with the girl I want to marry someday I still feel crazy. I hate myself more than I thought possible and everyday is weighing on me. Although to everyone else around me it looks like nothings happening I’m crumbling. Struggling to wake up each morning and not scream at myself. I have diagnosed ADHD and anxiety along with so many other issues that are tearing me apart. My girlfriend thinks I have an eating disorder, people I’ve talk to think I have autism or am bipolar, and everyone else thinks I’m crazy. I’m 16 man- I’m just a kid. All I can think about is how badly I hate everything I do. I have no dreams, no future plans, no hope. I’m terrified of driving, I don’t have a job, I have nothing. It feels like everyone hates me, and if they don’t now they will. I can’t stop hurting myself or getting high or eating to much or starving myself. I know change starts with me and no one else can fix this but I don’t know how to. I’m a fat, ugly, tranny that my parents don’t even want. They want their little girl but she died a long time ago and if they’re not careful they’ll lose their boy too. I’m this close to ending it all, I can’t keep living like this. I’m tired of carrying this burden, I’m tired of being such a burden to people that I love. I can’t stop being terrible, it feels like that’s all I’ve ever been. Like I deserve everything that’s happened to me- I’m suicidal, homicidal, and I need real help that I can’t get. I wish for something horrible to happen to me because just maybe they’ll care and realize I wasn’t fucking playing around. I’m serious and I’ve always been serious- maybe I am crazy  ",t2_o3y7vclr4,False,,0,False,Crazy? ,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e3lq5e,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1721016864.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crazy-? &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello.

I am a 31 year old female. All of my life I have suffered from severe inattentive ADHD and depression.  Victim of a narcissistic toxic family, labeled the black sheep. FF to my adult life. Survivor of domestic violence, then later unrelated a violent rape. 2 years ago now almost 3 I lost custody of my son. He is 9 now.  I see him every Wednesday, Friday, and every other Saturday. The coparent is a narcissist who is extremely controlling and if it is not their way its no ones way. Always in the public eye, the one with the most money, never follows the order, constantly filling my child's head with manipulative bullshit. When its good its great but it always fleeting always temporary.     Over the past 9 years so many times I  have thought about finality.    I won't elaborate on that I think most of you can understand it.   

  
I want to change. I am so tired of living life this way. I am constantly physical exhausted, agitated, or just ready to give up.  The only time I feel any shred of happiness is when I am with my son or get to hear his voice on the phone. He is the only thing that keeps me going.   I am a first responder.  I am in RN school.   I start in August.   I want to get on a medication to help with my ADHD so that I can focus but also a medication that will help with my depression giving me energy, purpose and drive to get up and DO things throughout the day. On top of everything I severe anxiety.   I have tried so many different medications and want to know if anyone has any recommendations.   I am well aware that everyone is different and everyone responds differently.  I am going to respectfully ask the reddit community to not comment things like ""You need to talk to your doctor"" or ""Everyone responds to medication differently"".  I want to know what works for you.   I am going to list the medications that I have tried here and the side effects that I have had: 

Strattera-Currently on it. Not giving up just yet. Seriously bad anxiety. 40mg

Vyvanse: 20mg love it until it starts to wear off. Hype focusing. Make just get back on it.

Lexapro: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Trileptal: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Prozac: Giddy, would laugh inappropriately which happens to me a lot on antidepressants. 

Zoloft: Giddy, would laugh inappropriately. (This is for the first 2 weeks of most antidepressants with me. Its embarrassing and I work in direct patient care. I cannot be like this at work period.

Effexor XR: Very bad depression and a serious almost police involved attempt.

Trintellix: Bitchy and agitated

Cymbalta or Duloxetine: Serious anxiety for the first month of taking to the point where I had to get off.

Citalopram: Have been on it. Don't really remember it but I think anxiety.

Bupropion or Wellbutrin XR:  Bitchy and lightheaded. Did not really give it the best trial run. 

Lamictal: So aggressive and agitated that a trip to the ER and handcuffed to a chair

Geodon: Made me fall asleep in my food

Latuda: Craved sweets constantly 

Abilify: Made me slur my speech, crave sweets, felt sedated

Depakote: Made me slur my speech, rock back and forth, agitated

Topamax: Made extremely anxious, forget where I was going in traffic and literally how to drive

Caplyta: Crave sweets, weird dreams, crying spells

Clonazepam(Klonopin) Currently take PRN

Ativan: Serious memory issues.

Xanax: Depression.

Buspirone: Very bad headache did not manage anxiety effectively

Vistaril: Laughable did absolutely noting for my anxiety. Made my nose extremely dry. 

Those are all of the ones that I remember taking.  I need recommendations based purely on what has worked for others on antidepressants and ADHD medication.

My life is pretty simple. I wake up, i go to school (not for now lol), i come home, i play videogames, i have dinner, i play videogames, i go to sleep. Every day. I've tried lots of sports and hobbies, but still i didn't find a passion, and I'm starting to lose hope in finding it.
And the fact is... That i both like and hate my life. I know i'm wasting my life saying at home doing nothing, but i never have the energies to get out of this trashy routine. if i start something, it's because it happens, in a way or another. 

I just broke up with my gf because she was basically flirting with her friends and she gave me very little attention compared to how much i cared about her, and now i'm sure i can't be loved anymore.

I get extremely anxious whenever I think about studying, am studying or when I know that I have to go back to uni soon. I haven’t been able to sleep well, so I often wake up depressed. It’s not that I have trouble falling asleep but I get depressing dreams or nightmares. Everytime anything related to my course or university pops up whether it’s an advertisement, part of a TV series, movie or I overhear conversations, I get rly anxious.

I’ve been crying almost everyday and been trying to get my mind off things, but I still struggle a lot. Tbh, I have thought about seeing a psychologist again but just the thought of making appointments and finding time to actually talk already gives me anxiety.

I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they’re the only thing keeping me going. And while they’re away my dog is going to the kennels because I can’t even look after her by myself.

,depression,"Hi all,

Pretty much done with life rn. One thing people often mention, but I do not think emphasize enough, is how badly depression feeds into itself. 

I went all in on my last relationship of 3.5 years. I got depressed like 8 months in (not her fault) and slowly kept burning all kinds of bridges around me. 

When she decided her bridge was no longer meant for me, I realized I am a completely solitary island now. 

Was I fine with it for awhile? Yea. Do I still feel safe when I’m alone? Yea. But anyone who’s been here will tell you deep down they wish they had a support system but it’s so difficult to start from scratch. 

It’s wild how easily I made friends when I *already had* tons of friends. same with women.

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much done with life rn. One thing people often mention, but I do not think emphasize enough, is how badly depression feeds into itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went all in on my last relationship of 3.5 years. I got depressed like 8 months in (not her fault) and slowly kept burning all kinds of bridges around me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she decided her bridge was no longer meant for me, I realized I am a completely solitary island now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was I fine with it for awhile? Yea. Do I still feel safe when I’m alone? Yea. But anyone who’s been here will tell you deep down they wish they had a support system but it’s so difficult to start from scratch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s wild how easily I made friends when I &lt;em&gt;already had&lt;/em&gt; tons of friends. same with women. &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I've really been trying fix my life

I've made so many mistakes and at times I feel like I'm not good at anything.

I wasn't good in school

I tried going into the military. To get college money, try to get motivated into being a better person, get into better shape, and have time to figure out what I wanna do in life.

Reality wise, I wasn't good at it, was even more depressed and fell into a cycle of barely passing my fitness while also getting more demotivated and still had no idea what I wanted out of life.

So after 4 years I knew I wasn't a good fit for this role and would have eventually been kicked out so I wanted get out, get a regular paying security guard gig as a temporary thing to do something easy while I figure things out.

fast forward 6 years later, mediocre pay with a crappy job and I'm not any closer to figuring out my life than I was at 18 when it was time to get a job and try to make something of my life.

So I asked my dad for some advice. He gave me a couple ideas, one leading into HVAC technician.

Seemed like something I could get into.

I used my GI bill, went to school, got training and everything seemed great. Then I tried applying to jobs but no one would hire me

Got a job at Circle K maintenance, cause they made it seem like they needed people with experience in plumbing, electrician, and HVAC. But reality wise I'm not doing anything HVAC related (they keep telling me they wanna do that eventually but I don't know if eventually is 5 months or 5 years)

So after 6 months of being a glorified janitor, I try applying for other jobs again

Got an interview for an actual HVAC company only to find out how little I actually know of the field and how much competition there actually is.

Its gotten to the point where any choice I make I feel like I'll never make something of myself, I feel like no matter what I do I keep fucking up and keep failing

I feel like no matter how many times I try to climb out of this hole, the hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper and I just keeping slipping to the bottom.

And what if I get into the HVAC industry and I'm not even good at it, like how I'm not good at anything.

,depression,"I haven't really told or opened up like this to anyone but after seeing people open up on here and the support, I thought I could try as well. 

I'm \[19F\] currently starting my second sem of uni and honestly...its not going how I planned at all. I failed three courses, am eating horribly and generally not feeling like myself anymore to the point where I don't even want to eat, drink or do anything cuz it makes me sick to my stomach at the fact that I...am alive? idk how to describe it. My moods constantly change so fast it's like getting whiplash, I can't face my peers without being revolted in myself and honestly...im so tired of feeling like this. My family are disappointed in my behaviour and my friends try to help but it's just them being like 'don't take it too seriously' or 'oh no, you're fine'. I can't listen to music or find any entertainment anymore cuz this stress is just eating at my brain like a damn parasite and I absolutely hate it.

I tried searching up these things online everything says I might have depression or anxiety but I guess in my mind I don't want to accept that cuz if I do the reality of it all sinks in. In my culture it's kinda taboo talking about mental health and stuff so my family tries to help but it's mostly just 'people have it worse than you', 'stop being dramatic', and the classic 'it's your phone that's the problem'. Part of me knows they are right but it doesn't really help. Im still 19 and can't secure a job, not very open and social and now I have to worry about some immigration issues or else my whole family could risk getting deported. 

Basically, my dad has been trying to secure a stable resident status abroad for almost a decade now and failed. And since we are considered immigrants here, we've been living as international people the whole time- despite living here for 10 years by 2025. It's honestly drained our whole family to the point where we haven't even gone out to a restaurant to eat or enjoyed life for so long. My parents fight constantly and I have to put everything aside to mediate them and be the therapist for everyone since I was 10. But now that I'm considered an adult and have finished primary and high school here, I have a chance at changing it all and gaining residency for my family. 

Naturally, I'm ecstatic that I can finally do something about this situation but with everything else, I'm so scared that I'll screw this up too. My dad says I should take a gap year and secure this, since the process might take about three years but I'm already enrolled and have started 2nd year of uni. I've been trying to find the course I need to do while juggling uni but the intakes available are only in Jan 2025 and it makes me even more hopeless cuz by then I'll already be 20, while my friends are all way ahead of me and thriving. I honestly just feel stuck in my life and even after I tried to stay positive and not take things too seriously, it still weighs me down so much mentally and emotionally.

I feel like everything I do fells apart and nothing is going my way.


I have never been in a relationship and since last year I started to develop feelings for a girl who is also my colleague. Recently I confessed her but she said she doesn't have any feelings for me.
Now I don't know what to do I can't get over her and the only this comes to my mind is her.

My family is also pushing me to get married but due to this girl I am not in a mood to get into relationship with any other girl or to get married.

Now due to office politics my growth is stopped and the pay is average.
I always get into an argument with my boss and this is also affecting me.
I am trying to switch jobs but for every company I apply I don't even hear back from them.


I have also going through some financial crunch too. My salary just vanishes, even if I try to be more careful with my money, something will come up and i will runout of the money by end of the month.


2-3 years ago I came to know that my father had an affair with someone close to my family. My father and mother are married for like 35 years. The relationship my parents have is like a relationship of compromise.
They just pretend they are partners but they just don't have love for each other.
I check phone of my father every now and then and I notice my father even texts to that women even now.


Due to this I don't want to get married,just for the sake of getting married...

And the girl I love doesn't love back..

moving on to my sister: shes somewhat social. she hit puberty over half a year ago. she completely changed her looks. she started wearing black, baggy clothes and spends one hour doing full face make up, which our family wasnt so happy of, including me, since it was so sudden and she doesnt even need it. but honestly i dont care about these things. anyway, she has a couple of friends but ive heard she has gotten into a fight with one of them which she has mentioned a couple of times to me and my family but we kinda brushed it off since she didnt really wanna talk about it either. then she has gotten a boyfriend, whom she broke up with 2 weeks later into the relationship because he cheated. and honestly she didnt seem affected by it, i think its clear why. 

main thing she does is keep her room really messy. like insanely messy. about 5 hrs age there was leftover food on the floor, flies everywhere, sticky desk, make up stains everywhere and so on.... my dad were obvously not happy. he came and had a meltdown about her room. yesterday and today to the point where he took her phone. i could tell my sister was upset cuz she didnt go out at all, only to the bathroom for like 5mins. and this happens quite often. i can relate to this aswell, i could even say its normal in our family to get yelled at this much for our rooms but its really apparent she doesnt take it well. on top of that my parents tell everyone INCLUDING ME that she has an ""additue"" and she needs to fix it. but its just her being upset for my dad contantly yelling at her. theres many other things id mention but it would be too much. and on top of that, one of her friends moms told our mom that my sister and her friend were talking about how shes self harming, how she feels worthless ect. and its just so weird to me, why are u spying on my sister? and after that incident she has been wwearing a hoodie for the past 2 weeks. keep in mind its really hot where we live. and its just overall unusual.

  
anyway, i dont use tiktok, snd she does every day. so i had the random thought to check out her account, and it was full of depressed stuff. she was talking about how in her mind, shes fat,and she should stop eating less, or how she was hurting herself and had suicidal thoughts just because our parents got mad because she didnt clean her room. and thats when i got the idea of telling this to someone, because i seriously dont know how to approach this. maybe i should tell my mom, since shes more understanding than my dad. but talking to my sister wouldnt be a great idea since like i said, im still healing from my own things. i dont know how to confort people let alone my sister that im not that close with to this extend.

,depression,"I thought I was stable. I wasn't. 

I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

,depression,"For the first time in my life, I am overweight and extremely depressed. I’m in treatment. I go about twice a week, but I don’t have my own car. I’m 31. I’m single I don’t have any friends. I was born with chronic allergies. I have 30+ I have EOE I have asthma. I have digestive issues. I live in a small town. I can barely go anywhere. I can’t work and my treatment is dragging their feet on helping me get disability. There are some days where I can’t even get myself out of bed and I just piss in a bottle. and I’m not even overweight. I’m just around 200 pounds.  And it’s different for me because most of my life I weighed 160.. I’m stuck in a house with smokers and it doesn’t help my asthma, but it’s literally the only place I could go without being on the street. Hopeless, I feel like I’ll never be good enough for anybody even though I try and remind myself that those are mine traps and I need to try and be positive. I just can’t do it. I say I can’t do it. I don’t like a cop out there times I’ve sat for hours at a time trying to think myself out of my depression. There’s been so many times I’ve told myself OK this is what the situation is. I just need to accept that and find something good about it and no matter how many times I try and do that I end up back at square one. Feel like I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know. I don’t really have any family. I mean, I have my mom and she’s helping take care of me but we have for the most part of pretty terrible relationship. My brother doesn’t speak to me and none of my extended family is in communication with me and I think it’s partially because, I was never really around them that much so it just normally happened that I went through my life without being around them. I mix and I live in a town that pretty racist. Not to mention everybody in this house things the lgbt is an agenda and gossips behind each others backs. I wanna get away from it all but idk how, and I’m burnt out on hope there’s no more hope left in me.. I’m just kinda here, I’m not suicidal I’m just stuck..

I’m in treatment. I go about twice a week, but I don’t have my own car. I’m 31. I’m single I don’t have any friends. I was born with chronic allergies. I have 30+ I have EOE I have asthma. I have digestive issues. I live in a small town. I can barely go anywhere. I can’t work and my treatment is dragging their feet on helping me get disability. There are some days where I can’t even get myself out of bed and I just piss in a bottle. and I’m not even overweight. I’m just around 200 pounds.  And it’s different for me because most of my life I weighed 160.. I’m stuck in a house with smokers and it doesn’t help my asthma, but it’s literally the only place I could go without being on the street. Hopeless, I feel like I’ll never be good enough for anybody even though I try and remind myself that those are mine traps and I need to try and be positive. I just can’t do it. I say I can’t do it. I don’t like a cop out there times I’ve sat for hours at a time trying to think myself out of my depression. There’s been so many times I’ve told myself OK this is what the situation is. I just need to accept that and find something good about it and no matter how many times I try and do that I end up back at square one. Feel like I don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know. I don’t really have any family. I mean, I have my mom and she’s helping take care of me but we have for the most part of pretty terrible relationship. My brother doesn’t speak to me and none of my extended family is in communication with me and I think it’s partially because, I was never really around them that much so it just normally happened that I went through my life without being around them. I mix and I live in a town that pretty racist. Not to mention everybody in this house things the lgbt is an agenda and gossips behind each others backs. I wanna get away from it all but idk how, and I’m burnt out on hope there’s no more hope left in me.. I’m just kinda here, I’m not suicidal I’m just stuck..

A lot of what I see on here i more normal I worry that what I’m about to say isn’t or that I will be judged. Please I just want help.

I have homicidal thoughts. I hate it. I hate most that I could do it and possibly get away with it. On a metric scale I’m attractive. So I know I could get them to follow me and do as I say till they realize what’sabout to happen. For background I was abused severely when put into the care of my aunt for a few years. I was sexually abused and was having hard drugs tested on me regularly by her boyfriend. After going back to my parents life was better until my dad passed. Watching him die in the street was the hardest thing I’ve had to endure. My homicidal thoughts began as nightmares I would see people bleeding out but never be able to make out any distinct features. It quickly escalated as I began hunting animals like deer. It went to intrusive thoughts about harming strangers, most of them had nothing in common except the fact that they where men. After meeting my friend we’ll call her Lilly it stopped momentarily. Until she committed. After that it was stronger than before. It became an itch burried in my skin I couldn’t reach, id try to scratch it till the skin was falling off it quickly became something that caused se me to almost twitch even in public. And the thoughts became more gruesome, I’d think of setting them loose in the woods and hunting them. I made a list of all the sex offenders in my city and watch them when I can. Staring at them and stalking. Hunting. There where moments if I staved myself enough that I didn’t feel the urge as much do to pure exhaustion. I’m introverted but do well socially so when I reconnected with my highschool friend who well call j it stopped for a moment just like with Lilly. I’m some ways he reminds me of her in his own way. The feeling of safety and comfort. After a while we confessed we had feeling for each other but due to his religion we didn’t and haven’t so much as kissed. And in someways I think that’s something I love about our situation. That it’s pure. Recently my thoughts have been coming back resulting in SH to try to stop them. I love him just like I did Lilly.

My looks also play a part, I am extremely unsettling to look at, and I do not have the best personality either as mentioned. I have so many imperfections I don&amp;#39;t even look human, no matter how much I try to see it. I feel like I disgrace the world just by existing. To add fire to the fuel, I don&amp;#39;t have any good talents, I don&amp;#39;t sing, or dance, and the best I could do is get an above-average grade in the class. It bothers me how I can be &amp;quot;good&amp;quot; but can&amp;#39;t be the &amp;quot;best&amp;quot; in academics. The only passion I have is reading, I love to read. But of course, all good things come to an end, and I have been little by little reaching a slump. I don&amp;#39;t know what to feel. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like I am a body without a soul. Maybe I have been programmed this way my whole life, I cannot think of a single trauma that can cause this. I don&amp;#39;t know what I did in my past life to end up in this state. I truly believe I am better off dead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to pity me and I don&amp;#39;t expect anyone to. I just wanted to get this off my chest and share my experience. To those who are experiencing the same thing, know you are not alone.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi everyone,

I am a 16-year-old female, and I’ve noticed some significant issues with myself. Unfortunately, I can't get a proper diagnosis because my parents are against it. Here are the problems I've been facing:

1. Academic Performance: I used to excel in academics until the 10th grade, scoring 95% in my exams. However, this was below my expectations, leading to burnout. Since then, I've subconsciously put in less effort, resulting in a significant drop in my grades in the 11th grade. Even when I try, it doesn't seem to be enough. I now experience extreme exam anxiety, which causes me to freeze and lose focus during exams, despite knowing the material.

2. Action Paralysis: I often find myself unable to start tasks, even when I want to and know I need to. Deadlines pass, and I’m unable to take action, which has severely impacted my productivity.

3. Attention Issues: My ability to pay attention has deteriorated significantly. I struggle to focus on anything for long periods, and this has been an issue for a while but has worsened recently.

4. Emotional Numbness: For the past year, I’ve felt emotionally numb and detached from everything in life. I don’t feel happiness, sadness, or any strong emotions, positive or negative. I also struggle to care about anything, which makes me feel worse, but I don’t even care about feeling worse.

5. Anxiety and Disorganization: My anxiety attacks have intensified. I frequently lose items, am very messy, and often disconnect from conversations, going blank for a while. I’ve lost interest in activities I once enjoyed, like working out. My daily routine, which used to drive me, now lacks structure and consistency.

6. Chronic Fatigue: I am always tired, regardless of how much rest I get.

Despite multiple attempts to improve my situation and get my grades back up, I keep failing to stick to my commitments and feel all over the place.

Can anyone offer advice or help on how to manage these issues?

,depression,"I don’t even know where to start.
I am in my late 20s and for the longest time, I have not been able to do much with my life or accomplish anything. 
A little background, I was good until highschool, I did more or less well academically and was pretty academically inclined, was considered smart and everything. The problem started when I finished highschool, I took a few years off(because of some issues) so I started college late, it already took a toll on my confidence and I felt too old and too late for everything. 

Eventually I finished college and I haven’t been able to accomplish anything else eversince. 
I blamed it all on my laziness, I rationalised myself blaming my failures on my laziness and lack of trying. 
But since last year, I really made a conscious effort to try. I really did try so hard mentally to focus on the task at hand, made small goals to accomplish, made a routine for myself. But I noticed that I could never focus on anything for more than 20 mins at most. Even though I would make a mental note to not let anything distract myself, I would find myself hours later being distracted by the smallest of things and would feel like shit for having wasted all those time and it would repeat all over again. 
I tried to lock my phone up somewhere far away from my room thinking it was the source of my distraction but my mind would still find something else to waste my time on. It became a mental torture at this point. 
It seems like I would rather do literally anything else than the task at hand it doesn’t even have to be enjoyable at that point. 
It’s like my mind has another mind of its own and i lose control of it. 
This has caused me some major distress. 

Another thing i’ve noticed that, nothing feels natural and comfortable to me. 
For example, even when i’m doing a simple task of doing laundry, holding my clothes or the jar of detergent feels uncomfortable and unnatural to me, like i’m not holding it properly or something. Everything I do feels wrong and uncomfortable. 


I just really need some perspective on this because i can’t access therapy at this point.

,depression,"I don’t even know where to start.
I am in my late 20s and for the longest time, I have not been able to do much with my life or accomplish anything. 
A little background, I was good until highschool, I did more or less well academically and was pretty academically inclined, was considered smart and everything. The problem started when I finished highschool, I took a few years off(because of some issues) so I started college late, it already took a toll on my confidence and I felt too old and too late for everything. 

Eventually I finished college and I haven’t been able to accomplish anything else eversince. 
I blamed it all on my laziness, I rationalised myself blaming my failures on my laziness and lack of trying. 
But since last year, I really made a conscious effort to try. I really did try so hard mentally to focus on the task at hand, made small goals to accomplish, made a routine for myself. But I noticed that I could never focus on anything for more than 20 mins at most. Even though I would make a mental note to not let anything distract myself, I would find myself hours later being distracted by the smallest of things and would feel like shit for having wasted all those time and it would repeat all over again. 
I tried to lock my phone up somewhere far away from my room thinking it was the source of my distraction but my mind would still find something else to waste my time on. It became a mental torture at this point. 
It seems like I would rather do literally anything else than the task at hand it doesn’t even have to be enjoyable at that point. 
It’s like my mind has another mind of its own and i lose control of it. 
This has caused me some major distress. 

Another thing i’ve noticed that, nothing feels natural and comfortable to me. 
For example, even when i’m doing a simple task of doing laundry, holding my clothes or the jar of detergent feels uncomfortable and unnatural to me, like i’m not holding it properly or something. Everything I do feels wrong and uncomfortable.

I was always straight and knew I was straight but I escalated to a picture of a feminine mans butt (I had a thing for girls butts back then).

I only pmo’d to this a few times before stopping.

I regret these actions so much and that’s the truth. I’ve no desire to ever do it again.

Can I still be straight despite doing these past actions? Or am I not straight because of these past actions?

,depression,"Hi all,
this is gonna be a long post so many thanks in advance for your precious help.
I’m struggling to cope with my boyfriend’s depression as I don’t really know what’s going on in his head, therefore I don’t know what’s the best thing to do to help him and us as a couple.
So - to give you a bit of background: we’ve been together since last November; when we met and started dating we realised we weren’t just physically attracted to each other - we had lots of things in common and saw life the same way. When ok, he really is an amazing partner, very caring and supportive. I felt (and still feel) very lucky to have him. He disclosed his depression struggles to me from the beginning; he suffered from it all his life (he’s 28 now) and that is due to his bad upbringing/bad life experiences, + a feeling of being powerless to change things which are wrong in society.
When I got to know him better, I started to see his depression episodes unfolding and I also learned to see when they start as he becomes very apathetic and tells me he feels “cold and empty”. I’ve been observing the pattern and the length of these episodes varies: they may go from a few days to more serious ones which last a few weeks. During these episodes he bottles up, doesn’t go to work and neglects himself - he just lays in bed with no strength for anything; needless to say, during these times he disappears from me too and sometimes without warning (we don’t live together). When he’s ok and back to normal, he always tells me not to worry as he adores me so I should never take his illness personally - he just needs a break from everything as he can’t deal with anything. He doesn’t want to take medications and never did; I fully support this decision as I 100% agree. He simply wants to find the core reason of the problem and deal with it himself. He recently started to see a psychologist once or twice a week, but I can’t really see any improvement: some days he feels very happy and hopeful but some others (the majority of them) he’s back to his struggles. Now I know that depression is a serious disease and it may take him years to get over it, but my questions are: will he ever be able to fully recover from it, or he will have to embrace the illness all his life? Is it possible for me to get used to it and for us to have a fulfilling relationship despite this?
I’m asking you because he doesn’t want to talk too much about it with me.
Also, I tend to worry a lot when he disappears without warning, as I can’t help but questioning his feelings for me or - even worse - I start getting paranoid that he may kill himself. He told me more than once that he never feels suicidal, just apathetic so not to worry. However, I can’t help but texting him and telling him I miss him and I hope he’s ok, but I don’t usually get a reply during these episodes so I really feel left out.
As a partner, what’s the best thing to do/way to deal with him disappearing? Should I not contact him at all knowing that he will come back to me when the episode subsides?
I look forward to getting some insight from other people who struggle (or did struggle) with depression.

,depression,"If I wrote everything that happened to me, people would say, “Wow, you’re a fighter” or “Try to find happiness.” The thing is, I kinda stopped having feelings when my mom passed away from an aneurysm. It happened out of nowhere. She was my best friend, and I was only 13 when it happened. I lost my person that day, and as months passed, I noticed my brother seemed sad but was and still is distant from my dad. My brother revealed to me that my dad was having an affair. He knew this before my mom passed away but decided not to tell her because he didn’t want to make her feel sad or lonely. I understood that, but my world fell apart when he told me about this. I knew why my dad didn’t always come back from work, why I felt the urge to go to my mom’s bedroom and just hug her until I fell asleep.

My brother and I confronted my dad, and he admitted it. He also told us he had a kid with this woman. That phrase took everything from me. I met this woman and even lived with her for a few years. She is the worst: so mean, yelling at me for no reason. I always cried because my dad knew this but never did anything about it. My brother started a new life; he got married and had a kid. My relationship with my brother is 1/10 because of this, so in a way, I lost my brother too. That woman and her son moved to another country, and now they live there. But a few weeks ago, I heard my dad calling them and using all these cute names for his son. It made me realize something: he was never like that with me. It made me feel like I’m not enough, like I’m not enough as a daughter to him. So I decided that maybe the best I can do is just live in peace with that. But still, I wish I had a father who didn’t decide to break his family.

I didn’t live with my father for a few months. I met a “nice guy,” but I regret it with all my heart. He was my first, and he got me pregnant. I got an abortion. To this day, I have flashbacks of everything: the way he treated me, when I told him he got me pregnant and gave me an STI. All of this made me realize that since I lost my mom, I was looking for love in the wrong places. Sometimes I feel like this world is not for me. Not once do I feel happy. When I wake up, I feel like I’m not real. I feel numb. What is the purpose of me if I’m just going to feel this hurt? I don’t trust anyone. I don’t say anything to my friends. They think I’m okay, but I’m so tired of pretending. Nobody knows that the nights for me are the worst because I remember everything and I cry until I fall asleep. I feel used, and I don’t wish that on anyone.

There are signs that I’m depressed: my hair is thin, and I had the most beautiful curly hair, but now it’s so thin. I don’t go out. I decided to study online this year, so I’m always in my room. I don’t talk to anyone, not even my family, if I ever had a family. Sometimes I think that there are other worlds out there, and maybe in one of them, I’m happy.

Before all this, I was such a happy girl. I don’t remember her anymore.",t2_972ioepfz,False,,0,False,I feel so tired ,[],r/depression,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e2zjau,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1720954619.0,text,,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I wrote everything that happened to me, people would say, “Wow, you’re a fighter” or “Try to find happiness.” The thing is, I kinda stopped having feelings when my mom passed away from an aneurysm. It happened out of nowhere. She was my best friend, and I was only 13 when it happened. I lost my person that day, and as months passed, I noticed my brother seemed sad but was and still is distant from my dad. My brother revealed to me that my dad was having an affair. He knew this before my mom passed away but decided not to tell her because he didn’t want to make her feel sad or lonely. I understood that, but my world fell apart when he told me about this. I knew why my dad didn’t always come back from work, why I felt the urge to go to my mom’s bedroom and just hug her until I fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My brother and I confronted my dad, and he admitted it. He also told us he had a kid with this woman. That phrase took everything from me. I met this woman and even lived with her for a few years. She is the worst: so mean, yelling at me for no reason. I always cried because my dad knew this but never did anything about it. My brother started a new life; he got married and had a kid. My relationship with my brother is 1/10 because of this, so in a way, I lost my brother too. That woman and her son moved to another country, and now they live there. But a few weeks ago, I heard my dad calling them and using all these cute names for his son. It made me realize something: he was never like that with me. It made me feel like I’m not enough, like I’m not enough as a daughter to him. So I decided that maybe the best I can do is just live in peace with that. But still, I wish I had a father who didn’t decide to break his family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn’t live with my father for a few months. I met a “nice guy,” but I regret it with all my heart. He was my first, and he got me pregnant. I got an abortion. To this day, I have flashbacks of everything: the way he treated me, when I told him he got me pregnant and gave me an STI. All of this made me realize that since I lost my mom, I was looking for love in the wrong places. Sometimes I feel like this world is not for me. Not once do I feel happy. When I wake up, I feel like I’m not real. I feel numb. What is the purpose of me if I’m just going to feel this hurt? I don’t trust anyone. I don’t say anything to my friends. They think I’m okay, but I’m so tired of pretending. Nobody knows that the nights for me are the worst because I remember everything and I cry until I fall asleep. I feel used, and I don’t wish that on anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are signs that I’m depressed: my hair is thin, and I had the most beautiful curly hair, but now it’s so thin. I don’t go out. I decided to study online this year, so I’m always in my room. I don’t talk to anyone, not even my family, if I ever had a family. Sometimes I think that there are other worlds out there, and maybe in one of them, I’m happy. I’m happy with my mom, and I got to learn how to wear makeup, how to dress nicely, how to recognize good boys from the bad ones. I know this is just a group of people telling their feelings, and maybe I’m overreacting, but please be a good person. I would like to know that good people exist, and I hope one day I stop having this feeling of regret, of not being enough, of feeling used, of feeling that someone touched me and hurt me, and deciding that maybe it’s better if I just end this once and for all.

,depression,"Can’t get over his past..

Having trouble letting go of my fiance’s past.

Hey there, so I met someone online in the year 2021, and we started dating. It was quite serious and was a commitment to get married eventually. The relationship was short lived since he had an all time low in his life by this time. He lost all his finances, his father met with An accident right in front of him home and slipped into a coma and he felt too much for himself and couldn’t deal with any of it , also because he is autistic I think. He ended up breaking up with me. The same day we broke up, he had a meeting in a different city and since he couldn’t afford a hotel room ended up staying at a colleagues place. They both were drunk , and she “got all over him” and they ended up having sex. Now be says he never wanted it, never planned it or such but it just happened and he regretted it deeply right after. And at this point he never thought we would ever speak again. But he could just not let me go for the next 5 months because he somehow thought he could make the money to come to me. But when he realized he couldn’t at this time and had too much for himself he decided to put a stop to it. Also, he started dating someone in these 5 months to make money off of her and entertained me at the same time. 

Fast forward to a year after , he comes back to my life and we end up meeting for the first time and falling in love all over again. Everything was great for over a year except for some fights here and there. But we were happy. Now we are in long distance for a few months until our marriage and I’m crippled by his past and what he has put me through. I just can’t seem to get over it. 

He is a great human being now, he’s changing so much and developed so much. He has redeemed himself and has come clean about a lot and makes sure I feel safe and secure no matter what. But, I can’t seem to let the past go. And idk what to do anymore. Idk if time will heal or it’ll never get better. Kindly let me know your take.

1- Due to a radical Proctectomy 27 years ago I was made impudent. About a yesr year later my wife left me for a man who is a 5 count felon and just got out of prison. She met him while we were doing a prison ministry. 
2- as a result of the surgery and radiation treatment for that cancer a permanent side effect was chronic diarrhea. 
3- I had a relationship with a lady that had MS. I pay all her bills. Cooked our food and did the household chores. I found out she was having an affair. So that ended in 2000 
4- 4 years ago I had a stroke. Although my family was very supportive I have five kids I chose to live in an assisted living facility. I also have to use a walker. I met a lady my age not realizing she was an avoidant. I went through love bombing till this relationship (?) ended.  Nice thing about assisted-living is almost everybody wears diapers. 
5- this year I lost bladder control. Between being totally incontinent and having to take usually 2 to 3 showers a day just to get clean and wet wipes don’t work with diarrhea.

The point of this is that I am totally incontinent, impudent, require a walker.

I feel that life in general is meaningless, and this world is full of hurt, and I don't understand how I can keep on living. I think about dying every single day, yet I'm not strong enough to go through with it. I don't want to hurt the people around me who do not view the world the same way I do, but I can't stop thinking about the relief of simply not excisting anymore.

I feel that I have so much hatred inside of me and so much anger, both towards myself and humanity itself. People are so cruel, both to other people, to animals, and to the planet. I think the world would be a much better place without humans. And I feel so alone with these thougths, and almost like they're ""illegal"", because humans are viewed as on top of the pyramide.

I see now that this post is just a mess, but I really just need to know if there is anyone out there sharing these thoughts, because I feel so alone. I wish there was a ""stop""-button to life, and that I could be able to end it when I wanted without all the dramatics. That there would be a painless way to go, without doing something that hurts. These thoughts have taken over my life, and even though I'm not ""struggling"", because I am able to function in the day-to-day life, I don't understand how much longer I can keep going with this chaos inside my head.

SO is there anyone out there who has been struggling with this and has found something that helped? A way to find meaning in life or just rewire the brain to be happy again? Or are there any motivational speakers/therapists that are known for struggling with this, but has found a way to erase those thoughts? I hope this reaches someone who can maybe share some advice.

,depression,"turned 15 recently.

  
since it hit summer break, everyone's response is always hanging out with friends or playing games all day. I do that as well, starting from June 12th till now(it was fun) but I hate being pulled back to reality and all the things I need to face sooner after I graduate or go to college. I suffered from symptoms of autism, TICS, adhd and had vivid daydreaming as a coping method which keeps me happy and grateful the whole time and stuff like that. Mother always told me that I'm going to end up nowhere happy as her because I played videogames almost every day(I did study as well, but I hate when she yelled at me, told me to revise and told me how addicted I am. I just want to enjoy my three months worth of holidays well after stressful studies of IGCSE and exams.

maybe I couldn't live without my devices, but I just don't want to be reminded of studying for the first couple of months as I need relaxation time.

and I hate when she tells me that I'd end up begging on the streets because I hated reading actual books(I preferred fanfiction, but she despises when I use the internet to read). I don't like when she encourages me even though I already am reading other things, I absolutely despised on how I'd be brought out of my colorful world where I find escapism. Most of all, since I'm in a British school curriculum, I'd be hitting year 11 after august passes. I overthink a lot and I wonder where I'd end up in college/the future, and that thought scares me and brings me desolation since my mother tells me a lot about my life's failure if I continue my 'addiction' right now, but I simply wish to be left alone so I could turn everything all around and such. 

  
everything's just so blurry for me. I've had people give up on me because I hated studying during a period of time, and my past trauma has managed to glue myself to a screen so I could seek hope from my online friends and games or so. It's like taking drugs, but in a safer way. When the adults ask me which college I'd go, I'd be stressed due to my uncertainity and no one likes that feeling too. 

in conclusion, I wished I could've been the better child our family looks upon. Absolutely despised my mother for being mentally abusive, sometimes physically and how she let the whole family down by being jobless and not having a uni degree right now.

,depression,"Hi. I'm struggling at the moment. Let me tell you my story

Up until last summer I was happy. I had never felt lonely or depressed. Since then I moved to another country with my ex. We broke up after about 5 months after moving. I was heart broken then but out of nowhere over very shortly after the breakup. I met another woman and it made me happy again and I was completely honest with her. She knew my situation completely and while I was not able to do everything I wanted due to financial issues of moving to another country while still paying a mortgage back home.  I also have chronic sciatica that is stopping me from being able to enjoy even the most basic of things. I do have surgery coming up to fix the herniated disk so hopefully that will be sorted soon. 

I have gone on a bit of a ramble. Tldr. I am so fucking lonely and I am struggling to make friends. I don't know why it's so hard to make friends since turning 30. I just need some ideas to try make friends that doesnt involve running into another relationship as I don't think I have it in me to be heartbroken again with no friends to speak to. I've been thinking about killing myself daily with almost every other thought. Now I am not going to as honestly the only reason I could think of is that I wouldn't want to upset my family.

I&amp;#39;m struggling at the moment. Let me tell you my story&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up until last summer I was happy. I had never felt lonely or depressed. Since then I moved to another country with my ex. We broke up after about 5 months after moving. I was heart broken then but out of nowhere over very shortly after the breakup. I met another woman and it made me happy again and I was completely honest with her. She knew my situation completely and while I was not able to do everything I wanted due to financial issues of moving to another country while still paying a mortgage back home.  I also have chronic sciatica that is stopping me from being able to enjoy even the most basic of things. I do have surgery coming up to fix the herniated disk so hopefully that will be sorted soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have gone on a bit of a ramble. Tldr. I am so fucking lonely and I am struggling to make friends. I don&amp;#39;t know why it&amp;#39;s so hard to make friends since turning 30. I just need some ideas to try make friends that doesnt involve running into another relationship as I don&amp;#39;t think I have it in me to be heartbroken again with no friends to speak to. I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about killing myself daily with almost every other thought. Now I am not going to as honestly the only reason I could think of is that I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to upset my family. I have spoken to my family about how I&amp;#39;m feeling but I don&amp;#39;t know. They tell me to go out and do stuff. But it&amp;#39;s not stopping the dark thoughts I am having.

I never left that mindset till I met my ex, she showed me that all that was true, but after almost 2 decades of dealing with people who I thought loved and cared about me, just to have them turn once I wasn't useful, it was difficult to believe that for the first time in my life someone loved me unconditionally.

Im 21 years old and i have Crohn's disease. If you don't know what it is, it's causing inflammation in the gut.

Well also i been doin the same exam for 5 years repeatedly. All my friends are in college now but I am doing ALevels for the 3rd time. It's my third and last time doing this exam. I know i can get into a good university but i just cant study. Im trying to do my best but i cant.  My mind doesn't allow me to.  

My tummy hurts because of crohns now. And i know theres a connection between gut and mental health. 

My situation now
:i wanna leave this house
:i dont have friends 
:i dont talk to anyone.  Im home all day. Trying to study. But i dont study
:i feel like a falier

,depression,"***TRIGGER WARNING SUICIDAL IDEATIONS***

Why do I wake up every single morning with suicidal ideations? They used to last me almost most of the day and not go away no matter what I tried to do. Now it only seems to be when I wake up and then it seems to digress through the day, it just seems to disappear and then I don't usually have issues anymore for the rest of the day. Some days though, it still would come and stay throughout the day and or go away and then come back later as well.

Then with my sleeping, even if I sleep 7 or 8 hours, I still wake up tired. Most of the time I wake up extremely tired and fatigued like I haven't slept.

I've also tried going to the hospital several times and there's been issues when I've went there (if you would like to know what happened feel free to ask and I'll tell you). I also went inpatient at the mental ward part of the hospital back in February of this year, but I ended up not getting any help in some issues occurred while I was there (if you would like to know what happened, feel free to ask and I'll tell you).

,depression,"""Are you okay?"" 
Yeah I'm fine.
My brain screaming ""NO I'M NOT OKAY!!!""
I'm the only one that hears it. 
I haven't been okay in 20 years. I distract myself with people that I deem need me and push hard on that. I attach myself to people that are not okay thinking I will be the one that can help them find the place to be okay. A broken man trying to fix broken things hoping it fixes him.
I'm angry all the time and I push it down so nobody will feel it. I plaster a fake smile on and laugh and joke all the while dieing inside and no one sees. Silence is deafening and the only thing that truly scares me is being alone. I starve for attention while I tell people that I'm an introvert. 
I don't ask for help because I feel I can't more over I feel there will be none. I've have honed the craft of mimicking people in situations to fit in to blend and hide amongst the crowd. For acceptance. When I'm comfortable with a person the see the real me but it could take years for that. I don't trust easily and when I do I give my full heart to that person romantic or not. They have seen me and accept me. But every one leave in time. On thier own accord or death. I am left alone and it hurts and it scares me. I leave situations I can no longer deal with. Because it's easier than putting on a smile taking the assault and feel worse than I did before but if they feel better than that's all that matters. It's not them it's me. 
""You are so smart""
""You are so talented""
""You know so much about everything."" 
""You could be doing so much more.""
""You are so calm all the time""
""Nothing phases you.""
I learn things so I have the answer when someone needs it. I put that to practical use so I can help when someone needs it. If I thought I was good enough I might be able to focus long enough to do more. I have to stay calm or I will explode. 
I get stuck in routine because it is the only sense of normalcy I get in my life. It's the only thing that makes me be able to deal. When the routine is disrupted by outside forces (IE not me disrupting it) I don't deal very well. I develop new routines that become the new standard when it is disrupted in a major way. I'm straight forward and expect people to be the same but my mimicking skills gives me a way to be straight forward without upsetting the other person. Most of the time. My brain works differently I'm not ""Normal"" people expect something that I can never give them no matter how hard I try. I do try. People don't know how to talk to me. Or deal with me. They think they can for awhile but realize that they can't and I'm left alone again. At one point I tried to find the solace in the loneliness and I did for awhile. But it doesn't last never does. I attach myself to people and give my heart because I need that connection. And I so badly want to connect. Nothing is as beautiful in this world than looking into someone's eyes and seeing them and being seen by them. That connection can't break not for me. You showed me something that very few have seen. That is the true beauty in this life a connection with another person on the planet. Another person that has wants and desires and hopes and dreams. When someone leaves the beauty leaves with them. But connection is always there. Because when you find them again they feel it to. Even though I seem disconnected in a moment with a person I'm not. I'm there in the room but my mind is in a thousand places also. What you are saying is connecting with those things also and deeming the meaning of all of it. In the middle of a conversation I might say baby elephants are adorable even though we weren't talking about animals at all.

,depression,"This post may sound very dramatic, but it is my true relationship with my condition.

In my early teenage years I had a very bad period and I got depressed. The reason is that during that period I first really realized that albinism would severely limit my life, and since then I've started to experience suicidal thoughts.

I really feel like I'm not understood by anyone when I talk about my disease. I have a severe form of oculus albinism which gives me a 20/100 vision, and a slight form of oculucutanous albinism. I can't even stand at home with windows opened without the sunlight hurting my eyes, and apparently no one seems to take this seriously. I've just stopped talking about this when it happens and just go somewhere else. I also have a lot of difficulties doing simple tasks like using a computer, using a smartphone, reading a book, watching tv and, of course, driving. 

I think I will eventually end my life for this. It's something I have thought a lot about in the past, and sometimes I've got really close to doing that. I started to get psychological visits, but that didn't really help. I know that I have to accept it and that there are a lot of the worst genetic diseases out there, but in the real life it seems like everyone has a normal life, and that hurts. It hurts a lot. I can't accept the fact that I will never see the world as it truly is, or that I will never be able to see the sky without sunglasses, and without my eyes that still hurt while I'm wearing them. 

You can tell me the things that everyone keeps telling me from years, such as that I have to accept it, that I can still have a healthy life etc. I'm just not normal, and what I'm seeing isn't normal.

,depression,"I can hardly make sense of my life. The majority of it has felt like two incohesive blurs. The first blur was my late middle school to high school years. I was sick; bedridden for the first year or two, then too ill to really be part of the world until I started to recover when I was 17. I tried to attend high school, but only managed a couple months in person each year before needing to drop out because I was too sick to keep attending. I was in and out of hospitals, so outside of the... what, maybe 8 or so total months of high school? Probably less. Outside of that, everything was the same. Sit on my ass all day, watch YouTube, watch porn that may or may not have been really fucked up, play video games, and occasionally go to the hospital for testing. At a certain point I started to forget what year it was. By the time I was 17, I had to check a calendar just to remember my age. Then the second blur. Sure, I've gotten better, and so has life to an extent, but everything felt like a blur. It still feels like a blur. Maybe because of how quickly everything happened? I started a recovery routine, then 2020 happened, then there were family issues, then I held a shit job, left that shit job, attended college for a little under a year, spent months trying to enlist, failed, then have been looking for work ever since to no avail. At least I can remember the date and my age now. Work and college also really helped me learn to be human again. Still, I pretty much just kept to myself when I was working and in college. People were nice to me in school, but I never formed any real connections. I never hung out with anyone, only occasionally BS'd with a few guys during school hours, then lost contact with everyone after a graduation I didn't attend. It doesn't feel like I finally started to truly live, just that I got used to being around people again. I still can't socialize for shit. It's hard even with relatives. It's weird interacting with people my age, and especially with teenagers. When I was trying to enlist, I temporarily trained with a group of people who were all younger than me. It doesn't help that I'm short and baby-faced. It's a really weird feeling when people younger than you call you ""kid,"" or when a high school student treats you like the archetypical shy underclassman you see in movies. People have't been rude, but it's jarring to interact with high school students only to realize that they've had WAY more life experience than me. It feels like a reminder that roughly a decade has just flown past me. Nearly half my life has just flown past me.

I don't think I've had a bad life. I think I've just an incredibly uneventful one. I was talking to someone I know about it. They said that, even if I don't think so, I'm actually traumatized from illness and isolation. Is that really trauma though?

,depression,"My family is not my comfort zone. It never was. The older I get, the more weight I can feel on my shoulders. My mom has really high expectations of me. Since I was young I would always fight with my mom over everything, even the smallest thing like making a noise while eating. She‘s like a perfectionist and wants me to be like her too. I know she’s always telling me that it’s for my own sake but it’s too much for me to handle. I wasn’t good at school when I was young, so when my grades came out I always got scolded by her. She said things like, „Is it that hard to be good at school?“ „Why can’t you do something that easy?“ Can’t you be someone I can be proud of at least once?“ She does triggered some traumatic feelings of me. Because of what I went through I grew up with low self esteem and the feeling of being afraid of making mistakes. When we moved to another country I did my best with everything. I got better at school and even graduated from a prestigious university with a good degree. I thought maybe now my mom will be proud of me, but her reaction wasn’t like what I expected. She never praised me for my achievements and started to criticize me in other ways. She cares A LOT about what other people think about her. So I had to be the perfect daughter she can brag about. The problem was…I was never good enough for her. I don’t fit the beauty standard and I already know it but getting this told by my own mom always makes me feel hurt. She REALLY CARES A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE’S OPINIONS. I always get comments like “Why are you so fat?” “Did you gained weight again?” “I told you not to eat.” “You’ll never be beautiful if you continue to look this way” It’s not only my weight she cares about but also my face. She even had me do a nose job and a lip surgery to look better. I always have to wear Makeup and dress well when I go out. And she’ll always comment on my outfits like “why are you wearing wide jeans? It makes you look fat“ and even said things like „What are you doing? What will other people think of me because of your actions? They‘ll think I didn’t raised you right.“ I‘m so sick of those comments, there were a few times I wanted to end my life. I can’t be that perfect daughter she expects me to be. And because of that I‘m more fond of my friends than my family. But at the end I got betrayed a few times. Being kind and genuine to others doesn’t mean they’ll be kind and genuine to you. I never learned from the same mistakes until recently. Reality hit me hard.

I feel like I do it to just escape reality in short term. But after coming back to reality, nothing changed. It was a temporary happiness. I know that therapy might help me but to be honest I don’t want the be treated. It’s not exactly like I don’t want to be healed but I want to leave more. I lost my reason to live.

,depression,"Life is an utter mess. Got nothing going for me; not even a job, or a friend. Crawling out of this hole feels like the toughest task I've ever faced. I don't think if I even know how to.

I'm quite tired. I can literally feel the absolute mental exhaustion seeping into my body. Imagine those spells in video games that sap your stamina or your life force. It's like I've been living under the influence of something like that for years. Only my tank is empty now.

When I speak to someone, I can sense myself dissociating. I watch myself say dumb or insensitive things and ruin a potential friendship. I try to distract myself with my old hobbies; I feel absolutely nothing. I try to create goals and change my circumstances, but I quickly breakdown when I remember I have nothing to look forward to.

I'm almost sure that death should solve all these problems for me. I used to say death didn't scare me. But dying does. It's a wholely unfamiliar experience, and I've never had a particularly adventurous spirit.

,depression,"I guess I wanted to make this post because I want to gain some advice or reassurance in my understanding of why I have experienced mental health issues relating to anxiety and depression for the past 7 years (since I was 18, now 25). I want to share a background of my experience with these issues and hopefully gain some insight to how I should move forward, because it has been a constant struggle. Like everyone's mental health experience, it is unique to them and it is extremely complicated, stemming from an array of different things such as childhood trauma, nutrient deficiency,, microbiome health, etc. 

Background:

Finishing highschool was definitely the trigger to my first anxiety episode. Navigating what I wanted to do with my life was stressful and I felt as if for the first time in my life, I did not have a clear path. At the time, I didn't even know it was anxiety, but during the year after highschool it was like a flip switched inside of me and hasn't been the same since. Not to say there werent times where I was anxious in childhood, because there definitely was, but this was the first time I really felt the physical and mental effects of suffering from anxiety. This was presented in OCD like behavior with repetitive thought patterns, overthinking, physical tension in chest and stomach (like an urge to cry), insomnia and other symptoms of anxiety. I ended up going straight into full time work and struggled these things regularly but would go days or weeks of not feeling symptoms. It was always irregular and I never knew why I was feeling these things. I have always been healthy and conscious of my diet, sleep, exercise and was never abusing drugs or alcohol so it was a bit of a shock when these symptoms “randomly” occurred. I was determined to find an underlying biological or physical reason for these feelings and have and still do try supplements, more exercise, eliminating certain foods, regular sleep etc which all help to an extent but have never actually resolved any issues.

These issues persisted and it was shitty but I was able to manage myself and it never really spiraled until I had a bad insomnia episode a couple of years later. This was a combination of the anxiety I had in general which ended up causing anxiety around going to sleep and they just fed off each other. After really struggling for a couple of months I decided to try medication and was given lexapro. Once the lexapro started working, for the first time in ages I felt a sense of normalcy. I was stable, my random anxious thoughts and feelings in my body were gone, I genuinely felt like the best version of myself. My sleep was good again and I stayed on lexapro for about 9 months before deciding I wanted to come off, thinking I had healed my brain of whatever weird neurological misfirings that caused these problems. I hadnt been to therapy at all at this point but I was so determined that I had cured these problems and didn't want to stay on a medication for whatever reason - I think I was ashamed of being on medication and was also scared of staying on them long term. 

For almost a year after I stayed off medication and continued to try to heal myself naturally. I had improved with understanding these feelings, I had a better grasp of the causes or what my anxious brain thinks that's wrong with my external environment. I finished my degree and was working full time doing something unrelated to my studies and had decided to move cities and also had just been accepted to a serious full time job. The stresses of these triggered an insomnia episode again and I said fuck it, ill go back on the medication. However, this time the lexapro didn't work and for some reason made me feel depressed. I hadn't really understood what depression was like but now with what I know, its closely related to anxiety. Anyway, I moved cities and although my life improved because I made new friends, was enjoying living out of home, moved to a place I really like, felt less lonely I still had these shitty feelings. I came of the lexapro after trying it for 2 months and decided to get prescribed a different medication. I was determined for this one to work and was put on zoloft. The zoloft killed my anxiety but made me even more depressed. My moods were very up and down. Zoloft didnt work for me either and I decided I really needed to go to therapy instead of using a medication (I know, I should of gone to therapy long before any of this but it was hard as I didnt communicate properly to my parents or friends and wanted to solve the issues on my own.

I went for 10 therapy sessions and learnt a lot of information about myself that I didn't know. I believe the stuff I learnt gave me a clearer perspective of the disorder in a way I hadn't seen it. That is, that it has deep roots in my subconscious brain that stemmed from things that happened in childhood. This was helpful for sure and improved some aspects of it but I was still struggling everyday with these feelings. I weaned myself off the zoloft and stayed off it for a couple of months before ending up going back to the doctor in distress asking for a new medication. I tried Lexapro again for 2 months and it didn't work. I was also going through a lot of stress from a breakup, at this time so I think this may have impacted the efficacy of my third time trying lexapro. The lexapro was making me feel shit so I tried prozac. Again, for two months I stayed on prozac and hated it. This one by far made me feel the worst. I felt like a zombie. That was about 4 months ago. Situationally everything has improved and I am a lot happier with things objectively speaking. They are the best they've ever been but I'm still a mess and have this depression/anxiety that will present itself all the time. I am booked into therapy again which I am excited for. But I don't know what to do. I feel like I have tried everything. 

I have read a lot about psilocybin therapy and have used psilocybin many times recreationally but I want to explore a high dose trip alone, and hopefully find some sort of cure to this disease. I understand it's not going to be a quick fix thing but I am losing hope and desperately want to do something to heal myself. I think starting therapy again and doing a big trip will be beneficial. Its fucking annoying that everything in my life is great, yet I will randomly and sporadically get these thoughts and feelings. At the moment it's a lot of depression. I hate how it makes me spiral.

I want to share a background of my experience with these issues and hopefully gain some insight to how I should move forward, because it has been a constant struggle. Like everyone&amp;#39;s mental health experience, it is unique to them and it is extremely complicated, stemming from an array of different things such as childhood trauma, nutrient deficiency,, microbiome health, etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Background:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finishing highschool was definitely the trigger to my first anxiety episode. Navigating what I wanted to do with my life was stressful and I felt as if for the first time in my life, I did not have a clear path. At the time, I didn&amp;#39;t even know it was anxiety, but during the year after highschool it was like a flip switched inside of me and hasn&amp;#39;t been the same since. Not to say there werent times where I was anxious in childhood, because there definitely was, but this was the first time I really felt the physical and mental effects of suffering from anxiety. This was presented in OCD like behavior with repetitive thought patterns, overthinking, physical tension in chest and stomach (like an urge to cry), insomnia and other symptoms of anxiety. I ended up going straight into full time work and struggled these things regularly but would go days or weeks of not feeling symptoms. It was always irregular and I never knew why I was feeling these things. I have always been healthy and conscious of my diet, sleep, exercise and was never abusing drugs or alcohol so it was a bit of a shock when these symptoms “randomly” occurred.

,depression,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for my whole life. I have gotten significantly better, I am able to manage the illness better and it does not affect me in serious ways. I have support from loved ones and a safety plan in case things were to be bad again, but it has not been the case in several years. 



However, there are times I feel myself slipping into a depressive episode and fall back into my bad habits. Recently, I felt myself slipping into a episode, and I mustered the bit of energy I had to let my loved ones know that I needed some space and time alone. I chose to self isolate. The reason was because I needed time to process the emotions and felt like a burden to my loved ones. During this time, I was not able to think rationally and I was very critical of myself and I felt unworthy, ashamed and exhausted. The urge to self isolate hasn't happened in a long time, but I gave into that urge due to the strong emotions. When I felt a bit better after a few days, I reached out again. 



My loved one told me that he did not like this behaviour, and that if I were to self sabotage again he cannot choose to care about me anymore. 

He told me, a mistake only happens once and choosing to isolate, whether it is inconsistent or not, is a choice. If I get the urge to isolate and I act upon it, and there are times I don’t want help from my loved ones, then he just can’t continue to care for me. 

He said I am free to do as I please, withdraw from people, isolate myself. I just cannot expect him to care if I do. 

He said if I cannot allow someone who cares about me to help shoulder the burden of my pain and suffering, then his mental energy is better spent elsewhere.

What he said is completely valid. However, I think of this situation differently.



I think that life is very unpredictable and people will experience a lot of grief and a lot of pain that can make you lose sight of yourself. It can be extremely difficult to reach out for support when the illness is convincing you that you're unworthy. I don't know what will happen in the future, I know that I will probably make the same mistakes again and choose to self isolate. But I also know that during this time, I need my loved ones there for me no matter what. I need people to be there for me when I feel unworthy of love, ESPECIALLY when I feel unworthy of love. The more warmth I am shown, the more strength I will have to get out of the muck. It's a battle with the illness. It's not that I don't want support, it's that I believe I am unworthy of support. I constantly try to fight the negative thoughts that occur when I feel this way, somedays, it's too much for me and I give in and believe them. 



Now, I am very upset. I am sad because someone who I love very much and loves me very much said that to me. I have to accept that I will probably make the same mistake again, because I'm on the road to recovery, and I have to accept that if I do, he won't be there for me.

,depression,"I’ve really fucked up everything around me. My mental health has plummeted and I can’t get out of my own head. I’ve been pacing in silence for 5 hours. I’ve tried to lay down but my heart won’t stop racing. I live in the middle of nowhere, have really shitty job that only schedules me for 4 hour shifts and pays 12 an hour and my schedule is never consistent or a full week. My car’s rear seal is busted and it won’t hold oil any more. The last time I put some oil in there was so much smoke everywhere. So I’ve been relying on people within our community to get me to and from work, over a month late on rent. Lawn is overgrown got no mower, landscaper hasn’t shown up despite putting me on the schedule 3 weeks ago. New meds are killing me, I wish I can find the list of all the meds I’ve been on through out the last 9 years. And the worst part is I’ve turned to alcohol to numb it all. I just can’t make anything work and follow through. I keep making the worst decisions. I know this all sounds like complaining, but to make matters much much worse is seeing all of you struggling with life too. Everyone’s got their own story or nightmares going on and it hurts my heart to see you all in pain. I’m so sorry everyone’s experiencing what they are. This world is relentless and depression is the worst thing that could have ever happened to all of us. Oh and our electric is so past due we’re getting shut off on the 17th. And my wife works from home so yeah. She struggles too and when you got two people struggling with anxiety and depression, you can’t talk to each other when you need support from the one person in your life.

My mental health has plummeted and I can’t get out of my own head. I’ve been pacing in silence for 5 hours. I’ve tried to lay down but my heart won’t stop racing. I live in the middle of nowhere, have really shitty job that only schedules me for 4 hour shifts and pays 12 an hour and my schedule is never consistent or a full week. My car’s rear seal is busted and it won’t hold oil any more. The last time I put some oil in there was so much smoke everywhere. So I’ve been relying on people within our community to get me to and from work, over a month late on rent. Lawn is overgrown got no mower, landscaper hasn’t shown up despite putting me on the schedule 3 weeks ago. New meds are killing me, I wish I can find the list of all the meds I’ve been on through out the last 9 years. And the worst part is I’ve turned to alcohol to numb it all. I just can’t make anything work and follow through. I keep making the worst decisions. I know this all sounds like complaining, but to make matters much much worse is seeing all of you struggling with life too. Everyone’s got their own story or nightmares going on and it hurts my heart to see you all in pain. I’m so sorry everyone’s experiencing what they are. This world is relentless and depression is the worst thing that could have ever happened to all of us. Oh and our electric is so past due we’re getting shut off on the 17th. And my wife works from home so yeah. She struggles too and when you got two people struggling with anxiety and depression, you can’t talk to each other when you need support from the one person in your life.

,depression,"Idk if this is the right place to share this, but I think it might be the only place. 

This happened around 20+ years ago now,  back when I was in my first or second year of high school. I was getting bullied every single day, had no friends, nobody to talk to about it, and was an absolute ball of emotions.    
Most of the time I was just pure rage, because how the hell could the teachers turn a blind eye, when the bullies weren't even being subtle? So many kids bullied me, that the teachers just made the mathematical decision that it was better to ignore one child, than punish 5+, and ruin their education. 

So one day, I was at my lowest, and decided to end it all. The issue was, I hated the pain of being cut, drowning wouldn't work because I kept coming up for air, and I couldn't tie any knots. 

So I decided to use my own school tie.... This is when it gets funny.

I had one of those closets that's built into the wall, with a shelf and a bar for hanging clothes hangers...so my absolute dumbo brain, decided to put my tie through the bar, hold onto the other end of the tie with both hands.... And lift my legs off the ground.... Like a god damn looney tunes character. 

I only dangled for a few seconds, before I lost my grip and came crashing down with an almighty thud. 

It was at that point, that I realised how unbelievably dumb what I tried to do was. Not because I wanted to live, or because it didn't make sense to punish myself for other people's actions. Only because the way I tried, was so cartoon levels of dumb. So I'm just lay on the ground, my school tie messed up laughing my ass off. 


Sadly when I went downstairs, and tried to casually tell my mom that I had just tried to hang myself, the timing could not of been worse. She was right in the middle of watching a talk show about depressed kids who had tried to kill themselves. So when I told her what I had just done she yelled at me for making it up, saying that the kids on TV had genuine problems, and I was grounded and sent back to my room. 


It wasn't till over a decade later that I told her what I had tried to do, and reminded her of how she had yelled at me. Honestly I think even a decade later from telling her, she still hasn't forgiven herself.

But for me, it's weirdly one of my funniest memories. The time I tried to off myself like a god damn looney tunes character. Like I was gonna pass out, yet somehow keep holding the tie. 

I still have depression, though it's hard to tell some days, due to all the genuinely legitimate reasons we all have to be sad, and not want to get out of bed in the morning (like if my life was great and I felt this way, then it would be obvious it's depression, but even people without depression would agree that life sucks right now) but I never tried to kill myself ever again, thanks to how dumb I felt when I did try.

,depression,"I (23f) am in a major depressive episode due to a shitty life situation and also because I’ve had depression on and off since I was 10. My usual SSRI (Paxil), which I’ve taken for nearly 10 years isn’t helping at all anymore. I’ve tried Wellbutrin, which I hated because it made me tired for some reason and I didn’t feel comfortable taking something that could cause weight loss (literally was 93 pounds at the time he prescribed it so no idea why he thought that was a good idea). Mirtazapine, which is way too sedating even at a high dose (we’re talking sleeping 17 hours). Mirtazapine didn’t have any positive effects on my mood and honestly made me feel worse. But it got me to a normal weight so I at least feel better about my body.

My depression puts me in a perpetual state of exhaustion, but it makes it hard to fall asleep at night. Once I’m asleep, I easily sleep 8+ hours and it’s hard to get up. Apparently my psychiatrist only heard “can’t fall asleep” and prescribed Lunesta. I cancelled the prescription immediately once I found out what it was. He didn’t explain any of the dangers or that it was a controlled substance.

I am literally incapable of feeling positive emotions right now. I’m incapable of feeling joy, and doing things I like. I can’t feel happiness or love. Everything makes me sad and I feel numb. All I feel is darkness and I’m tired of feeling like this.

,depression,"My partner has been on vacation for two weeks and recently returned. When he was gone, I had a depressive episode (honestly, not my worst one, but still), and long story short, it led to us almost breaking up over the phone. His main reasoning was that he already ""deals"" with it with his mom, has had bad experiences in the past, and is going off that. Essentially just saying that having a depressive partner would be too ""difficult/hard"" for him to deal with, even though he hasn't made a huge attempt to cater to me personally. This is the first time he's seen me like this.

A lot happened in between, but I ended up basically saying that we aren't breaking up until we (he) try. But now, especially after summarizing it, Im wondering if I should've just let him leave. I'm wondering if, at the next difficult roadblock, he's just going to be like, ""This is too hard; I'm out."" I don't feel as secure as I used to, as sure of his love for me, and I'm worried about things progressing because I don't want to be a year in, having poured so much into the relationship, and he leaves because things get hard. 

Some context: His mother also has depression and is a lot more volatile with it than I am. Same with past girlfriends. About 3-4 days ago, she asked him to help kill herself. His trip has also been overstimulating (his words) and not as pleasant as he wanted. Yes, I'm in the process of getting help; I need money to pay for therapy and to see a psychiatrist, but that's my number one priority. I don't expect him to sacrifice everything to try and fix me, but as my partner, I do expect him to be there for me and ride out the storm with me. It's only been about 4 months, so I didn't expect him to know all my ins and outs, but I did expect him to stay and try, and if I hadn't stepped in, I feel he wouldn't have. 

I also want to note that he has been an absolutely amazing boyfriend prior to this (opens every door for me, pays for almost everything, always compliments me, good morning texts, the list goes on) so this really through me. It feels like we should just call it quits but I'm wondering if there's any possible alternative.

,depression,"Everyone just leaves in the end without fail. No one has ever really liked me, my best friend of over 10 years stopped talking to me for no reason, I tried to arrange a day out with another “friend” recently and they just left me on delivered for days so it never happened. I’ve had friends before but I was always the last choice, the one who was walking behind everyone, the one no one really cares if they’re there or not. No one comes by to visit, no one calls, no one asks me how I’m doing, no one cares. There’s something about me people just don’t like, something so deeply imbedded into me. It has to be a me problem because it’s such a strong trend in my life. 

I don’t enjoy anything anymore, nothing feels good, video games are boring to me now. I don’t have any hobbies, I don’t have anyone to go out with, I just sit in my room and bed rot. 
Nothing is enjoyable. I either feel empty or my emotions smother me. I mainly just feel angry or sad and it’s just too much, I feel too weak to experience my emotions. There is nothing for me in this life, everyday that goes by I just get increasingly more frustrated at life, more nihilistic, more misanthropic. I don’t want to be like this but I can’t escape my mind. 

I’m so so jealous of those who have relatively “normal” lives. Friends, not poor, good mental health. Why not me? I wish I had just ended it all those years ago, I really fucking wish I did.

,depression,"20M, been lonely for most of my life, just rewatched those old funny youtube videos cause feeling lonely, still laughed but it wasn't the same anymore.

I disgusted the idea that I'm having fun, I cursed at myself for being happy. I realized, the child inside me is dead after all those years of chasing after people, seeking their attention and approval.

I don't even know who am I anymore.

I've been lonely pretty much my whole life, I always tries to start and initiate conversation, I always helps people without asking anything in return cause I just wants to be their friend.

But why am I always the last choice? They only talk to me when they need something, they only ask me out because all their friends are busy, when I talk my words mean nothing and ignored or cut mid sentence,  
if I don't text them first, they will probably forget that I ever exist.

I really wanted to die but reading other thread about how my death gonna hurt my family, I don't want that.

I feel stuck. At this point, I just want to focus all the time I have left on this earth into my career and money, cause atleast I will still have some purpose to continue.

It's so tiring trying to keep going. I can't understand anything in life anymore.
