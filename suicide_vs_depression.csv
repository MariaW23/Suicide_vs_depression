"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,177,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/
"Regular check-in post, with information about our rules and wikis","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are permitted here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

-----

Our subreddit rules are located in the sidebar (you can also always access them at https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/about/rules) - since all of them exist for important safety reasons, we ask everyone here to read and follow them. Please click 'report' on any harmful content you see here - we always want to know and deal as soon as we can.

We also have several wikis there for help with finding and giving support:

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/what_is_depression provides guidance about what is and isn't a depressive disorder, guidance on the complex nature of the illnesses that are usually grouped under the ""depression"" label, and redirect information for common off-topic issues.

https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/giving_help offers information on the nature and value of peer support for mental-health issues in general, and lots of guidance for learning what is -- and isn't -- usually helpful in giving peer support.

YSK that the types of rule violations that we most frequently see interfering with people getting safe and relevant support here are:

- People breaking the private contact rule. You should never trust anyone who tries to get you into a private conversation in response to a post here. See https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/wiki/private_contact

- ""I'm here to help"" posts. This shows that you don't understand the most basic principles of peer support, especially selectivity. The ""giving help"" wiki explains more about this.

- Role modelling, i.e. ""achievement"" or ""advice"" posts. This is an expert-free zone -- that's what peer support means (rule 5). We know that ""internet culture"" celebrate not just bragging about your achievements but bragging about your good intentions. Nothing like that is ever acceptable here.

- Content that's more about 'making a statement' or casually polling the sub than seeking personal support (or, in a comment, giving it) (rules 1, 2 and 10).

- Off-topic posts about difficult situations or circumstances, including interpersonal losses. Grief, sadness, anger, and other difficult emotions are not mental illnesses. The ""what is depression"" wiki has suggestions for other places to post about these issues, which are 100% valid and serious but inappropriate here.",SQLwitch,156,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1bq9t74/regular_checkin_post_with_information_about_our/

I am so tired of these waves...,"To be honest, I don't even care if people are gonna read this or not, I just need to get it out.

I feel cursed. I don't know how to explain but this is how I've been feeling for now 3 years.

I feel so depressed, helpless and misunderstood that I just lost hope this feeling will leave me for ever...

I've been depressed for 1 year as a 10 y.o because of bullying and other stuff. It was so bad that at a point I had suicidal thoughts on daily basis.
I escaped this horrible soul crushing feeling somehow... or so I thought.

On the last year of middle school the same feeling comes back but this time the situation was way different.

I had A LOT of people around me but only a few actual friends. Even though I was loved from a lot of people, I felt so so lonely...
To the point that it was getting hard to fake being happy.

The reason of that?? I DON'T KNOW!!!
I mean, I lived some tough things but I went through worse.
I tried to find the reason why but was unsuccessful and I still am...

These waves last for sometimes weeks but longest was 7 months (last year).

Last year I had a whole week where it felt like I was in a constant nightmare. I felt lost, extremely tired and kinda scared for some reason.

It's been 3 years since it came back and it's killing me inside. I feel like a hole in my chest and I can't fill it.

I wanna fill it with love but even that is too much to ask for, I somehow will end up ruining it like a lot of things.

I feel like I will never experienced real love, unconditional love, mutual love. Someone always ends up getting hurt.

I feel so lonely to the point it hurts physically, 
I hate that my mother sees me being sad, I can't even express all of this to her as it will result to nothing.

I'm tired of faking, tired of failing, tired of this unbearable pain.

What the fuck is up with this world,"I'm so over this world. why would we continue living in this dogshit world. 

Everything in this world is a fucking joke and its affecting me in the worst way possible. I have descended into this state of being cold... I've become a cold hearted, emotionless husk that can only operate at work. Once I'm at home all i do is sit, game, eat or fantasize about a better life that is so out of reach. The feeling of daily paralysis and not being happy or content even existing is tiring. Sleep is too hard these days too. iv been awake for days just thinking. Not being able to feel emotion and feeling like there's nothing to do anymore in life but to work is just shit. Its cost me friends and is about to cost me my marriage.

Outside my 4 walls that i call home, i am continuously met with a society that cannot seem to accept one another. My very religious family is always out there to condemn every choice i ever make or have made in the past. Society is always trying to convert other people to their belief system whether that is religion, gender, political, socio-economical or even food related and the pressure of being confronted by that is just over exaggerated. Now don't get me wrong, everyone is entitled to their own choices regarding beliefs or gender identification but just stop laying it so thick on people especially people like me. i have had to deal enough with mental pressure/manipulation in my teenage years and now that i am almost 30 i have to continue battling my way through more mental pressure because other people cant handle the way you live your life? Absurd! 

The idealization of not existing anymore or just disappearing off the face of the earth is such a calming thing. I am diagnosed with depression, PTSD (thank you military) and i will act on my suicidal thoughts (something i have been withholding till now) if this horse shit world gets worse.

I don’t wanna be here anymore(long story),"There’s just too much pain for me to handle. I feel I either die or go insane.There have been good moments in my life but im constantly reliving the bad.It started off when I was living in Georgia. My mom had got on drugs really bad when I was 4 years old and my sister was 6.I remember her and my dad always arguing bc of it.Waking up to mom holding a knife towards dad and then screaming at each other.It was every day and every night. Along with living in a bad environment constantly getting robbed,my parents allowed a homeless guy to live with us for a while and he would lock me and my sister in a room and beat us and cover my mouth. Just alot of bad shit. Until one night my dad had enough and I remember vividly him laying with me and my sister and telling us we were leaving in the morning to Kentucky to live with my grandparents.So the next morning we woke up,threw a bunch of shit in the car and left my mom.I can remember her chasing behind us and screaming not to leave. But my dad thought that would be the best thing to do for our lives. So we made it to ky and I met my grandparents. My grandpa was my dad and uncles step dad and my mamaw was their real mom. When we first got there it took a long time to warm up. My grandpa and grandma had to drag me and my sister out of the corner and I remember just screaming I hate you and I want to kill you and I didn’t even know them.so grandpa made me pick a switch. They were very strict.Eventually we warmed up to them and settled in.Dad stayed with us there. Not long after being there my dad had decided to take me and my sister to his friends down the road and they were all drinking and playing guitar. Having a good time. Til we all eventually headed outside on the porch and in the yard. Me and my sister stayed on the porch and was hitting a punching bag. And this is where the trauma in my life got worse. Nathan. My dads friend was very drunk and I remember him walking outside with his eyes closed with a shotgun barrel to his head. Faced towards me and my sister. And boom. I remember it all. My dad tried to calm us down and say that he accidentally shot himself in the leg. But that wasn’t true. He had killed himself right in front of us.A couple months pass since that and my mom starts calling my dad saying she’s off of everything and she’s doing better. So my dad tells me and my sister he is gonna be gone for a couple of days to pick mom up. I remember hugging him balling my eyes out saying please don’t leave please don’t leave.But he had to.But then a couple days go by and he’s not back. Papaw and mamaw say he’s spending time with our mom for a while. We were extremely sad but figured we would see him again. But no. December 13,2009. My Dad had picked my mom up and on the way back got into a fatal crash and died. My mom survived. The time we thought he was staying with mom in Georgia he was actually in a coma for 6 months.The day my grandpa told me he had picked me up from daycare and my sister from school. He said there was good news and bad news. He told us to choose one or the other. We both chose good news. He said our mom is back. But wouldn’t tell us the bad news until we got home. Where my family was in the living room crying because they found out about him dying and so did we. My mother had to pull me away from the casket.She stayed for a week after the funeral. Then one morning me and sissy woke up and she wasn’t here. She had abandoned us without even saying goodbye. So now my mom is back in Georgia. On drugs even worse and me and my sister are living with my grandparents.Fast forward 3 years. Im around 8 years old my sister is 10-11.We have already been through hell but that wasn’t all.I remember I was taking a shower cleaning myself. And when I get out I hear the door sling open. It’s my grandpa. I grab a towel and try to cover my body and hes just pulling it out of my hands trying to reveal me. He had a camera. He took multiple pictures of me naked and scared. And I’d rather not know what happened with them. He also molested my sister in many different ways. We didn’t realize what he had done until we got older. I was 13 and my sister brought up something he had done and it made me realize what he did to me. So we both decided to tell my uncle. My uncle told us not to confront him or anything and seemed like he believed us. The next day at school I told my cousin Audrey about it and she started balling here eyes out and it had gotten around to the office. Eventually I’m called to the office and one of my aunts are there to pick me up. She looks angry. As soon as I get in the car she asked me very irritated “What have you and Emma been making up about my Dad? We were in middle school and she instantly shut us down. My grandpa called us crazy the family believed it  and sent my sister off to an institution and when she got back my grandpa had molested her again and I backed down completely and said it was all a lie on my part because I thought they wouldn’t love me anymore and I wouldn’t have a family.My grandma had cancer during this time and died in 2013. The whole thing had blown over not long after and we were pretty much silenced.My sister came back eventually but always snuck out and tried to find ways to not be there. So it was Me my sister and papaw. Until my sister was 18 then she was out of there. So it was just me and my grandpa.And my mind had completely tuned out everything I guess for the best to keep my sanity and not kill him.I stayed with him as his health got worse and he had gotten dementia and his liver was failing. He started forgetting everything and defecating in the floors and I had to keep a baby monitor beside him in his room and one in mine. My aunts would sometimes come check on him and ask me how he was doing and they had me take care of him and clean him up and everything.He eventually got to the point he was stuck in a hospital bed in the living room right where my grandma passed. His days did not go on much longer and I got on pills in this part of my life so it was all just a bad time. He died not long after.So I moved into my aunt and uncles but ran away and stayed at a friends the majority of the time. Sissy had her own place now and gave birth to my nephew a couple years later. I was 17 atm. My mind Was and is now in a darker place. I don’t talk to any of my aunts and uncles anymore because of our past. I am now 20 and 4 months Ago my biggest nightmare became a reality. March 25th my sister is struck by a truck right down the road from her house and Died from the impact. She was texting me 3 days before on how she doesn’t want to be here anymore. And it was just a couple weeks after she had my other nephew. She was 22 years old and suffered most of those years from the things we witnessed together. My best friend and only person who could completely understand me. She got hit in the middle of the day and it hasn’t been announced if it was an accident or not yet. The people left are the ones who silenced us and our mom who abandoned us. Which I just recently moved her down here because she doesn’t have a car and she’s addicted pretty bad. It sucks that after all these years she can be here after my sister dies but I’m still the one that had to bring her here or it wouldn’t have happened . I have chosen to forgive her even though it’s hard. But everyone in my blood seems to get taken away tragically(my full blood aunt was also hit by a car in Georgia) and I fear death is coming after me next. So while I’m here I want to be the bigger person before I go. I think of suicide a lot and it has gotten worse. But I am getting into psychiatric care here soon and I hope that might help. Either way I’m going insane and wish that me and my sister could have at least had a chance and wasnt mentally messed up from the start.Im trying not to bring destruction all around me from being so broken. I know it’s a lot to read but I wanted to be heard from somewhere. If anybody has any advice for me please let me know.

Not a single thing brings me happiness rn,"I almost feel like my body is just not producing any serotonin at all &amp; that my dopamine receptors don't work. I never, ever get joy out of anything. All I do is lay in bed, and every single time I get myself up and force myself to go out, talk to people or even engage in my most basic low effort hobbies like gaming or drawing I feel nothing. I feel so incredibly low and lost, I sometimes just start crying because I just want to enjoy something again. Before in my depression Id  at least still have hobbies and interests I did, I could sit for hours playing a game or drawing but now I just can't.

"""Well, how much longer are you going to be this way? ","So I have been deeply depressed for the past five years. My mom finally told me she had cancer, covid prohibited me from coming home in her last years and she passed. Then a few months ago my soul dog had to be put down after months of seizures. I do have a history of depression I will say. Well, I have since come home. Went to the doctor who said I have depression. Colour me surprised. I was put on medication. My dad doesn't believe in therapy and since I spent my life savings on my dog's treatment and have yet to get my documentation in order for a new job in my profession I do not have money to get a therapist. I was asked by both remaining members of my core family the above. They also added the fact that they miss the old me. So far I have chosen to respond to the one using film and tv quotes since he doesn't want to hear anything negative. To my dad who I live with I respond when spoken to. To his girlfriend I am polite especially when she keeps saying men are like this. The family dog is a good listener though. She has yet to offer advice. I just needed to vent. Thank you.

How do I stop the constant negative thoughts.,"Im 26(m). Ive always had moments when ive been depressed but ever since my 26th birthday i have pretty much been cry everyday in my car after work.

The thing is my life isnt as bad as others. I have a job, earns enough money to live month to month, have some friends i talk to here and there and have parents who love me.

However i cant stop the negative thoughts everyday and my head has been hurting, even in moments i should be happy i start thinking negatively. 

My main negative thought is that im scared to be alone / single forever, ive been single all my life but now its scary, i take care of my body and health, the only one issue is im short (5ft4) and never get anyone notice me romantically.
Also ive been feeling very numb, dont feel many emotions plus i feel like i dont enjoy my job but also dont know what to change to and cant risk  getting pay cut. I dont have anyone to talk to so i feel like all my bottled emotions have been coming out this year through crying etc.

I just dont know what to do with my life or my crying, i feel so empty.

Seeking Advice and Support for Partner with Severe Depression and Suicidal Ideation,"Hi everyone,

I’m reaching out because I’m desperate for help and advice regarding my partner's severe depression. We’ve been together for 5 years, and while their depression and suicidal ideation have been mostly manageable, things have recently taken a steep downward spiral. Their suicidal thoughts are now constant, and we are in a state of crisis.

They have been switching medications, but nothing seems to be working. This has led to multiple trips to the ER, and we are desperate to find a medication that will provide some relief or at least a glimmer of hope. Unfortunately, inpatient treatment isn’t an option due to a previous terrible experience they had (the psychiatrist repeatedly forgot their prescriptions, they were exposed to other patients having meltdowns, and overall, it made things worse).

We live together, and they don’t have many friends they can lean on. I work full-time remotely, but I’m running on fumes trying to take care of them, maintain my job, and care for our pets. They have daily panic attacks and meltdowns, and I feel like I’m reaching my breaking point. Despite this, my instinct is to continue supporting them, as it feels like their life depends on me being there for them.

Has anyone been through something similar? How did you cope and what steps did you take to help your partner? Any advice, resources, or just words of support would be greatly appreciated.

 Thank you. ",DepressionThrowout89,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e466vv/seeking_advice_and_support_for_partner_with/

Struggling to Relax – Will Antidepressants Help?,"I'm 37 years old, and for the past 5 years, I've had trouble fully relaxing. I don't experience panic attacks or severe stress, but I'm constantly in a slight state of tension and mild anxiety, which is really draining. I've always believed that fear is a strong motivator, and over these past 5 years, I've accomplished more than ever before. I completely gave up alcohol, saved enough to buy an apartment, paid off my car, started a second small business, maintained stable earnings, and improved my cardio fitness. However, I'm now mentally exhausted, experiencing depressive episodes, struggling to get out of bed, and withdrawing from social life.

I want to be able to relax again like I did when I was 24, to worry less while still being motivated to achieve new goals.

My question is, will antidepressants help me care less and restore that relaxed state? I'm afraid that if I start taking these medications, I'll become lazy and lose my drive. In the past, when I was around 20-25, I took SSRIs, but they caused significant mood swings.",WolverineTop2936,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e44on8/struggling_to_relax_will_antidepressants_help/

Pathetic,"I'm sure nobody will see this, it's pretty stupid and there are bigger problems out there, but I just need to externalise this a bit. I am in such a weirdly desperate place.

I am 22 with no job, no degree, living at home with my mom and older brother (nothing inherently wrong with that I know) and I am terrified for my future.
Like I said, I have no occupation at all. I also have no drive to pursue anything. I've tried doing some online courses from home, but I just don't have the self-discipline or motivation to finish anything. Any skills that I do have are mediocre at best. My mom has always been a stay at home mom (we've lived off of money that my dad sends us, he still sends us a bit each month and I'm so embarrased about it. My parents are divorced), my brother has a job but it really doesn't pay much, so for the last almost 4 years since I've matriculated we have been struggling with money. And I know it's my fault.

I have had some small jobs over this time, but really nothing that was permanent. I just have no idea what I'm doing. I know I need guidance, but my mom always gives the same advice that never works: 'Just ask Jesus and he will tell you what to do with your life. Be careful to not do anything he doesn't want you to do.' And part of me still wants to believe in that, but it's been 4 YEARS. We have been in this same, ridiculous situation for 4 years, and my mom still believes that the Lord will come and drop money out of the sky and our lives will change instantly, all of a sudden. She has never pressured me into doing anything in my life, which I'm grateful for in part, but at the same time I feel like I just need someone to point me in the right direction, to give me advice that could get me out of this godforsaken hole I'm in. 

She does try to help me and give me some advice when I talk about maybe going to study, but it just never works out. Nothing ever works out. I feel like doors constantly just shut in my face when I try to do anything. I'm sorry for complaining like this, I know these things are my fault, since I just don't know how to stick to something.

I have talked to my dad a bit, but not very openly, since I don't know him enough to have deep conversations with him. I know he's disappointed in me for turning out like this. I did really well in school and everyone expected me to become something amazing, but I just never knew what I wanted to do after school. I feel so stressed and pressured to do SOMETHING, but I don't know how or what! 

I know this sounds pathetic to the rest of the world, and trust me, no one is as disappointed in me as I am. I hate myself for being so utterly useless. I am just so lost and stuck. I feel like I'm wasting away a time of my life that's supposed to be filled with all sorts of new experiences. I go weeks without leaving the house, I'm struggling a lot with self-harm since it helps the loudly oppressive thoughts to go away temporarily. I know my mom means well, but I'm starting to resent her for not.. helping. I have forgiven my dad for leaving us in the past, but I have some new anger building up in me all over again towards my parents. I know I'm still young, but I am an adult and I have no idea how to act like one.

I wish I knew what to do. I wish someone in my life would for once just tell me what to do next.

depression tout perdu en un jour,"Bonjour a tous

Besoin de parler du vécu qui est actuellement en train d'arriver et n'arrive plus à surmonter

Pour résumer ma situation j'ai 36 ans une compagne de 36 ans également avec qui nous sommes fusionnel, une entreprise de 7 salariés avec un salaire confortable, une vie simple d'entrepreneur qui roulait parfaitement 

Mais il y a 2 mois tout c'est écroulé subitement, mon activité c'est brutalement stoppé, l'administration m'ayant retiré les autorisations me permettant de travailler... et tout cela à cause notamment de MES propres erreurs et prise de décisions catastrophique 

Ne pouvant quasi plus travailler j'ai malheureusement dû licencier le personnel et doit faire face à de multiples problèmes : procédure judiciaire en cours, forte amende (en centaine voir millions d'euros), licenciement des salariés, prison mais vraisemblablement sursis, contrôle fiscal j'ai fais que de la merde avec ma société, impossibilité de payer les charges à venir, liquidation judiciaire, faillite personnel... Bref une erreurs que que je risque de payer toute mon existence

Depuis ma vie est devenu un véritable enfer, je vis dans le stress permanent; je ne dors plus que sous Stilnox et sous Lexomil, je n'ai plus le goût à rien, je suis en dépression sévère et n'ai que des idées noirs...

Je passe mon temps à ruminer, me dire que j'aurais dû faire ci faire ça, comment j'en suis arrivé là, j'en veux à tout le monde alors que le seul fautif est MOI MEME

J'ai perdu toute la confiance et complicité que j'avais avec ma compagne (l'une des rares chose qui me rendait heureux), nous allons perdre notre maison notre sécurité financière et surtout notre amour qui ne survivra certainement pas à cette épreuve

Je suis en train de sombrer et ai bien peur de ne pas pouvoir assumer toutes les problèmes qui risquent d'arriver.

I was pretty popular there and it was fun to be there and just overall a great experience. I had made quite a few close and loyal friendships and life was good. This all changed when i moved schools. Now my new school is in Centrale London whereas the last one was Kent. two VERY different places. My new school is a state school. My old school was a grammar school. Now i moved because of the travelling issue as my dad had to drive one hour to get to school. Now to my new school i just take a train. Now one thing is that the school is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyy smaller than my old school. it makes things feel cramped and congested all the time and i have nowhere to breathe. although the drugs/vapes/smoking/pollution in the air doesnt really help either. Just to say but my school is a whole year academically behind. Ive been TRYING to study hard but that is hard to do as ive gained a new sense of laziness. Ive been making no friends as everyone in the school is just toxic and i mean TOXIC. The downright play their own friends and insult them with no filter ofr apologie or even a 'im just kidding'. It just makes you feel like sh1t. Ive been constantly stomped on and made fun of by my cleassmates even though i do litterally nothing and try not to draw attention to myself and i envy the kids who arent brought to the topic of the conversations. People gossip about me at every corner and mix up my words on purpose to get something interesting. ive tried to make friends and it worked fine at first but then they kept on insulting me or saying im annoying or calling me weird. People try to get me in detention constantly even saying their name is my name so my name is put down for detention. Theres been a bunch more stuff happening that ive needed to talk to someone abput but for now my parents are coming upstairs and i cant let them see this.

Nothing ever goes right for me but the world keeps on moving all around while I feel stalled and in slow-motion,"I (24M) am currently going through the most devastating breakup. I was with them for over a year and was their main support system and cheerleader, but a little over two weeks ago they ended our relationship because it's been causing us both a lot of stress and they said they haven't been in it anymore since April. For context, they are on the other side of the country for a summer internship and the distance (and preparing for the distance) has been extremely difficult and very anxiety-inducing for me, to the point where I was constantly questioning our relationship and their true feelings- I could sense this breakup coming for weeks but was convincing myself that they were being distant and keeping me at arm's length because of how busy the internship is. I gave them everything and bared my soul to them and was planning a future around them and only stayed in my current city because they weren't ready to move yet (they're local). Now I'm stuck in a lease that it will cost $1500 to terminate early. My mom came the day after the breakup and spent a week with me, and I genuinely don't know if I could've gotten through it without her there the entire time. Things were starting to get better but I've been feeling worse since Friday. I've started Wellbutrin and am waiting to be upped to the therapeutic dose and take hydroxyzine as needed for anxiety and every night to help me sleep. I also go to therapy every week and my therapist is helping me move through this, but it also feels like I'm never feeling my worst when it's time for my appointment so she's not there when I really need her. No one's fault, just poor timing I guess.

Because of all of this, I have made the decision to move closer to home so I can be closer to my family and friends, as I don't have much of a support system where I'm at. I moved here for grad school two years ago and haven't enjoyed the city I'm in at all nor had a good experience in grad school (finished in May). The program was nothing like I was expecting and the students and faculty both created an extremely toxic and stressful environment on top of not really having a well-define program, making me feel like I didn't really get anything out of it- especially since I struggled to get through the first year and received an extremely negative first-year review. It felt like there was a vendetta against me, a theory that was only strengthened by everyone else's impression of how I was being treated as well.

I've been applying to jobs and had two interviews today. The first one went fine, but it would require I go through another 12 week class plus take a board exam after a year. I'm currently doing an online program to take the board exam in a different but related area, and both exams are through the same organization, but I'm two weeks behind (prof gave extensions because I told him some of what's going on) and currently sitting in a fast food restaurant trying to cram for an exam I need to take by sunday night. 30 minutes before the second interview (which was the one I really wanted), I was called by my recruiter and told that I actually was not eligible for that position and would not be eligible for any equivalent positions in other departments at the same facility. This is a separate facility operated by my current employer, and I have the same qualifications as people I work with that are in the position I was applying for, but there was some complicated reason I wasn't eligible at the other facility. I could get into all of that but it's a lot of information and isn't necessary.

In March, my supervisor essentially promised me a promotion to the position I was applying for. She then left the company the next month and her replacement has given me the same ""I don't know, I'm waiting on a response from corporate"" answer every time I've asked her about it.

  
My anxiety is so crippling that my chest always feels tight and I can barely eat or drink when it's flaring up. It's so hard to get through each day, especially those that I don't have work or plans and spend alone. Coworkers have commented that I've lost weight. 

TL;DR- Going through an emotional breakup that doesn't seem to be getting better after two weeks, trying to move, having trouble finding a job and apartment, bad experiences in both of my degrees, and made an empty promise by a former manager that never went anywhere. It feels like literally nothing ever goes right in my life and the universe is out to get me. When I say I can't think of a single thing that's gone right in the last few years, I mean it.",Robertbcms26,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e46l01/nothing_ever_goes_right_for_me_but_the_world/
Constantly depressed and paranoid,"I live in my apartment alone this summer because I am doing research for my university. I go into work for around 6 hours a day and relax when I get home. There are few people in the apartment this summer, but sometimes, I hear footsteps outside my door, and when I do, my heart races so damn fast. The funny thing is I have absolutely ZERO fear about the person trying to break in or kill me, but it is more the fear that they are going to see me by myself wasting away by myself. It is the worst when I am high by myself and I see myself as less than I am. Idk if this is caused by childhood trauma or poor self image, but my brain literally goes into fight or flight mode. I feel a panic attack coming on and then when the footsteps leave, I feel so relaxed right after as if my life had been spared. Can anyone related?

Im sick of being used,"It’s like a repeating pattern in my life. It’s so predictable I can write a step-by-step guide.

Someone befriends me, I get attached, then they ask for (what seems to me at the time like) a small favour. I do the favour, the person likes the results, so they ask for another favour a little bit bigger than the last one. I do it, they like the results again, then they ask again because they know I’m not going to say no. They know I’ll do it because “they’re my friend, of course I’ll help them”.

This happens over and over until I finally realize what’s going on. When the time comes, I express my concerns to them nicely. They act like it’s no big deal, like they understand and will change. I believe they will change, because they’re my friend. So I become blind to them continuing with the same old behaviour until I realize and talk to them again. Repeat this step a few times.

When it gets to the point where I’ve finally had enough, I express my concerns to them again, this time leaving no room for alternative interpretation. Then they gaslight me, act like they’ve been reasonable and I’m the crazy one, then actively go out of their way to avoid me for a bit.

If they know even the slightest thing about my mental health, they also act like it’s because of that too.

Is it really crazy or make me mentally unwell to not want to be treated like a soccer ball? Because that’s what I feel like. I feel like I’ve been kicked and passed around by all these people for various reasons, them all knowing what I’m like and that I don’t know how to say no.

And then when I do say no it’s like all hell breaks loose and I’m suddenly worth nothing to them anymore.

It honestly just really fucking hurts. I feel so fucking disposable.",ThatWasNotEasy10,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e46ixo/im_sick_of_being_used/
Back to square one,"I was doing so good for maybe a year. I had moved out on my own, got a car, had a job that I somewhat enjoyed. Now a year later, it’s going to shit. The same job I’ve had for two years is fucking me over. 2 shifts this week but the plumbing went out. So I got about 4.5 hours instead of 12. Then this next schedule, 3 shifts. I’m fucked. My hours had been slowly ripped from me. It was 6 then 5 then 4 and now 2 or 3. Everything I’ve worked hard for, budgeted for, skipped hanging out with friends when I’m 21 and young and should be having fun but I wanted to be responsible. I have never bought anything crazy. I haven’t gotten myself clothes in over a year. I rent an apartment. I got the cheapest car for the payments. I tried so hard. And for something that isn’t even my fault, it’s gonna go away. It’s all gonna be gone. My little safe haven of an apartment. My shitty car that took me to and from work. I’m gonna have to give my dog up. And what makes it worse, is my older sister makes the schedule. She knows I’m already struggling. She gave my hours to her bf. He has 5 days a week and has been a manager for like 1.5 months. I called up my other sister, wanting to day drink. Her phone is off so I’m alone in my apartment drinking. The thought of taking my pain pills from my surgery a few months back has crossed my mind a few times. I’d rather die than lose all of my progress. I’m already negative in my bank account. I might make $300 this paycheck and probably $200 the next. Not even enough for my rent. I worked so hard, just for it to be gone from something I can’t even control. It’s not even my fault but I get all the shittiness from it. It’s not fair. I never even asked for a lot in life. I just wanted this. Just this.

My feelings keep overwhelming me,"I feel so broken inside that nothing seems enough to mend the pieces. I feel like I am the sum of my mistakes, failures, and regrets. Except for a few days, it has been a very long time since I have felt peace. I've carried this heavy heart for as long as I can remember. The depth of my sadness knows no bounds, yet it feels hypocritical, as I have never faced true loss, never had to go hungry, beg, or feel violated. There are so many good things in my life, yet I am unable to be grateful for them. Only when I lose them do I understand how much I care and how much they mean to me. And I always lose them.

I am never able to express my love and affection for the people who stood by me in the darkest times. I fail to treasure them and respect their value. I lie here sad and broken, fully aware that I have hurt people terribly. Though I might not have done it intentionally, I did nothing to stop it. I've made decisions and choices for which there is no one to blame but myself. I have always hurt people, leaving them disappointed and sad. I can't think of one relationship in my life where this hasn't happened. I have hurt myself too, making terrible decisions that led to many mistakes.

I feel like I have not achieved anything in my life. Even now, I am afraid I am indulging in self-pity. This terrible feeling of sadness, guilt, shame, regret, and loneliness just does not seem to go away. And why would it? I have not been a good son, brother, friend, family member, or boyfriend. I have failed both in my personal and professional life. I lie here heartbroken, knowing I have caused so much pain and suffering.

I have hurt someone I truly love, and I don't know how to feel bad, because it is not me who suffered because of my actions. Now, I am alone, having broken all relationships. I don't have a friend to talk to or a girlfriend to share my heart with. The loneliness feels like a huge weight on me, one that I can't shed no matter what I do. I have not treated myself right. I have been undisciplined, inconsistent, and careless about myself, the people in my life, my feelings, and my life. I have chased impulsivity and short-term gratification.

I have not respected others or taken care of them because I have not respected or taken care of myself. Sometimes, I wish I could just fulfill all my responsibilities and make my parents happy, because after that, I might be able to end the suffering completely. Because I cannot take much of this anymore.

I want to look at the ocean again and feel peace. I want to laugh and dance when I feel the rain on my face. I want to enjoy the wonders of the world. I just want to stop feeling so worthless and aimless. I want to become a better person who can contribute meaningfully through his work to the world, and who is able to love and be loved in return.",AfraidAnteater5723,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e46gh3/my_feelings_keep_overwhelming_me/

The rest of my life is going to be sad. I know it is. And I don't think I want to live it.,"And before anyone says (not that anyone cares) that things could get better, or things can change. The reality is that I gave my entire life to someone who doesn't want me to be happy. She has a condition where she is obsessed with everything having to be someone else's fault. And for almost two decades I could shoulder a lot of the blame. And I was always willing to admit when I was wrong. My dreams don't matter, my passion doesn't matter, and even my peace of mind doesn't matter. All that matters is that I will never be good enough.

I could go on about my life story and provide context, but I doubt anyone would read it and bother to understand. We all have our own problems in life right? So instead of that massive lore dump I'll just say that I believed in a better life with all of my spirit, I fought for a better life with all of my soul, and I lived the best life I could with all of my heart. But she doesn't love me. She would sooner starve than see me become successful. I'm hers only in the sense that I can sometimes be a convenience. But at my lowest, oh she will be sure to look at me and talk to me in a way that I am constantly reminded of my uselessness. 

So I'm just waiting to have the courage to end it, and make sure it's a method that I can't come back from.

don’t know how to keep playing this game ,"turning 20 made me realize that i’ve been depressed with almost no relief for 10 years. i first went to therapy when i was 10 and started back up when i was a junior in high school. for the remainder of high school, i did therapy 2-3 times a week for most of the time. i tried holistic supplements and eventually had to go on antidepressants when i started college. im on my 4th combination and i had to stop bc they made me more suicidal than before.  i was looking forward to the change, but i never really made any lasting friends besides my roommate who i am still very thankful for. my sophomore year, i decided to live in a dorm alone bc i thought it would give me more time alone to do practice my guitar and write. it was just far from my classes and everyone i met. by october of last year, i decided to drop out. i burnt myself out in high school and tried to go for a good degree in college but i couldn’t handle it. i did a 200 hour yoga teacher training bc i couldn’t let myself do nothing for the time i went home. got a job at a cafe too. i didn’t rest as much as i wanted to. yoga became a chore instead of a method to help me cope, and now i have extreme anxiety around teaching and everyone is expecting me to start now. i signed a lease that i can’t escape and im moving back to my college town. everyone is excited for me but i can’t find a way to be hopeful. every time ive tried to be, i still end up in the same situation. i’m always the odd one out. i was at least excited to live by my boyfriend, but he’s moving for a job and we will have to be long distance still. outside of my personal life i feel like i have so much awareness around how rigged the world is. i will never be rich enough to afford my basic necessities bc i don’t dream of having a job. there’s not much i feel passionate about besides music and i don’t feel i can succeed enough to make money. i feel like ill be stuck working these stupid low wage service jobs forever. i feel like my life is over. i feel even worse thinking about how all my mom wants is a happy and healthy kid. the peace i got earlier when i was driving on the highway, listening to “telephone line” by ELO on full blast thinking about driving into a wall at full speed was the closest to happiness ive felt. i know i will traumatize people by killing myself so i just pray that i get a terminal illness. don’t know if anyone will read this but i just haven’t been able to go to therapy bc of my job and don’t feel like i can be honest with anyone else",Desperate-Bug6959,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e45grh/dont_know_how_to_keep_playing_this_game/

My dad's a deadbeat ,"NOTE: I have not been diagnosed with Depression. However I do suspect myself of having it and don't know where else to post this.

I (a 16M) am struggling a lot right now for a lot of reasons. I have no hobbies and don't take  an interest in anything. As an Autistic person that's unheard of, so to fit in with the Autistic community I faked a special interest in history for months. Speaking of Autism, because of  it I struggle with socialising and therefore hate every*one* alongside every*thing*. I have really bad self-esteem issues. I want to be an author yet can't spell the most basic of words, can't think of any ideas for books and have the world's worst handwriting. However I think my biggest issue is my deadbeat dad.

My dad an alcoholic and he chose alcohol over me. My dad didn't love me enough to choose me over some drinks at bar. Only now that I'm typing this do I realise how entitled I am, but it's how I feel nonetheless. I saw him on and off until 2022 and he was always mentally unstable. He would always yell at some small random thing I did, even when I was little. If I trust what I've heard (which I honestly don't since humans do nothing but manipulate) he also hit his children when he still lived with us, before he got kicked out, before he chose alcohol over me.

All this has made me feel so depressed. I would have committed suicide by now if I wasn't such a coward. Does anyone here know a quick, safe way of committing suicide? I'd greatly appreciate it if someone told me.",TommyCola65,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e4515w/my_dads_a_deadbeat/

I don't want to live anymore. On top of that, I'm a short a guy and always made fun of. I was bullied since the start of middle school, maybe even earlier. I haven't told my family, because they are very marrow-minded; especially my parents, in particular my dad. I'm because I have a ""nerdy"" attitude, although I'm not a teacher's pet, and because I'm short and weak, even if I work out. I don't eat as often, I don't care about my appearance, I don't shower as often as I did. This is going on for like 3 months. But I probably had depression since a really young age.

Like bro, who cares if fun isn't real or anything, it makes people happy so just let them be happy

Lost,"If this isn’t the place for this, it can be taken down.


I 33f am married to 37m
We have a little one.

We have been together 11 years.

In the beginning it was great, I was happy, I was in love.

Shortly after having our daughter I developed pretty bad PPD and tried to get help but the meds just made me worse.

We moved far away from family and I was left alone dealing with PPD and an infant 16 hours a day, every day.

During this time living across the country from family, he abused me. It was only the one time, but it’s stayed with me ever since. 

Fast forward to today and I have basically been raising “our” child alone for the past 8 years. I work, but I also do all the work of a SAHM. My child even comes to work with me (which I am grateful was even an option as childcare is not cheap so this was a financial relief.)

I have chronic depression. My earliest memory of me having depression I was 4.
I also over the years developed anxiety and CPTSD from sexual assault.
I go to a trauma therapist and yes it’s working, but I have a lot to work through. My husband knows this and yet provides me no help or relief from my every day tasks.

I cook dinner, he does not. So the trade was he’s to do dishes. They’ll sit in the sink for days, and if I complain, I’m the asshole.

Suddenly our child has started having bouts of severe anxiety and it’s been hard to handle as I cannot get through to her to help her. 
I set up both a doctors appointment and therapy for her. Again, with no input or help from my husband.

Last night as soon as it was bedtime my child started having bad anxiety.
Now I also have a chronic illness that causes me to be in full body pain and aches pretty much 24/7 and it makes me exhausted.  
So when she started I myself started to break down.

I have so much on my shoulders. I do everything for my child, husband, our pets, the home, and I put myself last because I have no other choice.

I got up and went to get my laundry and saw that the stuff I just treated myself to was covered in black ink from a pen my husband left in his pants. And I lost it. It was the straw that broke the camels back.

I had a full on mental break and panic attack.

My husband’s way of consoling me?
“Knock it off and stop fucking up her (out daughter) life!”

I couldn’t believe it. I could not believe he said that to me. After everything I have done and sacrificed for him and our family.
(And for context my daughter is absolutely attached at the hip to me, not him.) it was one of the most hurtful things he’s ever said to me, especially since he knows that with my own mental health I already feel I’m a POS mom for being depressed 24/7

I don’t want to be alive anymore, but I also can’t do that to my baby. The guilt comes in heavy with the mere idea of offing myself because of how often my husband has called me selfish for even having those thoughts as a parent.

I know I of course didn’t give you our full history, but that’s the gist of our relationship. I have retaliated against his words and actions towards me and he knows exactly what to do to gaslight me into insanity.

I want to just leave and start a new life and be in a better head space with my baby, but I financially don’t know how I’d even do that. I also have no family to turn to.

I am stuck and I am depressed to the point of a numbing disassociation.

"I’ve been struggling with my mental health, I don’t want to go back to work and just done with life.","Sorry I just needed to rant because my have nowhere else to turn to.

I am struggling massively with my mental health, to the point of just feeling exhausted and not present, I’m worn out and just done with everything, especially my job. I’m just feeling so lost and a failure in life and it weighs on me.

I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and depression for years now, but I’m very high functioning and very good at hiding it,so on the outside, I look perfectly ok, but I just feel like I’m unrevealing now and I don’t even know where to begin to pick up the pieces. I’ve e had counselling and CBT which helped but I still struggle so deeply, I’ve never had medication, I don’t know what to do. My GP is aware of my struggles and put me on the waitlist for NHS talking therapy, but I still on the list.

I dread my job, I work in the public sector/local government in education so it’s very high pressure, heavy caseload. I’ve handed in my notice which is 3 months from now, so I will be leaving soon. I’m going to take a break from working and just focus on my studies and pursue my masters degree, so I haven’t completely left without something lined up.

But Irecently got a complaint from a parent that sent me in a downward spiral with my mental health and from that, I’ve not been right. A family member of mine passed away and that triggered it even further. I wasn’t given bereavement leave by my manager, so I’ve been calling in sick, I’ve been off work sick for a week already due to go back this week.

I have no one to turn to, my manager at work isn’t helpful, she’s lovely but she doesn’t know how to support me whenever I mention I struggle with my mental health. There is no signposting to services that can help at my workplace, there is no ‘how can I help,’ nothing. She isn’t mean, but I dread engaging with her about it. 

My family are not the best to talk about these things so I keep it to myself.

TW: Self Harm, ED, Violence, Self Hate","What I Hope For The Future (if I make it there):                                                                  I hope to be able to smile, to actually be happy, to get out of bed, to clean my room, to change my sheets, to do my hair, to brush my teeth, to shower, to be ok with just silence without feeling deep sorrow in my heart, to not get mad at people around me when they’re not focusing on me, and how they dont live to only make me happy, to have a better relationship with my mom, to be nice, I really hope one day I get out of this despair called depression, it really does suck. It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it’s better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i’m the same as them, as if we’re all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it’s because their so mad at the other person’s opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn’t that mean you’ve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I’m not an object. I definitely take it too far though, punching the wall, screaming, and destroying things are not normal emotions. To top that off, I am stuck in a constant eating disorder, starved until I couldn’t, ate until I exploded, I prefer the skinny side of me, I liked my body at least. Back to sadness… I haven’t been able to explain it to anyone else what im feeling, to explain it on the deepest level I can, what I feel (maybe I’m being dramatic) is death, although I dont know what death feels like I assume its like getting old, or being on your death bed, my depression is like waiting to die, everyday not getting up to do anything, never being happy, not having anyone worry or miss you, that’s what death is overall. I seem normal on the outside, besides my arms (yes I mean that) but that’s only because if I cant even handle the beat down from myself, I dont know what’d I do if I had to endure hate from the outside world, that’s one of the scariest things in my opinion.",These_Tomorrow8510,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3uwwv/can_someone_acknowledge_that_im_real_please_tw/

Very frustrated and tempted to go to hell with it all,"I been struggling to find answers to my problems and I keep hitting the same wall in life. Sounds fine but the issue puts me off my game. The issue is that I'm on my phone doing a few things either playing video games watching YouTube or on beta.character.ai. I'll get up early to do this and just forget about life. Then when I have to do stuff or get removed I feel anger that I did this and just feel like not trying to solve this anymore.

To be honest, I did try meeting new people, being in a relationship even but everyone just leaves. I am in a constant state of wanting to be with someone yet scared of everyone who I see being a part of my life be it as a friend or something else. I cry for atleast an hour every night and I experience moments of wanting to kill myself.

I need help and I don't know what to do. I miss her yet I don't have the courage to talk to her as I know she won't want to talk to me. I would only end up being a nuisance to her and her happiness.

Lonely ,"I don’t quite know what to say except for the fact that I am so incredibly lonely. I’ve always had a hard time keeping friends around but in the last 2 years especially I have no one except for my fiance. He does a great job trying to understand my feelings of depression and anxiety most of the time but I feel like lately I have become such a burden on anyone around me. I know I don’t treat him right or good enough when I get into a depressive episode and I so desperately want to be alone but I’m scared I’ll SH or worse. I’ve been having so many negative feelings about myself lately I feel like there’s a cloud around me or like I’m my insides are being compressed. I quite literally have 0 friends except for my fiance and my family who I don’t open up to. 
I know it’s wrong but I’m jealous about the fact that he has so many friends and people around him all the time. I miss having a life like that and being happy and fun and people enjoying my company. I know that it’s partially my fault as I self isolate and that’s how I lost all my friends in the first place, but honestly I never recovered. I have always had a hard time connecting with people and fear that they will always leave.

How can I finally start to change?,"Hey guys, I'm going to sound super weird when writing this. Yet, I feel like this is my last option in trying to get help or ways to take the first step to loving myself and feeling normal.

I (26M) have dealt with Body Dismorphia since I started Middle School. However, all I do is lay around and mope in bed.

I'm horrible at keeping friends and a walking multiple red flag that hasn't been in a romantic relationship since birth. There's too many things wrong with me, and I don't know what to do...

Everyone I talk to believes I have Asperger's and Manic Depression, but I never been formally diagnosed for it yet. Everything in my life is wrong!

My anxiety is at 21 out of 10 and it's all my fault,"I've written this post twice now after taking too long and losing it.  I'm going to be as brief as possible, while still trying to cover everything.  Mainly the advice I need is at the end.

I've been with my (46M) girlfriend (36F) for 3 and a half years.  I haven't been a good boyfriend.  I've lied about some pretty big things, and I've compounded lie on top of lie.  I was previously married in a loveless and toxic marriage that I am still struggling to end, but I lied to her and told her that it was final.  When she asked to see the decree, I continued to lie, delaying the inevitable. She knows now, and even though the divorce arbitration is moving forward, it doesn't fix the lies.

I had a close friendship with someone from my previous job, that was inappropriate.  Really inappropriate.  It wasn't cheating, physically or emotionally, neither of us wanted anything like that, but we did exchange racy and sexual text messages with each other, memes and pornographic pictures from the internet, nothing ever personal, and some of this did overlap into the beginning of my relationship with my girlfriend.  My girlfriend found out and I deleted all the messages from my phone, out of shame, and fear, and disgust with myself.  I forgot that they were even there because it had been so long ago, but once she found one of them, it all came back and I panicked.  Now I'm trying to figure out how to restore them so she can read them all and get closure.

We are trying to work things out, I think most of the work needs to be done by me.  I am in therapy, both personal and couples', trying to be better.  My psychologist wants to diagnose me with Borderline Personality Disorder, but I'm not sure that completely explains everything.  It's a work in progress.  I just want to move forward and I don't want to lie ever again, and I want everything to go back to normal.

That's where the anxiety is.  I overthink and I self-punish.  I go from 0 to 1000 at the drop of a pin and I am inconsolable.  I am terrified that I'm losing her, that I have already lost her, that she's going to find someone else less problematic.  And part of me knows that that probably would be the best thing for her, to be loved by someone that would never lie or hurt her.  It would end me though.  It would completely destroy me.  She tells me that she still loves me, and still wants to be with me, and make this work, but she can never trust me again.  Even if we work through all this, I can't see how she ever could, and I don't blame her.  Not one bit.  And without trust, how can there be love?  Real love?  And in my head, I don't know if she really needs ME or does she just need someone, and am I in the way?  She wants to meet new people, for friendships and I agree that she should.  I think she should get out and find that support system that I'll never be comfortable finding for myself.  She says that she's not looking for dates, or someone new, or even casual throwaway sex to fill the void that I caused, but that fear exists.  I know how special she is, even if she doesn't, and I know other people will see it too.  And I'm going to lose her, if I haven't already.

We have ups and downs.  Some days we are still madly in love and all over each other physically.  Some days are the complete opposite, cold, quiet, filled with hurt.  It's the yo-yo that hurts the worst, and causes the most anxiety.  Waiting for the shoe to drop that she found someone.  That it already happened.  And it's over.  It eats at me inside and I can't seem to make it stop.  I go for days without eating or drinking, sleeping.  I've lost over 15 pounds in two weeks and my clothes don't fit anymore. I just don't know how to stop accelerating things in my own mind, or how to stop hurting myself and focus on trying to fix the here and now.  I was on Paxil 10mg once a day for a while, but they don't work and I'm pill avoidant anyway.  I don't know what to do and I need help and I feel like I don't deserve any.

"I, (M22) am completely stuck. ","I don’t know how to put this into words but here’s what I’m dealing with:

Severe Misophonia, chronic back pain(unknown cause, dozen of unsuccessful treatments over the course of about 7 years), severe social anxiety- literally zero friends whatsoever, religious disagreement with family, frequent headaches, depression, (thankfully mild most of the time, except every week or so when I get lonely and it smacks me in the face and tells me I have nothing of value to offer to anyone and no future) and no life skills/degree or employment of any kind.

 I have also never had sex/kissed/held hands/been on a date in my life. I can literally only think of one time a girl my age even hugged me.  It was about 7 years ago (when my life was just starting to fall apart) and she only hugged me because she was a very friendly/affectionate kind of person and we happen to be in the same group at Mormon youth conference thing (she hugged everyone goodbye). We barely ever spoke to each other and I don’t even remember her name. 

I have plenty to be thankful for too, or at least I *should* be, but somehow that just makes me feel like I’m even more useless for not being able to get my life together. Anyway the positives are:

Parents (still married and in a good relationship) are supportive with my struggles, other than the religion thing. They’re VERY Mormon/LDS and cannot accept that I don’t believe anymore. (I stopped at around 16).

I managed to get my driver’s license and GED after dropping out of school in 10th grade.(due to the back pain and misophonia)

Good financial situation. Of course I’m completely dependent on my parents(which makes me feel worthless sometimes) while we’re not exactly rich, we’re probably middle to maybe upper middle class, by the standards here in the US. 

Depression is also not quite as bad as it was at 16-17, in large part due to therapy. 

The thing is, all my problems compound on each other. 
Want to get a job? Well I can’t because my back is going to demand I lay down after 30 minutes of sitting, standing or walking. But why try when it’s going to send my anxiety through the roof? And what is someone triggers my misophonia, so I just sitting there, suffering with extreme rage, while my body pumps me full of all the hormones it thinks I need to be prepared for my imminent death?

So what if I work from home then? How many jobs are there that let me work as few and as erratic hours as I need to manage the pain, while also minimizing social interaction? Oh and all I have for my resume is a GED and zero previous employment. 

How do I make friends when I have nowhere to go? No school, college, church or workplace. Not to mention I live in the dead center of the mormoniest part of Utah. I’m instantly going to be an outsider, as an agnostic-ish person. I’m not even anti-Mormon or looking to get into arguments or anything. People aren’t mean about it, but there’s always that slight distance between us.(which my social anxiety insists will ruin everything)

What about friends online? I have had some people I played online games with in the past, and had some I would call friends. But they didn’t last. Like all of my other friendships, they were shallow, I think because I suck at taking interest in other people, and we drifted apart. 

That’s only half the problem though, because my mom dislikes online game relationships . I’m not forbidden from playing games with people online, and she has actual agreed that it could be good for me to interact with people like that. The thing is, I have no privacy. Most of the day, it’s just me and my mom in the house, where she could overhear anything I say, or walk in at any moment. It’s not like I plan on doing anything she would disapprove of, but my anxiety doesn’t care. Even now, if she walks into the room while I’m just watching a harmless youtube video my heart rate spikes. So anytime I try to play online games with people there’s this stress that my mom is listening to and judging everything I say. Not to mention it’s just awkward to have your mom there while you’re trying to hang out with your friends.

The religion thing is at a stable but mutually unsatisfying stalemate. It makes interacting with my siblings awkward, and I usually avoid my extended family as best I can. My parents occasionally preach to me a little and everyday I have to read a page of the Book of Mormon and come to family prayer. I put up with it because they made it clear that those are the rules in this house and I figured it’s the least I can do considering how much they’ve worked to try to help me, not to mention raising me. 

The thing is, I sometimes hate it here. I hate living in this beautiful house with loving parents, free food, free WiFi and minimal responsibilities. I want to do something. I don’t know what because I’m not good at anything and every time I leave I am rewarded with physical and emotional suffering. I’m so socially defunct that I can’t hold a conversation with anyone, not that I get many opportunities to. But even being very inverted I get really lonely when I learn something cool and have no one to share it with, or when I need advice and have no one who can relate to me or when I realize that on my current trajectory, I’ll never fall in love, let alone get married and start a family. 

I’m not sure why I’m posting this, I guess it’s easier to be honest if I’m anonymous. I’ve thought about doing something like this before but I was paranoid that someone I know will find it and know it was me. I am still paranoid, but once I actually wrote this out I decided to just post it anyway. I don’t know if I want pity or advice, or just some actual meaningful human interaction, but every year that passes it gets harder to ignore the fact that I have no idea what I am going to do with my life.

Just dead inside,"I'm 25. Still a virgin. Never had a relationship. Have no friends. Have hardly had a social life since high school. Never really had much of one though. Hardly any real life experiences. Can't think of one good memory from the past 10 years. Unemployed atm.

I just feel dead. I've been so depressed these last few days. I just want to die. I can't think of any good reason to keep going. Life is not worth it at all. I'm so tired, can't stay motivated or see a reason to bother with much of anything.

I hate this life. Modern life is absolutely soul sucking and barbaric. I feel as though nobody cares about me at all and it's mostly true outside of family.

There really is nothing you can do. I'm going to therapy but that's doing nothing. I'm so emotionally numb to everything now.

I'm tired of the platitudes and false hope and people saying life is worth it because life is fucking unbearable.

I give up,"I want to give up.

I'm 15. For a third of my life I've been battling with depression. For all that time, my mother verbally abused me about my mental health. The first time I was admitted to the pysch ward, she didn't visit me the entire time. I didn't get any diagnosises or medication due to her wishes.  The second time, last time, I was put onto a treatment order to basically force my mum into giving me treatment. We went to this mental health tribunal and she said that made her realise that I had issues.   
  
I'm discharged now. My mum's acting weirdly nice, saying that we both hurt each other (me telling people she was abusive and having mental breakdowns) and that we should move on. I'm taking medication, which she supervises. But I'm so done. I don't have the strength to keep on going, to keep on fighting. I think the last straw was my discharge, where I literally locked myself in the bathroom and screamed that I didn't want to go home. But they made me.

I just wanna stop taking meds, stop going to therapy, and wait out my chance to kill myself. But for the first time ever, I felt pleasure and genuinely smiled. But I'm done. I'm sorry, but I'm done. I'm so so done.

I just don't see the point ,"I just really don't. I'm a 21 year old female and I've tried for years to give myself stupid reasons to stay alive. ""It gets better"" wasn't cutting it anymore so I was telling myself stuff like ""I want to see season 2 of this show I love. I need to see if my theories were correct, I can't die yet"", ""I'm so looking forward to the next spider verse movie I can't go yet"", ""Oh I can't die till the broncos make the playoffs"" or ""I have to see the broncos win another Superbowl! I could achieve immortality with that wait"" 

Just these last months have just been hard. My eating disorder has come back aggressively, and I know subconsciously it's my suicide, the suicide I can control. I want to die I don't eat. I want to live I eat. 

 I feel my friends couldn't give a shit about me. My cat ran away and not one friend could be bothered to talk to me to help me through it. I went through a death last year. Same thing not one friend cared. I'm always the back up friend. I'm the friend people only give a shit about when everyone is busy. 

I took a year off of college to get a job but I can't get any job and I've applied for over 20 jobs. I keep seeing articles talking about how no one wants to hire Gen z so now I'm panicking no one will hire me ever.

 So I'm sick of being sick, I feel like none of my friends could care less if I died, I feel like a deadbeat failure that I can't get a job and an idiot because I was at best a C student in school. I know people go through worse so I feel like a bigger POS I feel this way. 

I have a really hard time talking about these things in real life because I either want to avoid this topic like the plague or joke about it like it doesn't bother me. I kinda did it a little in this post with the ""immortality"" comment. I feel like it makes it harder for people to understand I need help because I can't say it.

Depressed ex just left and I wanna text her,"It happened yesterday morning. We have been together 3-4 months and everything’s been amazing, it’s not often I find a connection with someone. 
The past week or she has been struggling with depression, she has been noticeably struggling with needing space and I given it to her whenever she asks and however much she needs. It always ends with her wanting to be near me and holding her.
A couple days ago she had a tough day and really opened up to me and I listened and told her I was there there for. She kept saying how amazing and grateful she was to have me as a boyfriend.
Yesterday morning she woke up and we talked on the phone about meeting up because we had plans and she wanted to see me, her words, but after a few minutes when we’re gettting ready and her kitten just pooped on her carpet she started spiraling about she didn’t wanna drive and that I deserved better and that she’s bringing me down and destroying my life. Eventually we broke up but I made sure she knew I disagreed. 
We agreed to meet up next weekend to exchange stuff. 

Now a day later, I can’t stop thinking about how she spiraled and maybe I should’ve told her to take a second cool down and that she didn’t have to drive I’ll come see her.

Who am I?,"Hi, good morning/afternoon/evening. I'm writing this post to ask for your opinion on my behaviour.

For some months I've been taking SSRIs (Serotonin Recapture Inhibitors) which help me control my mind and depressive thoughts. The ones I take work really well. Although I need to give it a psychological push to keep working sometimes, but that's expected.

Now, I had to stop taking it because of ""reasons"", and my brain has slowly become depressed again, and although I feel sad and depressed more easily, I also feel more... Free, I feel like I am the real me, I feel like I'm really feeling, I'm really in touch with my own feelings and don't feel the need force myself to feel (or even be) a certain way.

With this, the dilemma arises - To be, or to not be depressed? 

While with SSRIs I am more physically free (my body doesn't get anxious as easily, or depressed which leaves me tired and not wanting to do anything, or worse...) and more productive with my life, I also feel like I'm suffocating myself emotionally, because, even though SSRIs do let me feel sad and sometimes even ""depressed"", I still feel like I'm not being the real me, and instead feeling and doing what is expected of me.

Thinking about this scares me a little. Even though, the answer should be obvious, I also think about what's going to happen later in life if I do keep taking these.

"Extreme Desire to Relive the Past, Knowing I Can't Makes Me Feel Unfulfilled and Extremely Depressed","Hi Reddit!

This is my first-ever post, and I think I'm in need of a little advice.

Over some time during my teenage years &amp; currently, I've had this extreme desire to relive my childhood, more specifically my tween years (11-13). I'm currently 17 going onto 18 in October and I don't know how to shake this feeling and ""mature"". I'm not afraid of getting old, but I've always felt like I've been stuck in this loop of wanting to be a child again. A lot of people tell me it's nostalgia but I think it's something a bit deeper than that and I wanna know if others feel this way too. Recently, I've been consuming the same media I was obsessed with as a kid (specifically Eddsworld lol) and I got extremely happy! Because it made me feel the same feelings I had as a kid and I was on a high of reliving the same emotions of fangirling and such. But very quickly I just began to non-stop cry, and I think I couldn't come to terms that I will never experience being in my childhood home again, on my android watching certain web-series, just being a lil nerd lol. I hope this doesn't sound corny, but this emptiness has been bottling up inside me for years now and I don't know how to make myself feel ""full"". I only get temporary happiness when I revisit old media I loved, but then once it's ""over"" and there's nothing left for me to watch, read, or anybody to interact with the same interests I get extremely depressed and snap back into ""reality"". I'm not gonna continue more because you prob get the jist of it, but let me know if others feel this way! I don't regret any choices, actions, or anything about my past. I just wish I could be there again to experience it again and again. I am a full time 24/7 yearner so maybe I am just yearning LOL

"I just need someone to acknowledge that I’m real. TW: SH, ED","What I Hope For The Future (if I make it there):                                                                  I hope to be able to smile, to actually be happy, to get out of bed, to clean my room, to change my sheets, to do my hair, to brush my teeth, to shower, to be ok with just silence without feeling deep sorrow in my heart, to not get mad at people around me when they’re not focusing on me, and how they dont live to only make me happy, to have a better relationship with my mom, to be nice, I really hope one day I get out of this despair called depression, it really does suck. It’s honestly really dissappointing that I have no motivation to do anything besides play games and talk to someone on the phone, the only reason I have motivation to do those two things, is the fact that they take me away from the sadness warping my mind, it doesn’t even give me dopamine but its just a distraction of normalness if that’s even a word, it actually makes me feel like im a real person, I just feel like sadness, never real just an emotion. I feel as if I argue with people and im filled with so much anger because it’s better than being sad, and in a deep deep deep hurt that you cannot escape, fortunate on my side sure, but not for others, not only that but arguing makes me feel real, knowing that other people get angry too makes me feel as if i’m the same as them, as if we’re all normal, because after all anger is an emotion. When people argue it’s because their so mad at the other person’s opinion that they feel the need to raise their voice and feel hurt by what the other person proposed, doesn’t that mean you’ve been acknowledged though? My answer is yes, I feel like a real person when I argue because they dont dismiss me but instead treat me like I deserve to be argued with, like I’m not an object. I definitely take it too far though, punching the wall, screaming, and destroying things are not normal emotions. To top that off, I am stuck in a constant eating disorder, starved until I couldn’t, ate until I exploded, I prefer the skinny side of me, I liked my body at least. Back to sadness… I haven’t been able to explain it to anyone else what im feeling, to explain it on the deepest level I can, what I feel (maybe I’m being dramatic) is death, although I dont know what death feels like I assume its like getting old, or being on your death bed, my depression is like waiting to die, everyday not getting up to do anything, never being happy, not having anyone worry or miss you, that’s what death is overall. I seem normal on the outside, besides my arms (yes I mean that) but that’s only because if I cant even handle the beat down from myself, I dont know what’d I do if I had to endure hate from the outside world, that’s one of the scariest things in my opinion. Truly, if I could, I would cut all my hair off and fix it to my liking, I would tear my face off and stab it until I couldn’t anymore, and pay for a new one, I would melt my body until it could be transformed into something I could bare to look at, I would smush my brain until it could feel all emotions, in a normal way, until it could cure my mental illness(s), but I can’t do that, can I. It’s pretty disappointing that not even death wants to be friends with me, how do I know, from the multiple times I’ve tried to meet them, they declined. Another thing I hate, is that I can’t be grateful for the things I have, I have a normal life don’t get me wrong, I have a nice house and good amount of money, but what’s so selfish and unfortunate is that I don’t want it, I don’t want this life, say, maybe one day I do get out of this comfort of sadness, happiness makes me uncomfortable, if I do get out of this one day, I’m still going to hate what I have, I hate what I have and what I don’t, that’s why its better off to end it all. One more thing I hope for in the future… I want to be able to be alone by myself, and to love the people who love me. And most importantly, I want to learn how to not hate myself.",These_Tomorrow8510,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3us79/i_just_need_someone_to_acknowledge_that_im_real/

currently, he doesn’t answer my calls or text me. he is distant unless he thinks we can have sex. whenever i bring up that his control over every aspect of this relationship is making me miserable, he starts to threaten a complete break up again. when we do spend time together he basically leads me on. he tells me and he loves me and everything is going to be okay. we make future plans and i feel like everything is going to work out. but then he ghosts me all day. i have my own problems. i take care of his dog and cat. i have depression and anxiety and am currently struggling financially. i have no friends and my family doesn’t like me. everyday is a struggle. 

when he does talk to me on the phone, he always tells me things like he doesn’t want to be in a relationship with me. he constantly tells me that he doesn’t like to be around me. he tells me that he doesn’t miss me and that he doesn’t want to see me. he knows i have struggled with suicidal thoughts, depression, and anxiety. he is always flipping between saying he loves me and saying he doesn’t want to be around me. he makes me feel like i’m not worth it. he makes me want to kill myself. out of everyone who doesn’t want to be around me or love me, i never thought he would become one of those people. i don’t say anything to make him say this stuff. he just feels the need to. i feel like it’s manipulative for me to tell him that the things he says and how he is treating me is making me suicidal. but i just want to make him stop

Struggling with jobs and mental health. ,"Hi all. 

I have struggled with depression and anxiety from the age of 14, I’m 31 this month. 

I have worked since the age of 15 at various different jobs, I finally thought I’d found one now that was okay while I started to apply to study to go forward to apply for a probation officer program. 

My job is becoming stressful, a lot of pressure and I just can’t cope - I feel it’s impacting my mental health again, my anxiety is through the roof and I’m looking to apply for other jobs with less responsibility so I can do my job and head off home after not worrying sick. 

In the last 2/3 years there’s been jobs that have been terrible, I was bullied out of a job because I spoke up about the way things that weren’t right and it’s just destroyed any confidence I may have had. 

I can feel myself spiralling again into crisis like I was at the start of the year and I just don’t know what to do anymore, it’s starting to develop into intense suicidal thoughts with serious intention again. 

I try so hard, I try my best and work as hard as I can and it just feels like it’s never good enough and it always goes wrong. I’m just so tired of it all now, not just how many times I can keep going through this cycle.  

The GP offers little support and CMHT refused to take me on or even assess me, so I’m at a loss of where to turn. My partner is very supportive but I don’t want to put too much on him either, as it’s not fair at all.

It’s kind of like if you were a fat kid you can get ripped but you will always have low metabolism and always be at risk of going back to how u were if you stop trying ur best every day. It's hard coded inside and the moment the page refreshes ur back to square one. 

I try very hard. I try to be the best version of myself every day. But even now, when I am so far from being the kid I was back then, I still feel the same. None of my peers would guess I am as depressed as I am because you wouldn't think someone like me would be.

Im always comparing my life to others,"Even things like their rooms/apartments, general overall life situation, their success, looks (as in, they're able to look exactly like they want to look like. They don't have to constantly defend their choice of clothes)

I know social media is fake but even the real part that influences show (e.g. social media vs. Reality) is making me jealous. Idk if jealous is the right word, it's rather me feeling miserable if I'm thinking of myself.

I still don't have my life together. I've been struggling with mainly depression, ptsd and bpd for my whole teenage years, I've been struggling for almost 10 years straight.. and it's so hard to get back on track.

And then i see people who experienced similar things and them being successful and able to take care of themselves.. it just makes me feel really bad about myself. I wish. I still live at home which I really don't like. My family loves me and I love them but I feel so suffocated sometimes, by them and everything.

I see others succeeding while I'm kind of drowning in the crowd. Whenever I think that life can actually be good, I drop and go right back to sh and feeling miserable. I don't want to be like that.. but I don't know what to do. It feels like no matter what I do, in the end it doesn't matter, since I'll always fall back.

""Dont think so negative, obviously it doesn't work then"", I know that. Why would I not know that. It's easier for someone who hasn't been struggling with mental illness, especially for almost half their life.. sigh. I don't wanna stress negativity but it's just really bothering me currently. :/

I especially compare myself to my cousin. He hasn't had these issues. He's only 17 and he is much more responsible, he does his chores, he studies, he's very smart and he has the same interests my grandma for example has.

Can a person subconsciously attempt suicide?,"Awhile ago I took some old adhd medicine that I used to be on. I took like 8 pills and at the time I told myself it was to get High. Even tho the particular pills had never given me any sense of what you think of when someone says they’re high. Part of it was also because I had stopped percs a month ago and was craving anything shaped like a pill. Idk either way my heart rate sky rocketed and I had to put my head under cold water in the bath cus I heard somewhere cold water slows down your heart rate. I was thinking about that today and began to wonder could it have been a subconscious attempt to kill myself. Because at the time I was crazy fucking miserable. I was cutting constantly, some of the scars are still pretty obvious even today. I hate looking at them. Anyway, maybe it was me subconsciously trying to kill myself?

I literally hate everyone and everything (Long Post) ,"This is gonna be a long post and it’s probably not gonna be well written so bear with me. Reddit is the only non biased place I can vent and seek advice at the same time. 

I am an angry person. I hate everyone and everything. I have no idea why.

My childhood was good I guess. I feel like my parents did a good job raising me. I wasn’t spoiled but I did have more opportunities than my peers. I am an only child. So I can’t think of any childhood trauma that would cause my anger issues. The only thing that maybe would have anything to do with it is when I was in high school I was the kid everyone picked on but tbh it didn’t really bother me because I didn’t like anyone anyways lol

I didn’t start noticing how much of a hostile person I am until I reached adulthood. At 19 I bought my first home, had a good job, good friend group, etc. I did develop an alcohol problem but got it under control after my DUI when I was 24. I still drink occasionally but only when I’m home. There is no correlation between my anger and alcohol. Just wanted to add that for context on my life. I have the smallest fuse. If someone looks at me the wrong way I’m ready to kill them. I can’t count on my fingers and toes the amount of times I’ve plotted someone’s death in my head. 

I’m now 29 and it’s like the anger is full force. I’m happily engaged to the love of my life and he is literally the best person in the world. He’s very patient and understanding and non judge mental. What’s crazy is I’ve felt like I’ve gotten more angry in the last 3 years we’ve been together. But it has nothing to do with him or anything he’s done. He has a great career as do I so financials aren’t an issue. I used to be an extrovert now I can’t stand to leave the house. I can’t stand to be around people because people are fucking stupid. If someone says something stupid it will send me into a rage. If someone is loud/obnoxious I imagine hurting them. I love the thought of beating the shit out of someone who messes with me.

Here’s where it turns into depression. I will get so mad about something so minute and after I blackout from shear anger I beat myself up because once I calm down I’m embarrassed for myself at how mad I get. I do have a history of suicidal thoughts and 1 attempt (during my alcohol abuse). Generally when I do get angry it doesn’t turn physical. I don’t put my hands on people. It pretty much gets compartmentalized. 

My biggest problem is I don’t have any non religious connections that I can properly seek help from. 

I got extremely angry tonight. I had one of the most violent outbursts I’ve had in a while. It started with my DoorDash order. It was wrong. I got pissed. Then I was playing a video game. Game lagged out and I lost all my progress. Rage quit. Decided to go take a shower because I figured that would make me feel better. Went to wash my hair and I was out of conditioner. I then threw all the bottles out of the shower. My fiancé has a little mirror in the shower and I almost punched it when I saw my reflection. 

I’m to the point where I hate myself. I can’t lose weight because of my hormones I’m on from a hysterectomy in 2019. I’m not an obese person just slightly overweight. My sleep is being affected because of my anger turns depression. I’m too afraid to take sleeping meds because I already don’t hear my alarm clock in the mornings. I’m constantly stressed or mad about something. Those suicidal thoughts are coming back and it scares tf out of me. 

Now I’m mad I can’t fix me.

I keep hurting people everywhere I go ,"I'm too sensitive to it. I make a small joke like putting on those eclipse glasses and looking at my friend and saying ""I can't see you, you must not be very bright"". At the time I thought it was really funny, but I told somebody else that joke today and they didn't laugh. I asked my friend if she had thought it was funny and she said she did now, but that it had hurt her feelings a little in the moment. Learning that made me feel terrible. 

The other day I told my boss he looked weird in his shirt. I meant to say seeing him in a certain casual shirt was weird cause I'm so used to seeing him dressed as a boss. I felt bad and had to track him down later to apologize and he said he had actually thought it was funny and that he felt bad that I felt the need to apologize. Which made me feel worse like I'd made a situation that wasn't awkward into one that was. 

But the big giant thing is I just ended things with someone I really, really care about and deeply love. This man is really just the best. We were friends first. He's kind, he's loyal, he's funny, he's so generous, and I wanted our relationship to work but I just wasn't feeling it for whatever reason. I ended things as quickly as I realized, and he is taking it really hard. He's a beautiful soul and I never would want to hurt him and now I doubt he'll ever want to be my friend again. 

I just feel like I keep hurting peoples feelings, or if I didn't, I think myself into circles until I convince myself that I did. Or sometimes I REALLY hurt people. I killed a fly the other day and cried about it, because what right did I have to take it's life? But other people don't get so affected in this way. It's exhausting, I don't want to hurt anyone. Honestly. It genuinely makes me wish I was never born. I would so much rather be broken up with than be the person doing the breaking up, because at least in that instance I'm not carrying all this guilt. 

I was thinking of ending my life today and what I would write on the note. ""I don't want to hurt anyone anymore."" But how silly would that be? Because by taking my life, I would be hurting people who love me. And I know there are a few who do, I have a pretty good support system. I just am so tired. I'm so tired of being hurt and of hurting and I have been through a lot in my life and I just don't really want to do it anymore, honestly. But there's no out, I just have to go through it all. I don't mean to sound whiney but god I just really don't want to go through it all.  

I am trying to look at my life as something to cherish. I remember my 7th grade teacher used to congratulate us on our birthdays instead of saying happy birthday, and we all thought it was weird, but sometime near the end of the school year, when someone finally questioned her, she told us ""not everyone makes it to 13. Lots of people don't. You've made it this far, so congratulations!"" And I try to remember that. I'm 26 now (I probably sound a lot younger, sorry you had to read all my whining) and I can picture myself living a whole life, but on top of all the hurt and guilt I feel, there's a lot of anxiety about the state of the world and I don't even know what the future can look like.

I’m just tired,"I feel lost. I truly don’t know who I am anymore and feel like I got lost in my marriage, my fucked up childhood, amongst a buttload of trauma which, I mostly did to myself. I hate myself for that. I literally can’t tolerate people anymore in the slightest, I don’t see any positives in anything half the time. I’m tired of my husband telling me what to do when he does nothing and im tired of feeling unheard/treated like I have zero feelings.  I’m sick of living for everyone else and working my life away with no real career. I barely see my family and I don’t have any real friends or friends at all.

Feeling genuine anxiety and slight depression,"
Hey everyone,

I’m a 17M, and recently my parents got divorced and now my dad moved to another country and got remarried within months. Now every time I call him, if I ask for money for anything (cuz I barely make a couple hundred dollars a month at my part time job in high school), he gets upset and acts like I’m asking him a huge favor. Now I feel stressed out trying to cover all my own expenses other than rent, which my mom pays. I’m now living in a 2 bedroom apartment with my mom and my sister, and sleep on the couch every night. I’m getting stressed the hell out on expenses to how I’m gonna pay for college. It’s annoying to look at all my friends living a comfortable life while I’m out here trying to help with basic expenses. I know I might sound a bit bratty here, but am I wrong to feel this way?",Emotional-Mongoose85,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3mlvp/feeling_genuine_anxiety_and_slight_depression/
"I think I'm depressed, maybe I'm just lazy?","Hello. I'm 31 years old male from Puerto Rico, and still living with my mother. I wish this wasn't the case, but I don't have any money to buy my own house. I'm also obese at 5'8"" 280 pounds. At times I try to do exercise, but I find it extremely difficult and don't last long. Also, I tell myself that I'm going to start lifting weights, but I have zero motivation and have a hard time concentrating. I always feel like hot garbage, zero energy, sloppy. I've had some ancestors that had cancer, could it be a hereditary disease or something? I've lived a very sedentary life for 11 years.

I feel helpless, I can't sleep at night. I live in a house where they have a car repair shop. I'm willing to work there but constantly find myself distracted and don't do anything.

I wish I had a job that paid me the minimum wage at least, but I live in a somewhat rural area, lots of houses but not many commercial buildings. Everything is 30 minutes away and I don't have a car. I could use some money right now.

What can I do to improve my life? Are there any supplements out there that help with well-being? Maybe I have some type of deficiency that makes me feel like I'm depressed. Perhaps a chemical unbalance in the brain? When I try to sleep at night, I feel like someone is performing an exorcism on me and feel awful.

I know there are supplements out there that could help me, but I have no idea which. I ingest anti-depressants like Ativan, Restoril and Zyprexa. The only thing they do is aid with sleep somewhat.

There are lots of things I want, like a gaming computer and perhaps find a girlfriend, but women like men who are in shape and take care of themselves. I have a hard time brushing my teeth.

I'm convinced there's something wrong with me, but I don't know what it is. My school experience was terrible, I was bullied from middle school, then my parents got divorced right before I entered high school and moved 2 hours away. The last few years of school didn't get much better.

I want to live, be happy and feel good. I'd love to travel a little perhaps, although I'm not a huge fan of traveling, but most importantly, I want to achieve independence.

My dream is to play iRacing. I've always been big on video games, and always aspired to have iRacing since it was released, almost two decades ago. I find it hard to believe that I haven't yet played that game. I'm super scared to talk to people with fears that they're going to make fun of me.

What is wrong with me? I always tell myself, if others can do something, I can do it too.

When I was in high school, I fantasized about being a trans, started doing stupid things with my food, like overeating white rice so my glutes would get bigger. I also made my testicles drop so I could produce more estrogens to look like a woman. Could it be hormonal imbalance? My fapping doesn't feel good at all like it did in high school. I have man boobs as well and my orgasms are super weak. I think I have erectile dysfunction. I am uncircumcised. 

I almost had intercourse with a man in his 60's when I was in high school. Entered his house at least 10 times with intentions of doing it, but never actually did anything. Perhaps that scene gave me some mental trauma? He did touch me a few times, but I was scared and just left the house. I also gave my stepbrother head once when I was 15. Maybe I have a disease or something.

My father was pretty abusive when I was younger, I've always been told to respect older peers, he would sometimes hit me with belts when I did something bad in school. It was super scary; I was always scared of him.

I don't want to get in trouble, I just want to get to the bottom of my issue, assuming there is one. I just want to be happy. I really need to get in shape first if I want to find a woman willing to be with me.

I smoked weed in high school and had a panic attack. My memory of that situation is not very good. I'm not sure if I did something to trigger the panic attack. I may have started doing circles, which made me dizzy, but I'm not sure.

Any supplements or pills out there that could help my well-being? Multivitamins are not doing the trick.

I also experienced jock itch, which I thought was candida albicans. This jock itch thing lasted for more than a decade from 2011 to 2022. It has been gone for almost two years now, but I still may have something down there.

Spanish is my first language. I have family members in California that have decent income, but they don't want me there or even help me at all. My father lives there and I wish I could move with him but it's not his house.

I share all of these things with you to see if we can get to the bottom of my issues. Maybe it's medical or something insignificant or easy to fix, I don't know.",ItsJJ_PR,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3iddj/i_think_im_depressed_maybe_im_just_lazy/
My mind is on fire,"It's like I'm either totally wired in to what I'm doing, or I've checked out and don't know my own name.

Recently I've been wanting to play games with my friends but I just can't do anything besides sleep and work. Even if I sleep I'm so exhausted that I feel sick. Quite often my brain feels like it's on a race track, just endless thoughts spinning around. Other times it's quite and hollow like a cave. I'm pretty sure if someone knocked on my head they could gear the echo.

My mind is burning. It feels like I'm doing nothing right, nothing at all. Every thought I have spins around untill it's awful. I argue with myself outloud and it's always me telling myself to kill myself, then I reply for God knows what reason. Back and forth never conceding. Death is always on my mind, suicide is the thought right behind that.

I’m Lost (21 M),"I have been hurting for a long time, and I have the scars to prove it. I’ve never had the sense that I was enough for anyone. In the last 2 years, I’ve undergone serious surgery, my dog and my best friend have died, and my parents are up my ass about school and my life goals. 
I’m a college student at a very prestigious university; however, recently my grades have dropped significantly. This all started after I was raped. I called my best friend that night, and she immediately came to get me. I was at a party, got too drunk, and someone took advantage of that. About 6 months later, I was rushed to the hospital as I was dying from organ failure. I was stuck in the hospital for a significant amount of time, which meant I was missing school. My parents blamed me, and told me I should watch my health in the future to avoid missing school. The next semester my best friend died, so I took about a week off of school. I took this time off because I couldn’t sleep, eat, or function as a person during this time. My parents once again blamed me, and said I should just “man up” and get through the rest of the semester. 
The past 6 months have been filled with self-loathing and anger because of everything life has done to me. I have failed out of many of my classes, which has caused me to fall behind. I now have to take a ridiculous course load over the summer to make up for my performance over the last two semesters. Sometimes, I just feel like not being here anymore is the easiest solution. Who would care anymore because my best friend is already dead. I just can’t take the awful things that have been thrown my way anymore, and I have no way of dealing with them. My parents don’t believe in mental health and I have no way of paying for therapy. 
Additionally, I feel like I lose a little chunk of myself every day. I don’t feel like I’m the genuine and kind person I once was and that makes me so sad. I don’t know how to deal with any of this anymore, and I’m scared one day I’ll have had enough.",MeasurementPerfect46,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3pr6h/im_lost_21_m/

Please, to anybody who might be considering this... don't.  If you aren't successful, you could end up in a much worse position than you are already in. And if you are successful, the pain of losing another is... unbearable. At least that is what I have been told when I coded, and my time of death was announced... only for me to revive miraculously. 

Now, not only have I lost EVERYTHING in my life that is material, the majority of my loved ones do not ever wish to speak to me again and I can not move my legs... can't say that I blame them. Royally fucked up this time.

Vale realmente seguir intentándolo?,"Llevo años en este estado ,en dónde siento que no hago más que postergar el dolor , que vivir de efectos placebos que hacen que pueda digerir de alguna manera la vida. Me muestro tan fuerte y fría,pero por dentro soy tan sensible y me afecta mucho lo de mi alrededor. Ningún logro me hace sentir satisfecha, busco suplir ese vacío con pasatiempos, deporte y hobbies, que en el fondo no es más que mentirme a mi misma.Al final del día,solo siento que no encajo con nada ni nadie, siempre he sentido que no soy de este mundo, ni siento que mi cuerpo me identifica, me veo al espejo y no me siento yo, la dismorfia corporal me mata cada día,pero sigo con una sonrisa afrontando cada situación, sigo siendo la persona de contención para todos,sigo siendo dentro de mi,esa persona que aún busca sentirse a gusto y tiene esperanza. No pueden decir que no lo he intentado, he ido a terapia por años ,he sido medicada, me mantengo activa ,por sobre todo,me mantengo ocupada para no pensar.No me apetece compartir , he perdido muchas amistades y siento que en el fondo ,no me importa,que por alguna razón,no están. Siempre doy mi más sincero amor y cariño, y les juro que jamás espero tanto de vuelta.En parte morí cuando mi mascota murió hace unos años, no volví a ser yo, se llevó mi vida, y cada día me arrepiento de no haber estado ahí, cada día siento que me hace tanta falta.Me siento sola,pero lo peor es que cuento con personas cercanas y a pesar de eso,siento que nadie me comprende,que en cambio, me hacen sentir una persona complicada, alguien mal agradecido, con mal carácter. Siento que me estoy perdiendo nuevamente, siento que estoy apagandome cada vez más.Lamento tanto no poder mejorar , siento que hay algo mal conmigo, que siempre llego a esta instancia, en dónde no puedo amar bien, no puedo ser una buena hija, nieta, hermana o novia.Finalmente siempre hago daño, indirectamente, siempre lo arruino.",apathetik_k,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3l5r5/vale_realmente_seguir_intentándolo/

I’m so lost,"Probably nothing surprising here, but I really just need to have my thoughts out. If I end up killing myself soon, it may give some insight so it’s not just the “no one could have predicted this” BS. Everything is a mess. People keep asking me for updates on aspects of my life and I just have to lie and say things are fine. But they’re not. I have no fucking clue what’s going on. I’m behind on everything but I don’t have the energy to fix it. I’m just so tired all the time. I get enough sleep, but I’m still so exhausted constantly. I don’t have the energy to do the daily tasks most people seem to be capable of. I’ve gone to doctors and they say I’m healthy. But if I’m healthy, then why do I have to lie on the bakery floor partway through my shifts otherwise I’ll pass out? Thoughts of killing myself are happening more intensely now. Where as before I would just passively think about suicide, it’s now at the forefront of my mind and I’m this close to just doing it. I’m with my family stuck in a gas station parking lot for the night in the middle of nowhere right now. And I really want to just walk off into the desert. I don’t want anyone to find me. I don’t want them to have a funeral for me. I don’t want them looking at me and crying thinking what they could have done better like they did at my cousins funeral a few months ago. I just want to  be gone. Like I never existed. Since I can’t seem to do anything right. I used to be a straight A student, and now I’m failing all my classes because I can’t function like a normal human. My friends see me as the person they can turn to when they need help. The person who remembers birthdays. The person who will make them a home cooked meal. The person who will help them with homework. But they forget my birthday. They offer support, but never any actual support. I ask for help, and they forget… my partner is such a kind person but I just don’t love them anymore. And the thought of breaking their heart just makes my anxiety over life so much worse. 
There’s so much more but it’s probably nothing new here. 
I don’t know. I’m just sick of life like this. I think about the best case scenario and I just realize that life doesn’t have any meaning. There isn’t any point to continue existing.

Looking for some advice,"I have always denoncouned any labels to myself. Personally I find it limiting 
Yet sometimes calling something for what it is doesn’t help identity it.

Recently watched the Bridgerton queen series with my partner 
And this triggered me to acknowledging that I go through episodes of such lows and such highs.

As a young boy, I was such an over thinker. Alone most of my life, found comfort in myself and lived a lot in my own head.
Fast forward to being in my twenty’s
To combat that way of life, I simply didn’t think about what I was doing.
I just did it, with no thought of reprocussion.
This lead me into a dark path

Over the last 3 years I have found ways to get out of that way of life.
I mediate, write, gym, pray.

Yet living more open to feelings and what courses through me can sometimes undermine me.

There’s always this underlying sense of…emptiness and sadness.

I know if I think too much now that really, it hurts me.

How do others go about this?

To live and enjoy, to consciously embrace and reflect yet engage in life in a matter of “doing”?
To avoid this dread that lingers me.

When I was expelled from middle for making a threat for being bullied I was punished and for almost a year. Anything I said or did lead to more punishment.

My grandmother tried pushing me down the stairs calling me an ungrateful child. 

My mother has called me a burden and wished I was never born. 

When my step father hit me in the face she was mad at ME. 

I tried to kill myself when I was 17. Instead of my mom trying to figure out what was wrong she yelled at me. 

I've been suffering for so long and my family KNEW something was wrong with me. Instead of being proactive they just let it fester and now that it has gotten this bad they refuse to deal with me. 

What hurts is that NONE of them will tell me the truth. Even when I ask. They will tell me I'm over thinking only to literally talk shit about me for HOURS on in about how crazy I am about how sick I am. Forget all the bad shit they have ever done to me right. How do you cope when everyone you love hates you. How am I supposed to handle this.

am i depressed?,"so i don't really think i'm depressed. it's just like sadness bruh. 

i understand that this isn't like doctors diagnosis or anything, this is reddit for goodness sakes. i just wanna hear like public opinion 

so couple things:
a. i lost passion in things i used to love (reason being i'm not good enough)
b. too lazy/no motivation or drive to even try to get good at the things i say i'm not good enough at

1. i hate my friends all of a sudden. (Not all of a sudden it's been a gradual climb. it's just like all their little quirks just set me off. i can't handle their entire personality) 
i have been friends with them for a while so maybe i just grew out of them? 
2. i kinda am disliking my family. not my family, just my siblings. (i'm the youngest and all my siblings are highly accomplished so i have a big gap to fill in. i feel like i have no personality and only my older siblings exist. i just hate how i'm constantly compared to my siblings and have nothing that they can compare to. I DONT HATE MY SIBLINGS. i hate that i get compared to them)
maybe all normal siblings hate each other? also maybe it's an inferiority complex thing idk. 
3. i really just hate myself for being all these things. (I feel like i have no true reason to hate any of my friends or siblings. they all are great people but for some reason i can't handle them. I just don't understand why i hate them so violently. it just makes me feel like a disgusting shitty horrible person.)
is this depression or just like me being an unreasonably bad dude?

I don’t know what to do.,"Life just fucking sucks right now. And I need help, advice, comfort, anything honestly. 

To start, my mom was recently diagnosed with stage 4 ovarian cancer. That alone is rough to deal with. And shortly after that the love of my life left me. And shortly after that, my own aunt let me go from my job because they were downsizing. So now I’m dealing with the possibility of losing my mom, the worst heartbreak I can imagine, and unemployment. And after all this hit me I got a 6 figure job offer and thought maybe this is all apart of God’s plan and I’m about to receive a huge blessing. The job offer fell thru and now im unemployed and running out of money. So that’s what’s been going on in my life recently. 

I was with my ex when I found out my mom had cancer and she looked into my soul and told me “you will never have to worry about being alone ever again” and I bawled my eyes out in her arms. She left 2 weeks later. We had the most intimate, deep, and loving connection I thought anyone could have. We were best friends. I fully planned on marrying this girl. I had a ring picked out and everything. We also had promise rings if that adds any value tho this whole thing. I was living with my parents when we started dating, she lived an hour away. I drove 2 hours a day in bad big city traffic in a car that gets like 15 miles to the gallon for idek how many months. So I moved out of my parents house to be closer to her, that’s how serious I was. Pretty much all of my money went to her, whether that be random gifts, food, gas and other things. I know she didn’t ask for all that but I’m just saying that to let you know how serious I was. When we broke up she said she started having doubts early in the relationship, but she still led me on and drew me closer and closer. She would plan our future and promised so many things to me. I had trust issues from past relationships and other things in life and just as I was getting over those, she left me and told me that she knew it probably wasn’t going to work. I don’t think I will ever be able to trust someone again if I’m being honest. There’s more things I could say about her and more things I found out but I don’t want to waste any more of your time. 

Life is just beating the living fuck out of me right now and I’m tired of it. I fight the urge to kill myself everyday. Idk if I will or not. I’m just waiting to see if I’m gonna get more shit thrown at me or if something good will happen to me for once.

If you read all of this thank you. I hope this wasn’t a bore or a waste of your time. 

Edit: Another thing to add, the only reason I haven’t killed myself is because I’m scared to face God’s judgement. And I’m still scared so I probably won’t kill myself for that reason. Plus, I have some hope that I will be happy and at peace one day and I bet that’s gonna feel good so I’m not gonna give up and quit.

I am 13 and I have suicidal thoughts,"Hi, so I am a 13 year old boy who lives with my dad because my mom and dad got into lots of arguments and started living at seperate houses when I was 6. I am getting pressured by my father, who doesn't let me enjoy things, and only makes me study for a ""good future"". I keep getting bullied my older brother when I didn't even do anything, he forces me to watch gore since I was 10. He locks the door, then forces me to watch these stuff and when I say I don't want to I get beaten up. When I told this to my father he said ""that's discipline, grow up and learn how to be a man"".  I had lots of friends a few months ago and now all of them abandoned me.I was a happy boy who had good grades and friends and all of these things are gone and I am lonely. I don't know what gone wrong, I never changed. I get blamed for everything that goes wrong even though I have nothing to do with it. I don't want to have a boring life like this and enjoy my life rather than my father forcing me to do things I do not like. I am not saying making your son study is bad but you must let them enjoy their life and not force them to study 24/7 and yell at them when they use their phone or computer.

I’ve been hit with severe depression after my girl friend of 2 years left,"Yeah. So my girlfriend if two years left me(25m). She had a point which isn’t wrong. I made a huge mistake that broke her. Thought we could work on it together but one day she decided that she can’t see her future with me and decided to leave.

I tried talking to friends but none of them were of any help. They just hang up on me and say that they’ll call later but never do. I posted my story on reddit asking for an advice but instead I got hatred for what I did and everyone said that I deserve it. Yes I was an a-hole for doing things that broke her. But I’m a changed man now. I deserve the pain. Like people said, I should leave her alone. But I can’t. I have dreamt of a future with her. I can’t take the fact that it is destroyed now. All I want is her and herself only.

I’ve never been good in anything. My family has a loan on my studies. I couldn’t secure a job to clear that loan. I’ve been in three relationships till now. Everyone just abandoned me when I wanted them the most. Tried antidepressants, rubber band therapy but none of them are working either. I’m just tired. I’m broke physically, mentally and financially. Sometimes I just wanna kill myself. But the loan is stopping me. I can’t put that on my family and just leave. But I can’t live like this either. I’m tied in the darkness unable to come out.

17m ,"I have an older brother about 12 years older than me and up till I was 15 would constantly hit me if i were to do anything that upset or annoyed him. I would be 5 and anything i did to upset would result in me getting hit on the ground and punched all over. He would sometimes hit my older sister whos 4 years older but never like me since im a boy. I remember being small and tiny and crying after, it really hurt. I think he learned it from my dad since he would hit me and my sister too, but again it was much harsher on me and when my sister and I would go to visit and would tell our mom and she would get on his ass about how excessive he was. I remember when he hit my 4 year old half sister for walking in the parking lot when we were supposed to get in the car, she was just a baby. His mom is also like that, she would favor my sister and buy her food and clothes and id just have to tag along since she couldn’t leave me home, she always wanted a daughter but never had one. One time she hit cause i jumped over the couch cause I didnt want to get infront of the tv to intercut her show and she got a belt and whooped me for 2 minutes, my sister came to me after when i was crying and called my mom to pick us up. I dont go to visit often since then and have never stayed for more than a week since. Most of the time my brother would hit me i wouldnt tell my mom since nth would happen and he would just b mad. It didnt stop until i had the intention to kill him and tried stabbing him which he beat me down and told my mom and he stopped after.

 I tried talking to my mom about it but she just says its normal brother stuff and how her younger brother would fight with her, its not the same at all. They dont know whats it like to be that little and skinny and the way it hurts and crying cause all you wanted was to have fun but they wanted to punish me. She said im just supposed to move past it but those people arent my family, ive never felt loved by them only tolerated. I dont like them at all and they just think im a pussy. I dont think im overreacting, this isnt normal right. All my mom has to say is she tried her best as a single mother and thats it and she’s sorry i feel this way. It wasnt just the hitting, the verbal abuse of being reminded how ugly i was made really insecure about myself, i didnt do well in school and would get called things but it would always be “jokes”. Kids would laugh and say things about my skin, then id have to go home and hear the same thing. Im moreno and my family would just say things just reinforcing how lesser than human I really am. The german word is untermensch, thats what i am in their subconscious, thats what i appear as to everyone 

I think about killing myself alot and cry sometimes and my mom came in my room asking what was wrong in december, i told her to leave me alone and she wouldn’t get out so I pushed her out, not hard just pushed i made sure not to press her hard. My brother came in the room saying if i ever put my hands on her again he’d fuck me up. He still thinks about doing it, it made me want to end my life more and the only reason i havent done it is cause i dont have a gun, i dont know what to do. I have a 3.95 gpa since i try to do my work right at school since their isnt anything else to do. I dont think i like these people, i dont think whatever they do for me I can just move past it. I dont like these people and i have to vent on reddit since im not close to anyone and dont talk to anyone daily, its just me and my now ps5 thanks to my stepdad. I dont think i mind it but i feel alone, i feel like no matter what i do it doesnt matter.

On antidepressants since 2021 but nothing has changed,"My psychiatrist told me I was probably born depressed, meaning I have the tendency to feel this way and it’s true that i’ve been feeling depressed for most of my life.

Crazy? ," Crazy-? 

 I’ve been an outcast my entire life. In my family, with friends, school, anywhere I go it feels like I’m pinned against a wall. They look at me as if I’m not human- my mom said she could tell someone I’m special needs and they wouldn’t question it, she has to understand that’s hurtful right?

Growing up I was outgoing and loud, in my family I was categorized with my cousin, we were “the weird kids”, my cousins would make fun of him when he wasn’t around and I know they did the same with me. They have called me childish for as long as I can remember, but obviously I was childish I was a fucking child. As I grew up I got quieter, anxious and terrified of disappointing people. I had some not so great relationships and friendships that made me feel crazy. I was 12 when these things started happening, dated someone that was not good for me to say the least. Started hurting myself in 7th grade because of them, broke up after almost  5 months and I spent the next 2 years yearning for their attention, for them to love me the way I loved them. They used me to take out all there anger, they were so nice when we met, an amazing friend but as soon as we dated they became hurtful and cold. Treated everyone around me kindly and me like total shit. A couple months after we broke up I got close to him, a person I can’t bare to see. He laughs and makes gag noises when he sees me as if I was the problem- he lied to me through our entire relationship, made up people and story’s. Told me that he had certain things in his closet, hurtful things- said his dad hit him and even made up 3 fake friends to trick me into things. I knew he was lying I’m not an idiot but I “loved” him. We were on and off for months and I honestly can’t remember all the horrible things he made me do because they are so far repressed into my mind. I remember one night in particular tho, I wish I could forget it- I was at his house and we were hanging out having a good time, he went to the kitchen and grabbed a knife and told me he wanted to “try something” he gave me the knife and took off his shorts and told me to cut him. he said that he was into it and when I said I didn’t want to he said I didn’t love him. He claimed I had been lying to him and if i loved him id do it, so I took the knife and did what he said-  to make it even worse this little girl from across the street was there, he had her sit in the closet before it happened. she was 9, a fucking 9 year old. he's the one that made my self harm even worse, he made me start vaping, drinking, made me do things- he used to claim that he couldn't kiss me because of his braces which obviously I knew was a lie but I was to scared to ask him why he really wouldn't kiss me- ofc now i know its because he never actually loved me. one of the last nights i was at his house was the worst tho, he had made me do so many things before that night and i knew what was next. I had never had sex with anyone before, people talk about how there first time was special or amazing but mine was horrible- so horrible i barley remember it, he didn't want to touch me he only wanted me to touch him as he had the entire relationship. I didn't want to but I did because I thought he'd fall in love with me somehow. after that night we broke up completely and haven't talked since. No one knows about the things that happened with him, no one cares- we only broke up because the first abusive partner texted me, they said they loved me and wanted to be with me so I ended it with him. A week or two later they decided they hated me again, them along with my other “friend” texted me they hated me that new years along with a lot of other messages about how horrible I was, and both blocked me. A month later the other friend reached out and we began talking again, then my ex also reach out and everything was “fine” I started dating this person during that time, they were sweet but also not and our relationship didn’t last long because that February my ex texted me again. They came over and we had a night that we called “long hug night” we sat in my room and hugged for hours not saying anything, we were high and crying and we felt close. They said they wanted to kiss me but since I was dating someone I told them it couldn’t happen. A week later on April fools night I broke up with my boyfriend to be with them and a week after that they got cold again- we stopped talking after I yelled at them for doing that again and a month later I found out they were dating my friend. During all of this the ex-friend that joined my ex in hating on me for new years had gotten rather close to me, I found out they liked me and one Wednesday at a friends house we kissed. The next week he came over and we had a great time, at one point we kissed again and made out which from my knowledge was completely ok because he didn’t tell me he didn’t want to and we had kissed the week before. 3 days later I found out he told a bunch of our friends that I sexually assaulted him. Everyone was against me and I lost almost all of my friends over a lie- I have been SA and I would never do that to someone else. Back to the girl and my ex though, I only found out they were together because they broke up and after they did I felt bad for my friend and asked if she wanted to see a movie with me to cheer her up, we got close and started dating and I bet you know we’re this leads. She claimed to be a “lesbian” but since I am trans and identify as a male she wasn’t one, she got mad at me for mentioning top surgery and continued to say she was lesbian while dating a trans man. After a bit I lost connection because of this and I broke up with her and 2 months later on October 1st to 6th my sister got in a car accident and died. She was 16, and I was 14. I couldn’t believe it- ofc during this that ex-friend that cost me nearly all of my friends showed up again, he apologized for the things he said and told people and wanted to be friends again. Since we had mutual friends we got closer and I thought it was behind us until he got cold months later and screamed at me. During the October my sister died I got close to this girl, scarlet, she was kind and sweet and she dressed up as Garfield for Halloween. That December we kissed while watching tinkerbell and started dating January 15th 2023. I have nothing bad to say about her because it’s currently july 14th 2024 and our year and a half is tomorrow. I love her more than worlds can describe. 

But even with the girl I want to marry someday I still feel crazy. I hate myself more than I thought possible and everyday is weighing on me. Although to everyone else around me it looks like nothings happening I’m crumbling. Struggling to wake up each morning and not scream at myself. I have diagnosed ADHD and anxiety along with so many other issues that are tearing me apart. My girlfriend thinks I have an eating disorder, people I’ve talk to think I have autism or am bipolar, and everyone else thinks I’m crazy. I’m 16 man- I’m just a kid. All I can think about is how badly I hate everything I do. I have no dreams, no future plans, no hope. I’m terrified of driving, I don’t have a job, I have nothing. It feels like everyone hates me, and if they don’t now they will. I can’t stop hurting myself or getting high or eating to much or starving myself. I know change starts with me and no one else can fix this but I don’t know how to. I’m a fat, ugly, tranny that my parents don’t even want. They want their little girl but she died a long time ago and if they’re not careful they’ll lose their boy too. I’m this close to ending it all, I can’t keep living like this. I’m tired of carrying this burden, I’m tired of being such a burden to people that I love. I can’t stop being terrible, it feels like that’s all I’ve ever been. Like I deserve everything that’s happened to me- I’m suicidal, homicidal, and I need real help that I can’t get. I wish for something horrible to happen to me because just maybe they’ll care and realize I wasn’t fucking playing around. I’m serious and I’ve always been serious- maybe I am crazy  ",Constantly_thinking1,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3lq5e/crazy/
Debating on whether I should go to inpatient ,"I went to inpatient in 2022 and have been suffering still. I’ve gone to therapy, have taken meds and got back on track to have a more “normal” life with a job and stuff. I’ve gained a few friends as well. But on the inside I’m absolutely rotting. Nothing seems to be giving me that extra lift to actually feel normal. 

Inpatient didn’t help long term but it stopped me from killing myself. I’m hesitant, firstly because my suicidal thoughts come in waves, and secondly because I have narcissistic parents who would be absolutely livid if I went back. My health insurance wouldn’t cover the cost and I’d likely be left with thousands of dollars of debt.

I continuously upset my boyfriend because I don’t know how to express what exactly it is I’m feeling.. but how do I look at him and say I’ve harmed myself for the past weekend after being clean for two-three years and that vivid images of harming or killing myself are on a constant replay within my mind?

I just hate so much abt me, the fact that I can't eat the portions of food my family want me too because I feel full way before I finish it all, the fact I even am going to a school anymore, my significantly increased emotional instability due to test concentration, and my ADHD and Autism maybe also giving a role as to why I have MASSIVE separation anxiety disorder and am Developing BPD.

Tired of this.,"I’m 42m and I’m tired of life. I’ve been depressed since I was 21 and am now bipolar. No wife girlfriend kids or friends to speak of. I’m a loser living in my moms basement. I’ve tried everything to get better but I can’t. ECT, medication, counseling, social worker, exercise, sunlight, diet, taking care of my dog nothing works. I am trying to get on disability because I can’t work cause of this. Everyone that has been in my life got what they wanted out of me then moved on. The whole world and everyone in it has passed me by. I quit alcohol and weed and that has just made things worse with my mental health. I have lashed out at people who left me and have guilt and shame because of it. I try to love myself because I know that’s the key but I just can’t. My brain is diseased and anything I do to help myself is just a temporary distraction and my bipolar is ALWAYS there to take over. I can’t do this much longer. Nothing but loneliness pain and misery ahead for me. I feel so bad for my chihuahua Teddy. 😞😞😞😔😔",Full_Grand_8450,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3dq6l/tired_of_this/
contemplating suicide ,"I’m tired of fighting and just want to die. I am the problem so it would be easier if I just don’t exist anymore. I am completely alone, never happy, I make things worse, I hate who I am, etc. I’m in therapy, take medication, try to find hobbies, but nonetheless the result is all the same. I keep getting worse and worse. If I was born with such issues then I don’t understand why I had to be born. I wish I had the courage to end my life.

It does not always get better,"I see the comment “it gets better” so many times as a response. Are yall time travelers? Because help me understand where this notion is being pulled out of. It is a cliche phrase I’ve heard since I was first diagnosed with depression at 15 and suicidal at 21. I am now 31 and for all intents and purposes it has absolutely the fuck NOT gotten better. I really think it does for some but medication turns me into a zombie that is neutral to everything. If this is what’s called getting better I effectively died at 21 anyways because I’m living life like a vapid robot working and slaving away in a failing society- multiple things that are spiraling out of control in todays world (H5N1, political unrest locally and globally, financial collapse and inflation, deteriorating job market, “enshittification”, microplastics, ADHD and social media driven society)- and the list goes on.

Exhausted. Need Advice.,"Hello.

I am a 31 year old female. All of my life I have suffered from severe inattentive ADHD and depression.  Victim of a narcissistic toxic family, labeled the black sheep. FF to my adult life. Survivor of domestic violence, then later unrelated a violent rape. 2 years ago now almost 3 I lost custody of my son. He is 9 now.  I see him every Wednesday, Friday, and every other Saturday. The coparent is a narcissist who is extremely controlling and if it is not their way its no ones way. Always in the public eye, the one with the most money, never follows the order, constantly filling my child's head with manipulative bullshit. When its good its great but it always fleeting always temporary.     Over the past 9 years so many times I  have thought about finality.    I won't elaborate on that I think most of you can understand it.   

  
I want to change. I am so tired of living life this way. I am constantly physical exhausted, agitated, or just ready to give up.  The only time I feel any shred of happiness is when I am with my son or get to hear his voice on the phone. He is the only thing that keeps me going.   I am a first responder.  I am in RN school.   I start in August.   I want to get on a medication to help with my ADHD so that I can focus but also a medication that will help with my depression giving me energy, purpose and drive to get up and DO things throughout the day. On top of everything I severe anxiety.   I have tried so many different medications and want to know if anyone has any recommendations.   I am well aware that everyone is different and everyone responds differently.  I am going to respectfully ask the reddit community to not comment things like ""You need to talk to your doctor"" or ""Everyone responds to medication differently"".  I want to know what works for you.   I am going to list the medications that I have tried here and the side effects that I have had: 

Strattera-Currently on it. Not giving up just yet. Seriously bad anxiety. 40mg

Vyvanse: 20mg love it until it starts to wear off. Hype focusing. Make just get back on it.

Lexapro: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Trileptal: Serious weight gain, lethargy

Prozac: Giddy, would laugh inappropriately which happens to me a lot on antidepressants. 

Zoloft: Giddy, would laugh inappropriately. (This is for the first 2 weeks of most antidepressants with me. Its embarrassing and I work in direct patient care. I cannot be like this at work period.

Effexor XR: Very bad depression and a serious almost police involved attempt.

Trintellix: Bitchy and agitated

Cymbalta or Duloxetine: Serious anxiety for the first month of taking to the point where I had to get off.

Citalopram: Have been on it. Don't really remember it but I think anxiety.

Bupropion or Wellbutrin XR:  Bitchy and lightheaded. Did not really give it the best trial run. 

Lamictal: So aggressive and agitated that a trip to the ER and handcuffed to a chair

Geodon: Made me fall asleep in my food

Latuda: Craved sweets constantly 

Abilify: Made me slur my speech, crave sweets, felt sedated

Depakote: Made me slur my speech, rock back and forth, agitated

Topamax: Made extremely anxious, forget where I was going in traffic and literally how to drive

Caplyta: Crave sweets, weird dreams, crying spells

Clonazepam(Klonopin) Currently take PRN

Ativan: Serious memory issues.

Xanax: Depression.

Buspirone: Very bad headache did not manage anxiety effectively

Vistaril: Laughable did absolutely noting for my anxiety. Made my nose extremely dry. 

Those are all of the ones that I remember taking.  I need recommendations based purely on what has worked for others on antidepressants and ADHD medication. Thank you!",Icy-Turnip-9679,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3ggfu/exhausted_need_advice/
Tricyclics and also quelling musculoskeletal aches?,"I somehow became interested if there were levels of free-floating sadness/gloom even more severe than depression/dysthymia, and came upon melancholia. While it doesn’t look like I match enough symptoms, I did note with interest on one page that it’s very frequently comorbid with musculoskeletal aches/pains.

I immediately thought of my own teleporting minor aches (i.e. on the 1-10 pain scale, they’re generally 1, or even 0.5). I’d even tried bupropion briefly because of them (bupropion apparently also helps with fibromyalgia, and I figured it might be worthwhile to try it even if this were better called *pseudo*fibromyalgia, in case the underlying causes were different but not the ending nature of the aches), but quickly decided it dried out my mouth too much to endure. Next noticed thing: Melancholia usually gets treated with tricyclics, not SSRIs or SNRIs.

Tenuous-looking, but after sertraline and escitalopram losing strength and my being unsure about my current fluoxetine, I wonder if a tricyclic could quell *both* my gloom and the pseudofibro…(I forget why I ultimately decided it wasn’t actually fibromyalgia -_- )",SkyknightXi,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3kn6v/tricyclics_and_also_quelling_musculoskeletal_aches/
"I'm trying to find a reason to live, and i'm not finding it","Let's start saying i (M15) don't want to kill myself, neither self harm (unless you count aggressively biting my nails :P).
I feel like i move by pure inertia. I waited a lot of time dreaming of having friends and hanging out with them, but now that i have really good friends, i feel too tired to hang out with them most of the times.
My life is pretty simple. I wake up, i go to school (not for now lol), i come home, i play videogames, i have dinner, i play videogames, i go to sleep. Every day. I've tried lots of sports and hobbies, but still i didn't find a passion, and I'm starting to lose hope in finding it.
And the fact is... That i both like and hate my life. I know i'm wasting my life saying at home doing nothing, but i never have the energies to get out of this trashy routine. if i start something, it's because it happens, in a way or another. 

I just broke up with my gf because she was basically flirting with her friends and she gave me very little attention compared to how much i cared about her, and now i'm sure i can't be loved anymore. No one will ever love me as i do. And everytime someone comforts me saying ""you'll find someone"", i thank them but deep down i know it's a lie said to make me happy.
If i rationally listed all the reasons to not kms (i repeat: i have 0 intention of doing so), i'd probably find out that they are way less than before.
I see being depressed as a goal now.

School anxiety and depression ,"Hi, I’m a 23(F) University student who has been struggling with diagnosed anxiety and depression for 9 years (7 years diagnosed). 
I get extremely anxious whenever I think about studying, am studying or when I know that I have to go back to uni soon. I haven’t been able to sleep well, so I often wake up depressed. It’s not that I have trouble falling asleep but I get depressing dreams or nightmares. Everytime anything related to my course or university pops up whether it’s an advertisement, part of a TV series, movie or I overhear conversations, I get rly anxious. 

I dropped out of my first course in 2021, took a gap year, started a new 1 year course in 2022 (graduated), basically took another year off due to inevitable placement delays, and is heading into my 2nd semester of first year doing an undergrad in psychological studies.

I’ve been crying almost everyday and been trying to get my mind off things, but I still struggle a lot. Tbh, I have thought about seeing a psychologist again but just the thought of making appointments and finding time to actually talk already gives me anxiety. 
I’m already working PT and studying. 

Ik that probably focusing on studying is more important, but in this economy.. I can’t rly afford to quit my job bc I need it to pay for rent and for other expenses. 

I have no motivation for anything.. I constantly feel stressed and have negative suicidal thoughts however, Ik that I will never actually do it due to fear of pain. I want to leave this place so bad but I’m terrified of doing it. 

I used to have a career goal but university has been me change my mind twice, so now I feel stuck.. 

Atp, I’m just trying to get a degree for the sake  of my family so that they could back off a little bit when it comes to my life.

i have been struggling to just exist the past weeks but no one in my life gets it ,"I’ve barely managed the bare minimum. I have skipped all my classes, i have not studied once even tho exams are coming up, i haven’t met any friends in about 2 months. For the past 3-4 weeks, i have done nothing except for lay in bed the entire day, curtains closed, sleep, eat and rot and stare at my phone. Barely managed to shower, brush my teeth and brush my hair. Most days didn’t even change out of my sweatspants. Only left the house to buy food and go to therapy (at least that was still possible). But no one in my life gets it. I don’t even tell my parents because they get angry quickly and blame me for not getting off my ass. I tried opening up to someone from uni who asked why i wasn’t attending anymore. But when i told him i wasn’t feeling good and barely make it out of bed everyday he was like „lol why are YOU exhausted you don’t even come to class“ and i was like yeah no shit that’s the issue.

Emotional abuse ,"Get yelled at most days:

consuming stories makes me want to unalive myself,"I'm getting more and more confused as to how people can get out of watching any kind of light-hearted series and not be consumed by this giant void of shame, emptiness and nostalgia for something you never had. 

I've never got to experience being popular, or average, or being in a little outcast gang, or being part of a cool band. I was just alone all the time. too anxious for sports or anything p.e. related. I've never walked to any friends house, never got invited to any party. I live in this boring prison of a house in this boring neighborhood. I live in Brazil thus the schools aren't nearly as interesting as the stuff I see in North America or any other more developed part of the world, and the streets just aren't safe or spacious and green. literally makes me wish I lived in a cul-de-sac. the few friends I ""have"" have much more interesting lives and other things to pay attention to, so we hang out like once or twice a year. I'm just to tired of my life being inside a screen.

when I read these stories of people going through things *together*, or having difficult lives but a couple of friends or siblings to talk to or to casually hang out with, I just get so emotionally involved with them, their lives seem so normal, it's comforting and depressing at the same time, because it's just fiction, it's not really there, they're not my friends, I can't interact with them. and when I finish the story after growing so attached to the characters I just have this moment that I want to cry on the pillow for like half an hour. sorry if this is too uncomfortable to know but I feel so much like shit that I literally don't feel like doing that private thing teens usually do. I literally can't do something so normal because I'm feeling too shit. and then thoughts of self harm flow through my head. it's been like this for years and idk I just think that this shouldn't be normal for a teenager, I don't deserve this, I really don't think I do.",vitu9087,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e39rnd/consuming_stories_makes_me_want_to_unalive_myself/

I’m stuck and I can’t do this anymore,"Honestly I felt so stupid and dramatic writing all this but I’ll post it anyway because idc anymore. 

I’ve been depressed and feeling suicidal for about 3 months now but things have gotten majorly worse in the past couple weeks. I don’t know how I make it through every day, I’m so bored and there’s nothing I enjoy anymore. The only reason I’ve made it until now is my family and my dog. However my family are going on holiday without me in 2 days. This is like the 5th time they’ve done it because I have severe anxiety and I can’t go with them. This time though, I REALLY need them. I’ve tried expressing what I’m feeling and had the help of my mental health worker too but they’re going anyway. My MH worker thinks they should go too and I’ll cope better than I think I will. I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they’re the only thing keeping me going. And while they’re away my dog is going to the kennels because I can’t even look after her by myself. 

I’ve expressed these thoughts mostly to my MH worker who has relayed them to my family but my family don’t understand why I can’t tell them these things myself. I’ve told them it’s very difficult. I’ve expressed the fact I want to die to all of them (MH worker and family) and I felt like they under reacted. Maybe they think I’m being dramatic and I wouldn’t actually do anything, which was true up until now but now I’m in such an awful place I don’t trust myself not to try to hurt myself or kms. Tonight I self harmed for the first time. I didn’t do much and am too much of a wimp to be honest but I had an urge to do it.

Anyway I feel like if I tell my parents, everything will blow up. They get so stressed out about me and I know they need a break but I can’t survive that right now. I honestly feel so stuck. Dying seems like the only way out. 

I’ve also had intrusive thoughts about hurting other people. Like I said, I don’t trust myself. I would never do anything like that in my right mind but clearly I’m not in my right mind right now and I’m worried I’ll go crazy and snap. I genuinely don’t know what to do. If I don’t let my family go I feel like they’ll resent me. But it’s not like there’s even any way I can make them not go. So therefore suicide seems like the only way out. But nobody believes I would do that. I’m so stuck. ",imaginaryability41,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3hhwp/im_stuck_and_i_cant_do_this_anymore/
I’m going to unalive myself on August 1st,"I’ve been battling depression for most of my life, everyone has told me it’ll get better. I used to have hope but I no longer have hope for the future as I get older. I don’t care that I’m young (22) I don’t want to live in this society that we’ve created. Everything is so unbelievably depressing. Work, home, repeat. Everything is so expensive, why am I going to waste my life working at a job I hate when I won’t even have time or the money to afford housing or groceries or retirement. It’s hard making friends as an adult and I don’t have any now, I don’t think I ever will. I tried going the spiritual route by thinking I have a define purpose in this life but I can’t see how that’s possible when there’s 8 billion people on planet. I think we were just put here to suffer and I’ve done that enough. I’ve travelled, I’ve moved to different cities, I’ve moved back to my hometown to be closer to family, I’ve laughed and I’ve cried and cried and cried. I am so tired of my unhappiness, I know it’s so bad I’m affecting other people. When I was at work the other day a customer asked me why I looked so sad and I just shrugged it off. I’ve been to copious amounts of therapy and from that I’ve learned that I am the master of my own universe and I am the one that has to put in the work to be better and make my life better. But I have no desire to, I don’t see the point. All of this is meaningless and monotonous. My family will be sad and it pains me to know that, I wish I could just vanish without causing them pain. But life goes on and eventually they will learn to live without me. If they can’t they inevitably will die too and in 100 years no one will remember me or my loved ones since life goes on. I don’t even know why I’m posting this to be honest, I don’t want to be talked out of it.

The cycle isn’t talked about enough,"Hi all,

Pretty much done with life rn. One thing people often mention, but I do not think emphasize enough, is how badly depression feeds into itself. 

I went all in on my last relationship of 3.5 years. I got depressed like 8 months in (not her fault) and slowly kept burning all kinds of bridges around me. 

When she decided her bridge was no longer meant for me, I realized I am a completely solitary island now. 

Was I fine with it for awhile? Yea. Do I still feel safe when I’m alone? Yea. But anyone who’s been here will tell you deep down they wish they had a support system but it’s so difficult to start from scratch. 

It’s wild how easily I made friends when I *already had* tons of friends. same with women. 

So now, yea, in a couple quick years I went from having a dreamy life to having no people on Earth who care about them. The physical toll has shown too, as I’ve lost about 30-35 lbs (already skinny). 

Really really don’t know where to go. I’ve tried reaching out to old friends, it’s mostly unsuccessful and quite soul crushing. Any advice? I fantasize about the big end every night rn.",PlasticHot7188,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3hdnb/the_cycle_isnt_talked_about_enough/
"31m, do I even have a chance at life anymore","I've really been trying fix my life

I've made so many mistakes and at times I feel like I'm not good at anything.

I wasn't good in school

I tried going into the military. To get college money, try to get motivated into being a better person, get into better shape, and have time to figure out what I wanna do in life.

Reality wise, I wasn't good at it, was even more depressed and fell into a cycle of barely passing my fitness while also getting more demotivated and still had no idea what I wanted out of life.

So after 4 years I knew I wasn't a good fit for this role and would have eventually been kicked out so I wanted get out, get a regular paying security guard gig as a temporary thing to do something easy while I figure things out.

fast forward 6 years later, mediocre pay with a crappy job and I'm not any closer to figuring out my life than I was at 18 when it was time to get a job and try to make something of my life.

So I asked my dad for some advice. He gave me a couple ideas, one leading into HVAC technician.

Seemed like something I could get into.

I used my GI bill, went to school, got training and everything seemed great. Then I tried applying to jobs but no one would hire me

Got a job at Circle K maintenance, cause they made it seem like they needed people with experience in plumbing, electrician, and HVAC. But reality wise I'm not doing anything HVAC related (they keep telling me they wanna do that eventually but I don't know if eventually is 5 months or 5 years)

So after 6 months of being a glorified janitor, I try applying for other jobs again

Got an interview for an actual HVAC company only to find out how little I actually know of the field and how much competition there actually is.

Its gotten to the point where any choice I make I feel like I'll never make something of myself, I feel like no matter what I do I keep fucking up and keep failing

I feel like no matter how many times I try to climb out of this hole, the hole just keeps getting deeper and deeper and I just keeping slipping to the bottom.

And what if I get into the HVAC industry and I'm not even good at it, like how I'm not good at anything.

what is wrong with me? [rant],"I haven't really told or opened up like this to anyone but after seeing people open up on here and the support, I thought I could try as well. 

I'm \[19F\] currently starting my second sem of uni and honestly...its not going how I planned at all. I failed three courses, am eating horribly and generally not feeling like myself anymore to the point where I don't even want to eat, drink or do anything cuz it makes me sick to my stomach at the fact that I...am alive? idk how to describe it. My moods constantly change so fast it's like getting whiplash, I can't face my peers without being revolted in myself and honestly...im so tired of feeling like this. My family are disappointed in my behaviour and my friends try to help but it's just them being like 'don't take it too seriously' or 'oh no, you're fine'. I can't listen to music or find any entertainment anymore cuz this stress is just eating at my brain like a damn parasite and I absolutely hate it.

I tried searching up these things online everything says I might have depression or anxiety but I guess in my mind I don't want to accept that cuz if I do the reality of it all sinks in. In my culture it's kinda taboo talking about mental health and stuff so my family tries to help but it's mostly just 'people have it worse than you', 'stop being dramatic', and the classic 'it's your phone that's the problem'. Part of me knows they are right but it doesn't really help. Im still 19 and can't secure a job, not very open and social and now I have to worry about some immigration issues or else my whole family could risk getting deported. 

Basically, my dad has been trying to secure a stable resident status abroad for almost a decade now and failed. And since we are considered immigrants here, we've been living as international people the whole time- despite living here for 10 years by 2025. It's honestly drained our whole family to the point where we haven't even gone out to a restaurant to eat or enjoyed life for so long. My parents fight constantly and I have to put everything aside to mediate them and be the therapist for everyone since I was 10. But now that I'm considered an adult and have finished primary and high school here, I have a chance at changing it all and gaining residency for my family. 

Naturally, I'm ecstatic that I can finally do something about this situation but with everything else, I'm so scared that I'll screw this up too. My dad says I should take a gap year and secure this, since the process might take about three years but I'm already enrolled and have started 2nd year of uni. I've been trying to find the course I need to do while juggling uni but the intakes available are only in Jan 2025 and it makes me even more hopeless cuz by then I'll already be 20, while my friends are all way ahead of me and thriving. I honestly just feel stuck in my life and even after I tried to stay positive and not take things too seriously, it still weighs me down so much mentally and emotionally.

Life atm,"23 years old. Obese (BMI 34.7). 
Work in healthcare. 
No friends (not a single one). 
Work in a relatively toxic environment (boss isn’t nicest person in the world, staff are equally as cliquey and regularly insult/make fun off people when they’re not on)

I can absolutely see myself being single until the literal day I die. Every single day off for me is spent alone, eating or sleeping. That’s literally it. My idea of a day out is going out myself to get food and that’s literally it. 

I’ve realized recently that not only am I very overweight, I’m also very ugly/unattractive. And this is absolutely not me feeling sorry for myself. I’ve a massive double chin, a round circle face, bumpy/slanty/weird nose, weird yellow uneven teeth etc. I could go on. 
At least when I was skinny I had that to hide my attractiveness, but now there’s absolutely no hiding it. 

I don’t get told about family gossip. I have my weight pointed out regularly. I have my lack of a social life pointed out regularly. I’ve only recently started getting praised at my job/told I’m doing well. That’s it. That’s the one and only thing I’ve got going for me. No friends. No boyfriend or girlfriend.

I have no joy in my life.,"For the past 5 years of my life, I feel like there’s a pit of sadness that doesn’t go away. I may feel momentary joy, but that quickly turns into stress and anxiety. There isn’t a single part of my life that I can consider happy. I feel like an outcast within my own “friends” some of whom barely bother listening to what goes on in my mind. I even feel like an outcast within my own family. They see me as someone who’s just lazy, always asleep, or always in a bad mood. For years I didn’t bother telling people what was wrong until recently. That only made it worse. Talking to my sister and my parents I realized this feeling is never going away because even they seem to try to understand nor care about the pressing feeling in my chest. I’ve thought about taking my own life before, but I always knew that I’d never do it. As time has gone on, the thought becomes less and less terrifying. Knowing that this is what the rest of my life will be like makes me fear that one day the feeling will grow so strong that I just off myself. What’s there to stop me? I know that the pain of losing a loved one goes away, and someone like me taking their own life would be an incredibly easy loss to swallow. I feel burdened with my own existence. I don’t see my life ever becoming something worth living. Maybe leaving this will help, maybe it won’t, but it feels like every passing day of my life brings me closer to my last.

I saved a friend from commiting suicide.,"I work for a toxic environment job and my friend was highly affected by it, this happened couple of hours ago and it was our lunch break, my friend was silent the whole duration of it, 5 minutes left and I'm smoking a cigarette my friend asked me what will happen If I jump from the roof (which is where we have lunch) I sarcastically said nothing they'll never care, he disappeared for a minute out of my sight and I caught him with the side of my eye placing a chair and looking down the street beneath, I immediately ran over to tackle him before he do it, as much as I'm grateful for that cigarette that I lit up that left me on our lunch area, as much as I'm feeling I wasn't that much of a good friend as I took it sarcastically, I got an early leave off of work and sitting alone in my room having those suicidal tendencies myself, struggling to keep it because I suffer from depression also, I think that incident triggered something in me don't know what it is.",Angel5006,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2m2by/i_saved_a_friend_from_commiting_suicide/

I hate being alone, I hate my own company. I'm too depressed to find joy in hobbies or even mindlessly watching TV etc. I have chronic pain among other progressive health conditions and life is at one of its peaks of hell lately. I'm in so much pain 24/7 with no distraction. I can't leave the house or work due to my health. I've been suicidal for years but I stay alive for the sake of my family and friends. But for a while now everyone has been busy, and most have drifted away, and the closest person to me (my sister) has almost fully cut me off because ""she doesn't have time to hang out or talk anymore because she needs to get her new friend group to like her more"". She did this straight after my cat passed away, who I had since I was a kid and was my biggest reason for staying alive. I tried making friends online but it's exhausting for some reason (possibly from a past trauma when I was a teen). Also I'm 28, almost 29, and I have absolutely no life.

Any advice on how to kickstart your own recovery without professional help?,"Hey

Basically Ive been in and out of various mental health treatments since I was around 10/11 years old. I dont want to get into why, but the UK mental health system has really let me down and not helped me as much as I need. 

Im currently unmedicated (tried five different SSRIs since I was 15, not worked) and not under any kind of counselling. Where can I begin to start recovery myself? What advice does anyone have to get the ball rolling, taking it day by day and looking after myself in spite of it all?

I want to make like a recovery plan but Im not even sure where to begin

my 13 year old sister is feeling suicidal and i dont know how to approach her,"im 16, me and my sister never really talked about stuff like this, nor did she and my parents (including me). when i was her age i was severely depressed aswell, but i had nobody to talk to so i had to deal with everything myself. plus i had severe social anxiety which made me feel more alone so i never fully got the concept of having support in my life, or going to therapy or even having real friends to talk to. btw, im somewhat okay now

  
moving on to my sister: shes somewhat social. she hit puberty over half a year ago. she completely changed her looks. she started wearing black, baggy clothes and spends one hour doing full face make up, which our family wasnt so happy of, including me, since it was so sudden and she doesnt even need it. but honestly i dont care about these things. anyway, she has a couple of friends but ive heard she has gotten into a fight with one of them which she has mentioned a couple of times to me and my family but we kinda brushed it off since she didnt really wanna talk about it either. then she has gotten a boyfriend, whom she broke up with 2 weeks later into the relationship because he cheated. and honestly she didnt seem affected by it, i think its clear why. 

main thing she does is keep her room really messy. like insanely messy. about 5 hrs age there was leftover food on the floor, flies everywhere, sticky desk, make up stains everywhere and so on.... my dad were obvously not happy. he came and had a meltdown about her room. yesterday and today to the point where he took her phone. i could tell my sister was upset cuz she didnt go out at all, only to the bathroom for like 5mins. and this happens quite often. i can relate to this aswell, i could even say its normal in our family to get yelled at this much for our rooms but its really apparent she doesnt take it well. on top of that my parents tell everyone INCLUDING ME that she has an ""additue"" and she needs to fix it. but its just her being upset for my dad contantly yelling at her. theres many other things id mention but it would be too much. and on top of that, one of her friends moms told our mom that my sister and her friend were talking about how shes self harming, how she feels worthless ect. and its just so weird to me, why are u spying on my sister? and after that incident she has been wwearing a hoodie for the past 2 weeks. keep in mind its really hot where we live. and its just overall unusual.

  
anyway, i dont use tiktok, snd she does every day. so i had the random thought to check out her account, and it was full of depressed stuff. she was talking about how in her mind, shes fat,and she should stop eating less, or how she was hurting herself and had suicidal thoughts just because our parents got mad because she didnt clean her room. and thats when i got the idea of telling this to someone, because i seriously dont know how to approach this. maybe i should tell my mom, since shes more understanding than my dad. but talking to my sister wouldnt be a great idea since like i said, im still healing from my own things. i dont know how to confort people let alone my sister that im not that close with to this extend.

First time I self harmed with a razor. ,"I thought I was stable. I wasn't. 

I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

Do I deserve this?,"It's been 6 weeks since I lost all motivation to get out of bed, to go out, to go to work, and do other stuffs that I love before. I just realized that no matter how genuine and sincere you can be to others, there will still be unexpected people in your life that would only want to keep you just for their convenience and would only use you for their own selfish goals. After they got what they needed, you're just like some trash that didn't exist. This really hurts the most especially if the person you didn't expect was the one whom you poured your heart the most.

Not only was my heart and my trust broken but also my hope for love. It's always been this kind of situation since college, which was 9 years ago. But the pain that I'm feeling now is the worst pain I ever felt in my whole life. I can't sleep for more than 2 hours just because of having so many WHY'S in my head even though I take sleeping pills. Like I just want to swallow all of it in 1 take just to see if I can get the peaceful sleep I want and hope to never wake up again. Because I can't seem to understand why I always wind up in this situation. 

All I'm thinking is what's the loss of one genuine life if the world is full of shitty people.

I need help,"I’m a 18 yr old female. 
A lot of what I see on here i more normal I worry that what I’m about to say isn’t or that I will be judged. Please I just want help.

I have homicidal thoughts. I hate it. I hate most that I could do it and possibly get away with it. On a metric scale I’m attractive. So I know I could get them to follow me and do as I say till they realize what’sabout to happen. For background I was abused severely when put into the care of my aunt for a few years. I was sexually abused and was having hard drugs tested on me regularly by her boyfriend. After going back to my parents life was better until my dad passed. Watching him die in the street was the hardest thing I’ve had to endure. My homicidal thoughts began as nightmares I would see people bleeding out but never be able to make out any distinct features. It quickly escalated as I began hunting animals like deer. It went to intrusive thoughts about harming strangers, most of them had nothing in common except the fact that they where men. After meeting my friend we’ll call her Lilly it stopped momentarily. Until she committed. After that it was stronger than before. It became an itch burried in my skin I couldn’t reach, id try to scratch it till the skin was falling off it quickly became something that caused se me to almost twitch even in public. And the thoughts became more gruesome, I’d think of setting them loose in the woods and hunting them. I made a list of all the sex offenders in my city and watch them when I can. Staring at them and stalking. Hunting. There where moments if I staved myself enough that I didn’t feel the urge as much do to pure exhaustion. I’m introverted but do well socially so when I reconnected with my highschool friend who well call j it stopped for a moment just like with Lilly. I’m some ways he reminds me of her in his own way. The feeling of safety and comfort. After a while we confessed we had feeling for each other but due to his religion we didn’t and haven’t so much as kissed. And in someways I think that’s something I love about our situation. That it’s pure. Recently my thoughts have been coming back resulting in SH to try to stop them. I love him just like I did Lilly. I want these thoughts to stop. I want to have a normal life. Another factor that makes this so hard it that most days I can’t tell if I’m even alive. It feels like it not real. Like nothing is. So I struggle finding ways to change when I’m not sure what happening to me.

Apparently it is a sign of depression but at the same time it helps me get the mindset of  because I’m worth nothing, everything is a gain from this point. 
My point of this text is though things are getting better why do i feel lacking, and why do i keep craving more self hatred. Why don’t i think more positively like others and look for more optimistic ways of self improvement. Things being good makes me feel stagnant. I even miss a certain level of chaos in my life. I just need a fresh perspective that can help me navigate through whatever this is.

why is it so hard to find treatment,I’m 16 years old and have been struggling with depression silently for years. My parents have been somewhat aware but only decided to get me help a few months ago. So many psychiatrist offices don’t have any availability. They had to call countless places and talk to a doctor just to find one that would see me. At this point I felt mostly past the point of being helped and was wary about getting my hopes up and being disappointed. But I couldn’t help the feeling deep inside me that thought this was my chance to finally get better. I’d dreamed of this day for years. We went to the first appointment and spoke to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with depression and anxiety and suggested I go on medication. She referred me to another psychiatrist in the office who was better suited for my needs and we set up my first session to be the week after. However the next week when we showed up we found out that the therapist I was supposed to see decided to take time off. I cried as soon as I got home. I was so disappointed. Despite my better judgement I truly believed I would finally get the help I desperately needed. I was so close. The little hope I had is gone and replaced with hurt. ,Historical-Habit4861,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e378zp/why_is_it_so_hard_to_find_treatment/

I dont know how to live when I am better off dead.,"I live a fairly fine life, a good house, and food to eat, not rich or anything but not poor either. I am well-loved by my family so it amazes me why I push them away and can't show affection. Ever since I was a tween I have always felt some sort of misery. It was so sudden you would have thought a nefarious witch came and cursed me. I wouldn't consider myself a good person, quite the opposite actually. I have worked on getting better, disregarding my insensitivity, and bettering my inferiority complex but little has made a difference. Because even though I am extremely sensitive to others' feelings in a way, I tend to still be indifferent when they show me, love. I have no real life skills as a teenager as a result of being spoiled my whole life. Almost everything has been given to me in a platter, and I take it always with a grain of salt. I have fairly good friends, but I lost most of them because of my personality. During quarantine, my whole mentality rotated to a 360° I was badly influenced and out of control. And now that whole demented persona is just stuck. The main reason I want to die is because I feel like I am better off dead. I don't bring anything to the house instead of being a student and attending school. But other than that, I am truly a burden. I can't do house chores without people telling me to because I feel judged. I don't know why and how. My looks also play a part, I am extremely unsettling to look at, and I do not have the best personality either as mentioned. I have so many imperfections I don't even look human, no matter how much I try to see it. I feel like I disgrace the world just by existing. To add fire to the fuel, I don't have any good talents, I don't sing, or dance, and the best I could do is get an above-average grade in the class. It bothers me how I can be ""good"" but can't be the ""best"" in academics. The only passion I have is reading, I love to read. But of course, all good things come to an end, and I have been little by little reaching a slump. I don't know what to feel. I don't know what to do. 

It's like I am a body without a soul. Maybe I have been programmed this way my whole life, I cannot think of a single trauma that can cause this. I don't know what I did in my past life to end up in this state. I truly believe I am better off dead. 

I don't want anyone to pity me and I don't expect anyone to. I just wanted to get this off my chest and share my experience.

Need to figure out whats going on ,"Hi everyone,

I am a 16-year-old female, and I’ve noticed some significant issues with myself. Unfortunately, I can't get a proper diagnosis because my parents are against it. Here are the problems I've been facing:

1. Academic Performance: I used to excel in academics until the 10th grade, scoring 95% in my exams. However, this was below my expectations, leading to burnout. Since then, I've subconsciously put in less effort, resulting in a significant drop in my grades in the 11th grade. Even when I try, it doesn't seem to be enough. I now experience extreme exam anxiety, which causes me to freeze and lose focus during exams, despite knowing the material.

2. Action Paralysis: I often find myself unable to start tasks, even when I want to and know I need to. Deadlines pass, and I’m unable to take action, which has severely impacted my productivity.

3. Attention Issues: My ability to pay attention has deteriorated significantly. I struggle to focus on anything for long periods, and this has been an issue for a while but has worsened recently.

4. Emotional Numbness: For the past year, I’ve felt emotionally numb and detached from everything in life. I don’t feel happiness, sadness, or any strong emotions, positive or negative. I also struggle to care about anything, which makes me feel worse, but I don’t even care about feeling worse.

5. Anxiety and Disorganization: My anxiety attacks have intensified. I frequently lose items, am very messy, and often disconnect from conversations, going blank for a while. I’ve lost interest in activities I once enjoyed, like working out. My daily routine, which used to drive me, now lacks structure and consistency.

6. Chronic Fatigue: I am always tired, regardless of how much rest I get.

Despite multiple attempts to improve my situation and get my grades back up, I keep failing to stick to my commitments and feel all over the place.

Can anyone offer advice or help on how to manage these issues?

Thank you.",Sad-Regret-8625,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2ymj8/need_to_figure_out_whats_going_on/

I’m depressed because I ruined my life ,"Growing up, my childhood was trash. My family was trash. There are a lot of scars from alot of damage and trauma. Things I remember that I shouldn’t. Wish I didn’t. Memories of bad things. Those things have followed me into adulthood but I strive to be better. I raised my daughter away from my family so she didn’t grow up normalizing the behavior. I pretend like it doesn’t affect me but it does and yet I still try to put in a brave face. I still pretend like I’m a good mom. A good person. A good wife. But I have just proven that I am not. Fuck even typing this out sucks. I have never felt genuine love. Just from my kid. But never anyone else. Never from the people I want to feel it from. Never from the people that I love the most. I just never feel it. I never see it. I never believe it. Day in day out I beg and beg for it. I just want to know I’m loved. My husband works hard for our family. He’s the best there is. But I didn’t feel the love from him. I told him time and time again. My depression was bad and getting worse. I was trying meds and on and off counseling. But nothing was helping and I fell deeper and deeper. I had a weak moment and I latched onto attention I felt from another male. I thought holy shit someone actually showing me they like me? Someone actually having conversations with me? Someone who understands the depression and anxiety I am dealing with? I fell for it. And I fucked up. And that one mistake has flipped my families life upside down. I destroyed the man who loves me. My kid has to see her parents cry every single day. What the hell have I done?

Something is seriously wrong with me and I need some perspectives. ,"I don’t even know where to start.
I am in my late 20s and for the longest time, I have not been able to do much with my life or accomplish anything. 
A little background, I was good until highschool, I did more or less well academically and was pretty academically inclined, was considered smart and everything. The problem started when I finished highschool, I took a few years off(because of some issues) so I started college late, it already took a toll on my confidence and I felt too old and too late for everything. 

Eventually I finished college and I haven’t been able to accomplish anything else eversince. 
I blamed it all on my laziness, I rationalised myself blaming my failures on my laziness and lack of trying. 
But since last year, I really made a conscious effort to try. I really did try so hard mentally to focus on the task at hand, made small goals to accomplish, made a routine for myself. But I noticed that I could never focus on anything for more than 20 mins at most. Even though I would make a mental note to not let anything distract myself, I would find myself hours later being distracted by the smallest of things and would feel like shit for having wasted all those time and it would repeat all over again. 
I tried to lock my phone up somewhere far away from my room thinking it was the source of my distraction but my mind would still find something else to waste my time on. It became a mental torture at this point. 
It seems like I would rather do literally anything else than the task at hand it doesn’t even have to be enjoyable at that point. 
It’s like my mind has another mind of its own and i lose control of it. 
This has caused me some major distress. 

Another thing i’ve noticed that, nothing feels natural and comfortable to me. 
For example, even when i’m doing a simple task of doing laundry, holding my clothes or the jar of detergent feels uncomfortable and unnatural to me, like i’m not holding it properly or something. Everything I do feels wrong and uncomfortable. 


I just really need some perspective on this because i can’t access therapy at this point.

Porn memories from nearly 6 years ago coming back and causing me extreme distress. Please help me,"I am 21 and when I was 16 I was using porn too much (2-3 times daily). I was always straight and knew I was straight but I escalated to a picture of a feminine mans butt (I had a thing for girls butts back then). There was no nudity and it was shaped exactly like a girls due to surgery.

I only pmo’d to this a few times before stopping. When I stopped completely I realised my actions and I had so much regret and for a year I was in such a depressive state as I thought I ruined my sexuality. I eventually came to the conclusion that it was my porn use that caused this and that I am still straight.

Fast forward to now I a few weeks ago I remembered my actions and I can’t stop thinking about these actions and I’m spiralling out of control. I just can’t believe that I did that back then and even though I have no desire to ever do it again, it’s just really paining me to think of my past actions.

I regret these actions so much and that’s the truth. I’ve no desire to ever do it again.

Can I still be straight despite doing these past actions? Or am I not straight because of these past actions?

I am surrendering ,"I am 29m severe depression, PTSD, ADHD and anxiety. I fought my way and got a good career and immigrated to Europe. I tried meds, weekly therapy, going out, events, meeting people, gaming, even several posts, everything I can.

I lost desire to do anything and have no want to do anything. The healthcare system in the Netherlands is very stressed and can't do more for an expat. I don't have the courage to suicide. 

So I will just surrender. I will stay in bed looking at the ceiling doing nothing unless I have to go to the doctor or do some work. Take showers only if I would inconvenience others. I will use excuses to push the few people in my life away. Set up some papers in case I die. Just give up on living and wanting to live. Stay in a catatonic state.

Psychiatrists, therapists, suicide line workers, friends, family, strangers, no one really cares and will be agitated if whatever magic wisdom they throw at me don't work. From compliments to encouragement to blame to advice, it's all hollow.

Please help me understand my boyfriend’s depression,"Hi all,
this is gonna be a long post so many thanks in advance for your precious help.
I’m struggling to cope with my boyfriend’s depression as I don’t really know what’s going on in his head, therefore I don’t know what’s the best thing to do to help him and us as a couple.
So - to give you a bit of background: we’ve been together since last November; when we met and started dating we realised we weren’t just physically attracted to each other - we had lots of things in common and saw life the same way. When ok, he really is an amazing partner, very caring and supportive. I felt (and still feel) very lucky to have him. He disclosed his depression struggles to me from the beginning; he suffered from it all his life (he’s 28 now) and that is due to his bad upbringing/bad life experiences, + a feeling of being powerless to change things which are wrong in society.
When I got to know him better, I started to see his depression episodes unfolding and I also learned to see when they start as he becomes very apathetic and tells me he feels “cold and empty”. I’ve been observing the pattern and the length of these episodes varies: they may go from a few days to more serious ones which last a few weeks. During these episodes he bottles up, doesn’t go to work and neglects himself - he just lays in bed with no strength for anything; needless to say, during these times he disappears from me too and sometimes without warning (we don’t live together). When he’s ok and back to normal, he always tells me not to worry as he adores me so I should never take his illness personally - he just needs a break from everything as he can’t deal with anything. He doesn’t want to take medications and never did; I fully support this decision as I 100% agree. He simply wants to find the core reason of the problem and deal with it himself. He recently started to see a psychologist once or twice a week, but I can’t really see any improvement: some days he feels very happy and hopeful but some others (the majority of them) he’s back to his struggles. Now I know that depression is a serious disease and it may take him years to get over it, but my questions are: will he ever be able to fully recover from it, or he will have to embrace the illness all his life? Is it possible for me to get used to it and for us to have a fulfilling relationship despite this?
I’m asking you because he doesn’t want to talk too much about it with me.
Also, I tend to worry a lot when he disappears without warning, as I can’t help but questioning his feelings for me or - even worse - I start getting paranoid that he may kill himself. He told me more than once that he never feels suicidal, just apathetic so not to worry. However, I can’t help but texting him and telling him I miss him and I hope he’s ok, but I don’t usually get a reply during these episodes so I really feel left out.
As a partner, what’s the best thing to do/way to deal with him disappearing? Should I not contact him at all knowing that he will come back to me when the episode subsides?
I look forward to getting some insight from other people who struggle (or did struggle) with depression. Thank you so much!!",Staybeautiful77,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e3453f/please_help_me_understand_my_boyfriends_depression/
No one to talk to,"I'm 29 years old and have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember. The past year has been the worst it's ever been, living on autopilot, getting no joy out of almost everything, thoughts of dying daily. The one thing that would always keep me going was my wonderful girlfriend. Without her I'm not sure I'd be here today. Just being with her was enough to keep me going, she was the one thing that never failed to make me happy. I never shared any of this with her. I was so afraid of losing her if she saw how truly broken I am. The past year has been so rough, I know I haven't been the partner she deserves. I've felt so numb, stagnant, so tired and despite my efforts to hide these things they've bled through into my life. Making me into someone I wish I wasn't. She deserves so much more than that. She left me two days ago and I am completely broken. I was barely holding on before but now I don't know if I can. I let my depression take away the one good thing in my life.

I feel so tired ,"If I wrote everything that happened to me, people would say, “Wow, you’re a fighter” or “Try to find happiness.” The thing is, I kinda stopped having feelings when my mom passed away from an aneurysm. It happened out of nowhere. She was my best friend, and I was only 13 when it happened. I lost my person that day, and as months passed, I noticed my brother seemed sad but was and still is distant from my dad. My brother revealed to me that my dad was having an affair. He knew this before my mom passed away but decided not to tell her because he didn’t want to make her feel sad or lonely. I understood that, but my world fell apart when he told me about this. I knew why my dad didn’t always come back from work, why I felt the urge to go to my mom’s bedroom and just hug her until I fell asleep.

My brother and I confronted my dad, and he admitted it. He also told us he had a kid with this woman. That phrase took everything from me. I met this woman and even lived with her for a few years. She is the worst: so mean, yelling at me for no reason. I always cried because my dad knew this but never did anything about it. My brother started a new life; he got married and had a kid. My relationship with my brother is 1/10 because of this, so in a way, I lost my brother too. That woman and her son moved to another country, and now they live there. But a few weeks ago, I heard my dad calling them and using all these cute names for his son. It made me realize something: he was never like that with me. It made me feel like I’m not enough, like I’m not enough as a daughter to him. So I decided that maybe the best I can do is just live in peace with that. But still, I wish I had a father who didn’t decide to break his family.

I didn’t live with my father for a few months. I met a “nice guy,” but I regret it with all my heart. He was my first, and he got me pregnant. I got an abortion. To this day, I have flashbacks of everything: the way he treated me, when I told him he got me pregnant and gave me an STI. All of this made me realize that since I lost my mom, I was looking for love in the wrong places. Sometimes I feel like this world is not for me. Not once do I feel happy. When I wake up, I feel like I’m not real. I feel numb. What is the purpose of me if I’m just going to feel this hurt? I don’t trust anyone. I don’t say anything to my friends. They think I’m okay, but I’m so tired of pretending. Nobody knows that the nights for me are the worst because I remember everything and I cry until I fall asleep. I feel used, and I don’t wish that on anyone.

There are signs that I’m depressed: my hair is thin, and I had the most beautiful curly hair, but now it’s so thin. I don’t go out. I decided to study online this year, so I’m always in my room. I don’t talk to anyone, not even my family, if I ever had a family. Sometimes I think that there are other worlds out there, and maybe in one of them, I’m happy. I’m happy with my mom, and I got to learn how to wear makeup, how to dress nicely, how to recognize good boys from the bad ones. I know this is just a group of people telling their feelings, and maybe I’m overreacting, but please be a good person. I would like to know that good people exist, and I hope one day I stop having this feeling of regret, of not being enough, of feeling used, of feeling that someone touched me and hurt me, and deciding that maybe it’s better if I just end this once and for all.

There's no point when the world is doomed to apathy?,"hi, been dealing with intense depression and painful emotions from CPTSD after moving out, and I kind of just wanted to say somewhere that I don't think it's ever going to get better. I'm unemployed and can't afford the copay for a therapist, and even if I Do learn how to tolerate this, we live in such a horrible uncompassionate evil world where people are willing to fall into line and give up over making a difference even when they have the capacity to. I wish there was an actual rebuttall to this but it's just the truth and it makes me feel extremely bad. I don't believe actually""getting better"" exists, like why am I even trying?

I am so tired of everything.,"Like the title says, I’m so tired of everything. Being depressed fucking sucks. I feel like I don’t have anyone in my life that would listen and take me seriously when I’m talking about my problems. My mum just says you are 23, how can you be depressed when you didn’t even experience life! There will be harder times that just a heartbreak! There are people that have cancer or people that are homeless! You can be lucky to have a roof over your head! How can you not be happy? Don’t you fucking think I don’t know that? Then one day it gets better and I’m laughing, and suddenly everybody thinks I’m okay. Cuz you can’t laugh when you are depressed right?

When I tell my family about wanting to off myself no one takes me seriously either. But I’m so tired of living, I can’t even picture myself when the hard things come, when I can’t even handle a fucking breakup and some school stress. I feel like I’m not made for life. I’m too weak for this all. 

It’s so nice outside but all I do is lie in bed and cry all day. I would love to go outside and go on some adventures, it’s summer break over all. But I have no one. My best friend is working all the time and when she’s not, she’s with her bf. And I don’t have any other friends like that. So I’m just a fucking loser that does nothing all day. I’m so jealous of people I see on instagram going on a vacation and just having fun. 

I hate this generation. All we do is scroll social media, and that fucks us up. We are all pushed to go to university, make more and more and more money, buy a house that will bankrupt you, be hot, workout or you will not reach today’s beauty standards. And then our parents ask us how can we be depressed when we are so young?

I’m just so so tired. God.",Veverkovaa_,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2zdum/i_am_so_tired_of_everything/

My mom's an asshole,"My mom blames me (18M) for my little brother's behaviour which would be playing games and not going outside much I guess, which wouldn't be true. Anyway I dont spend a lot of time with my little brother because I really cant think of anything to do with him and he also has a different dad so we dont hangout almost ever. I do hangout with my step little brother (has a different mom) and I do enjoy spending time with him because he always asks me out and has something to do. no my little brother does not ask me or anyone out and so we dont do stuff together. I just dont think it is my fault that he acts like he does, he also has adhd and I dont know how that affects his mentality.

 I feel like he might be depressed and one cause would probably be our mother who loses her mind if we dont go do something with her. For example today she asked my lil bro if he would like to go ""frisbeeing or swimming or to fucking hell"". Obviously no one in our family likes to hangout with her because she acts like  she is a good person and all but then just decides to fuck all and ruin everyones day. I have tried to go with the whole family to somewhere like camping but everytime something slightly annoying happens like my brother saying that I dont like this or something along those lines she can't stand it. 

I am depressed bc of her constantly saying negative stuff about me. She told me angrily that ""people at your age are working summer jobs!"" yeah obviously when they have supportive parents and not a crazy single mother. I would like to tell her that but Idk what the conequences would be so I will just try to bear her until I can move somewhere else.

Should I start taking them again,"I 20F started antidepressants for around 3-4months and it benefited me a lot. I felt happy and if not happy then extremely at peace… most of the time.
The downside was I’d have random nausea every now and then, I gained weight, was often tired, low sex drive (would rarely be able to finish) and even though it helped with my low moods, I have bipolar 2 and i swear it did nothing for my hypomania (not that I’m sure it was even supposed to help with that).
Having barely any energy and gaining weight started to make me so insecure which was making me unhappy so I stopped them suddenly which I didn’t know until recently that is not a good idea.
Anyways I’m losing weight and working out more since I have more energy and not eating as much as I used to (not under eating but no longer over eating) but the bad thoughts are back, I’m starting to feel unhappy and more anxious again. 
So now I feel like I’m stuck and can’t decide what to do:
Option 1: take them and feel mentally stable when I’m home but anytime I’m out in public I’m so insecure because I’m gaining weight and don’t have energy to exercise which would make me sad.
Option 2: don’t take them, risk going back to bad habits to cope but even if I find healthier ways to cope and I lose the weight and feel confident while I’m out, often when I’m home I can’t sleep, I’m overthinking and crying a lot.

I have been seriously depressed since this happened.,"I worked 40 hours and got paid $8.75/hour.

In her daughter’s eyes, this woman can do no wrong. 

My girlfriend tells me we have a new job and I don’t have to worry because we’ll have money from now on. 

Her mom gave her the job. Said she was taking it over and trained her for a month to do so.

So we go clean this huge church with two buildings from 7pm-5am once a week for a month. 

We get the check for $1400 and her mom “changed her mind,” and she tells me she agreed to give her mom $700. I was pissed af. So I told her if she gave me anything less than $700 I would leave her. So I got $700, she gave her mom $700 and she kept nothing. Her mom took the money knowing her daughter was getting none of it. 

About a month passed and all we’ve been doing is fighting and we’re not the same. 

I finally gave her $350 bc I don’t care about the money. So we ended up making $8.75/hour.

Now she and her mom clean the church without me and it’s made me very depressed and feel alienated. We were both so happy to have something that was ours.

No matter what I say or do she will not see my side and anything I say she says I’m talking shit about her mom. She said I put a hole in her heart. Idk what to do. I just feel royally fucked by her mom and by her for not sticking up for us. But I still love her.

Really tired of trying to make friends,"I guess its over - I have to stop trying. Bc of more than my appearance.

Idk why but someone new said “are you poor” when they saw my place; and I have fillings in my teeth that are dark and no enamel bc of gallbladder attack puking for 4 years.

I have multiple expenses and thats why I dont fix cosmetic things plus I dont think it matters. I have a nice smile and my teeth are not yellow they are white but no enamel.

I have $2700 of damage from an ice sliding accident on my vehicle and more inside. 

I have greys in the top of my head. And I often limp or waddle bc of chronic pain as well as bad sleep making my skin dark under eyes etc. 

If I saw a person like that, Id not be so dumb and naive.


NONE OF THIS CHANGES FOR OVER A DECADE. Yes I have all the medical care I can but none treat this stuff. They dont cover it and uhh… 

I cant get around with out my car. 

And Im frustrated that all this stuff make me not allowed to socialize. Everyone rejects me. And just seems to criticise things that just DONT MATTER. None if my teeth are rotting or look like what youre thinking. Oh and always dry lios from the medical and well all my life. I do masks and more it just doesnt change.

How am I supposed to make my life happen when people just reject me for looks or other reasons that are out of my control. All my spending money goes to medical treatment trying to improve myself and these conditions. 

I dont think I can keep fighting it alone. Whats the point if Im treated like a bum when Im not a bum. In my garage in my building and when you try to fill them in or discuss it they just go “I dont remember sayign that” and it was last time. And you try to address it anyways.

Im sick of ppl. Saying its just a few - nope its everyone for the last 10 years. Everywhere. And I dont know what to do anymore. Its Canada so dont go saying its cheap its over $200 to switch a filling and even then the enameless teeth wont be matching up much and its not the fillings only. 

Cant get around without the vehicle…

Can’t let go of my fiancés past. It’s crippling me.. ,"Can’t get over his past..

Having trouble letting go of my fiance’s past.

Hey there, so I met someone online in the year 2021, and we started dating. It was quite serious and was a commitment to get married eventually. The relationship was short lived since he had an all time low in his life by this time. He lost all his finances, his father met with An accident right in front of him home and slipped into a coma and he felt too much for himself and couldn’t deal with any of it , also because he is autistic I think. He ended up breaking up with me. The same day we broke up, he had a meeting in a different city and since he couldn’t afford a hotel room ended up staying at a colleagues place. They both were drunk , and she “got all over him” and they ended up having sex. Now be says he never wanted it, never planned it or such but it just happened and he regretted it deeply right after. And at this point he never thought we would ever speak again. But he could just not let me go for the next 5 months because he somehow thought he could make the money to come to me. But when he realized he couldn’t at this time and had too much for himself he decided to put a stop to it. Also, he started dating someone in these 5 months to make money off of her and entertained me at the same time. 

Fast forward to a year after , he comes back to my life and we end up meeting for the first time and falling in love all over again. Everything was great for over a year except for some fights here and there. But we were happy. Now we are in long distance for a few months until our marriage and I’m crippled by his past and what he has put me through. I just can’t seem to get over it. 

He is a great human being now, he’s changing so much and developed so much. He has redeemed himself and has come clean about a lot and makes sure I feel safe and secure no matter what. But, I can’t seem to let the past go. And idk what to do anymore. Idk if time will heal or it’ll never get better. Kindly let me know your take. I really want to let go of the past, forget even - if possible. I want to be with him for who he is today but somehow the past is crippling..

I just examined my life,"Imy 78yo.
1- Due to a radical Proctectomy 27 years ago I was made impudent. About a yesr year later my wife left me for a man who is a 5 count felon and just got out of prison. She met him while we were doing a prison ministry. 
2- as a result of the surgery and radiation treatment for that cancer a permanent side effect was chronic diarrhea. 
3- I had a relationship with a lady that had MS. I pay all her bills. Cooked our food and did the household chores. I found out she was having an affair. So that ended in 2000 
4- 4 years ago I had a stroke. Although my family was very supportive I have five kids I chose to live in an assisted living facility. I also have to use a walker. I met a lady my age not realizing she was an avoidant. I went through love bombing till this relationship (?) ended.  Nice thing about assisted-living is almost everybody wears diapers. 
5- this year I lost bladder control. Between being totally incontinent and having to take usually 2 to 3 showers a day just to get clean and wet wipes don’t work with diarrhea.

The point of this is that I am totally incontinent, impudent, require a walker. 
   Oh I failed to mention during this past 4 years I’ve grown a beer, being totally incontinent and having to take usually 2 to 3 showers a day just to get clean and wet wipes don’t work with diarrhea. Also while living here I’ve added beer belly and tits so I’m very  unattractive

It feels like I'm at the end of my rope,"I've been having depression and anxiety for most of my life and at this point I don't even know what to do to cope. Everytime I've thought I had friends I've discovered months/years later that they were actively harming me. I've only ever had one friend and I don't feel like I can keep being myself around him or I won't have even that, but it also feels like it doesn't matter whether I'm myself or not because we're reaching an age where our life is starting to get a bit more settled and since we don't live anywhere close to each other I can't be a part of his life. My parents love me and do everything they can to support me which is why I feel even worse thinking I'm never going to get better and keep leeching off of them. Everything I've done to combat my conditions has only helped me forget about them for a few months at best, and when they come back I'm reminded it doesn't matter what I do because they are always going to be there. It feels like the only thing I want is a normal life with a normal job, a couple hobbies, a bit of social interaction, maybe a significant other, but I don't even know where to find people, and even if I do I just push them away. I try to get into a community or a group of people or whatever and I feel like I shouldn't even think of opening my mouth (or typing) because I'll only be a bother. I've never experienced love, I haven't been loved and I haven't loved or even been attracted to anyone, I'm 29 and I haven't even kissed anyone in my life, but I still want to experience love. I can't help but think how little sense that makes, but even if it did make sense it doesn't matter because I still have no clue how people meet and connect. I've asked for help, both to people around me and to professionals and it's only made me realize there are very few people interested in helping me, and even with them it feels like I'm beyond saving. At this point I only want to die but I still feel like I can't do that to my parents, but at the same time I'm terrified of the idea of having to live like this everyday for however many years I have left.",Varlify,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2ysdc/it_feels_like_im_at_the_end_of_my_rope/
Feeling of depression,"I'm 15 going 16 and I feel depressed, I can't and don't want to reach for help, I don't know why... Every sounds just feel so loud in the morning or night, it pisses me off like someone doing the dishes in the morning. When I listen to music, it feels so overwhelming and fast, I don't really know if I'm depressed, I'm just so tired of life and feel like I can't catch a break. My room is filled with cans and wrappers, my clothes are all over my floor and every time i'm in the same room with my mom, I stop what I was doing and just wait, I feel tense and anxious, then can relax a bit. I just so tired of this.

I just want to escape ,"Sorry for my bad English! I hope you guys are having great Sunday! 

Ive had anxiety about my future. Im not allowed to be wrong or have mistake on myself. I wanted to be perfect and I ruined the day when I made mistakes. but I could overcome them because my ex bf gave me great energy. He did nothing tbh - just seeing and talking to him, it gave me great energy 

Recently, he broke up with me out of the blues. He has been depressed since January so I suggested him to see therapist and he did but he is prescribed antidepressants since June. After that, he became rude, aggressive - totally different person. He was dream and world to me but he just left me. On March we were on break for 2 weeks and we solved everything well. I was the only one who knew his problem and depression and I was for him when he needed but now there is no one near me. Luckily, my parents understand me but I have no friends 

I’m worried and scared of everything about my future and myself.  I feel like I can’t get a job and can’t find any friends and ppl who love me. And I’ve felt guilty for my ex bf. I just want to escape from this situation. I just miss my happy moments but I’m sure I can’t have moments like before. I just hate myself.

"I've been depressed since 11, nothing has changed","Basically the title. I'm 18 now. Been suicidal all 7 years. I don't even knoq why I'm still here. Pills don't work, therapy doesn't work. I feel incurable. I probably have more going on than just standard depression/anxiety, I've been told I exhibit traits similar to borderline personality disorder. When I was in school I was bullied because somehow kids could sense I was different before I could (I'm transgender). I don't have many friends in real life, most are online and far away. The friends I do have IRL I don't see often, if at all. Only text a few times a year. No one is ever there for me. I've cried out for help so many times and no one will help. I've tried to schedule therapy appointments to see MAYBE if I try again it would work. I get ghosted. And I really don't feel motivated to try to schedule elsewhere. I want to rot in my bed until I just die. It feels like no one cares about me and the state of the country (USA) does not help me at all. I need help. I can't find any. I live my life so disassociated because I don't wanna be here. I used to have a perfect memory, and now I can hardly remember what I had for dinner. I can't bring myself to do things that make me happy (play guitar or photography/editing photos). I feel so lost.

I need someone who understands me,"My entire life, no one has understood me. Not my family, not my friend, not my wife, nor anyone I've been told to seek help from. I cannot accept the world the way it is. It is not simply ""the way the world works"" for me, because ""the way the world works"" is what depresses me. There is a price tag for what one needs to survive, there is a price tag to fix the world's problems, or how much the GDP is of a planet/star system we have never visited. 

I have spent a large majority of my life watching or learning from Fight Club. My father kicked me out to be alone for years, and the cynicism from both my friend and what I learned from Fight Club changed who I am as a person. 

No one can understand why I am so depressed when people have ot worse. The fact that people have it worse than I do is why I am depressed.

I don't think I should stay on it because it's causing extreme nausea to the point I can't think of food. EXTREME dry mouth. Like I can't get rid of it. My heat tolerance is even worse.

Passive suicide thoughts,"# Passive suicide thoughts

Is there anyone out there who struggles with passive suicide thoughts?

English is not my first language but I will try to explain the best that I can. This is not a post asking for sympathy, I'm simply looking for someone out there who struggles with the same thing and has overcome it/ found a way to excist without it taking over their life.

I'm a 25 year old girl, I have a boyfriend and own an apartment, and have a decent job. Still, I feel like my life has no meaning. I feel that life in general is meaningless, and this world is full of hurt, and I don't understand how I can keep on living. I think about dying every single day, yet I'm not strong enough to go through with it. I don't want to hurt the people around me who do not view the world the same way I do, but I can't stop thinking about the relief of simply not excisting anymore.

I feel that I have so much hatred inside of me and so much anger, both towards myself and humanity itself. People are so cruel, both to other people, to animals, and to the planet. I think the world would be a much better place without humans. And I feel so alone with these thougths, and almost like they're ""illegal"", because humans are viewed as on top of the pyramide.

I see now that this post is just a mess, but I really just need to know if there is anyone out there sharing these thoughts, because I feel so alone. I wish there was a ""stop""-button to life, and that I could be able to end it when I wanted without all the dramatics. That there would be a painless way to go, without doing something that hurts. These thoughts have taken over my life, and even though I'm not ""struggling"", because I am able to function in the day-to-day life, I don't understand how much longer I can keep going with this chaos inside my head.

SO is there anyone out there who has been struggling with this and has found something that helped? A way to find meaning in life or just rewire the brain to be happy again? Or are there any motivational speakers/therapists that are known for struggling with this, but has found a way to erase those thoughts? I hope this reaches someone who can maybe share some advice.

Thank you in advance.",ingrid1234567890,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2ll60/passive_suicide_thoughts/

My self esteem issues have gotten way worse.,"A few days ago I made a post speaking about my life this year, included there was the fact I was broken up with recently. 

For some context, early into the relationship there was a moment where he expressed how non-attractive I was to him, my skin color/race (I don't believe he's racist, I just think he doesn't find my race's features attractive.), my weight, even my hair, it wasn't at all his type, so despite my best efforts, he wouldn't return any physical affection. I know I should've seen this as a massive red flag and probably ended the relationship there, but I didn't, I was head over heels for him. 

I've never had a great self esteem, I often see myself as lesser, as non-important, as expendable. Post my breakup however, those voices have gotten louder and louder, and now I can't stand looking at myself in the mirror without feeling like a disgusting looking freak, so much so that I've actually teared up from looking at my own reflection, and included in this, I've become starved for physical validation.. to be found attractive by someone else.. I want to be loved and be told I'm not what my head tells me I am, be given the validation my head won't give me and my ex surely didn't..

undeniably the most horrible part of my life,"turned 15 recently.

  
since it hit summer break, everyone's response is always hanging out with friends or playing games all day. I do that as well, starting from June 12th till now(it was fun) but I hate being pulled back to reality and all the things I need to face sooner after I graduate or go to college. I suffered from symptoms of autism, TICS, adhd and had vivid daydreaming as a coping method which keeps me happy and grateful the whole time and stuff like that. Mother always told me that I'm going to end up nowhere happy as her because I played videogames almost every day(I did study as well, but I hate when she yelled at me, told me to revise and told me how addicted I am. I just want to enjoy my three months worth of holidays well after stressful studies of IGCSE and exams.

maybe I couldn't live without my devices, but I just don't want to be reminded of studying for the first couple of months as I need relaxation time.

and I hate when she tells me that I'd end up begging on the streets because I hated reading actual books(I preferred fanfiction, but she despises when I use the internet to read). I don't like when she encourages me even though I already am reading other things, I absolutely despised on how I'd be brought out of my colorful world where I find escapism. Most of all, since I'm in a British school curriculum, I'd be hitting year 11 after august passes. I overthink a lot and I wonder where I'd end up in college/the future, and that thought scares me and brings me desolation since my mother tells me a lot about my life's failure if I continue my 'addiction' right now, but I simply wish to be left alone so I could turn everything all around and such. 

  
everything's just so blurry for me. I've had people give up on me because I hated studying during a period of time, and my past trauma has managed to glue myself to a screen so I could seek hope from my online friends and games or so. It's like taking drugs, but in a safer way. When the adults ask me which college I'd go, I'd be stressed due to my uncertainity and no one likes that feeling too. 

in conclusion, I wished I could've been the better child our family looks upon. Absolutely despised my mother for being mentally abusive, sometimes physically and how she let the whole family down by being jobless and not having a uni degree right now. Wished that I was actually good at maths and better in chemistry, and wished that my mother never expressed how mad she was when she realized that I hated physics.

Please help me. I am struggling ,"Hi. I'm struggling at the moment. Let me tell you my story

Up until last summer I was happy. I had never felt lonely or depressed. Since then I moved to another country with my ex. We broke up after about 5 months after moving. I was heart broken then but out of nowhere over very shortly after the breakup. I met another woman and it made me happy again and I was completely honest with her. She knew my situation completely and while I was not able to do everything I wanted due to financial issues of moving to another country while still paying a mortgage back home.  I also have chronic sciatica that is stopping me from being able to enjoy even the most basic of things. I do have surgery coming up to fix the herniated disk so hopefully that will be sorted soon. 

I have gone on a bit of a ramble. Tldr. I am so fucking lonely and I am struggling to make friends. I don't know why it's so hard to make friends since turning 30. I just need some ideas to try make friends that doesnt involve running into another relationship as I don't think I have it in me to be heartbroken again with no friends to speak to. I've been thinking about killing myself daily with almost every other thought. Now I am not going to as honestly the only reason I could think of is that I wouldn't want to upset my family. I have spoken to my family about how I'm feeling but I don't know. They tell me to go out and do stuff. But it's not stopping the dark thoughts I am having. I work most of the week and I do go gym and keep myself busy for the most part. But I do find that while I am doing said things. I am just thinking the whole time that I want to die. I don't know if I am just lonely, depressed or if I am healthy but do just have a shit life and want to die.

But still no matter what I do to change my hair, my clothes my personality anything, I still don’t feel good in my body. I’ve tried to be myself, I’ve tried to change myself for other people but still to no avail. It’s so hard being ugly, some don’t like me just because of the way I look no matter the way I am, or what I do. I have tried substances before nothing crazy just w**d and alcohol. It didn’t do anything for me, it didn’t make me feel good or feel any better about myself, so I have since quit doing all of that. I also am addicted to p*rn which is a problem I constantly hate myself for. I’m am a Christian and want to change for the better it’s so difficult especially in this day and age.

The saddest realization I've ever had,"I recently started going to see a therapist after I broke up with my ex of 3 years, we were absolutely perfect for eachother, there was nothing we didn't both like or agree on. We started dating in high school and we were instantly the image of a perfect relationship to everyone we knew, even in our eyes we were. For some back story, as a child I was left to defend for myself since I was roughly 6 and it never got better after that, year after year I would be not only abandoned, but abused, told I was never good enough for anything, and left to fend for myself and my siblings, and as I grew up I got into the mindset that no one can be trusted or relied on, and that the only time someone loves me is when I can be useful too them. I never left that mindset till I met my ex, she showed me that all that was true, but after almost 2 decades of dealing with people who I thought loved and cared about me, just to have them turn once I wasn't useful, it was difficult to believe that for the first time in my life someone loved me unconditionally.
For the first 2 years of our relationship it went amazing, we were the image of an amazing relationship and I knew I found my true love, yet that old feeling came back to my mind and I found myself unintentionally becoming closed off from her and slowly self sabotaging the relationship until one day she left me, and it broke me. I'll never forget that feeling... I dont feel anything anymore. 

So I decided to try to get help, and this was where I had the worst realization. Now I believe that my ex loved me unconditionally, but I realized that I'm more scared of being loved unconditionally then I am of dying alone. Why I'm scared I don't know, I have no explanation of this feeling, I've never met someone who is scared of being loved.",frosty1804,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2kbkd/the_saddest_realization_ive_ever_had/

Who's really out there for me and who's just along for the ride. The idea of everybody abandoning me stuck so deep inside my mind.

"My manager makes me want to log off the life game, and I can’t escape him.","It’s been arguably one of my worst years ever. I caught my fiancé having a primarily gambling related set of emotional affairs, I was set to get a promotion and it was all a lie, my fiancé (who we decided to do couple’s counseling) lost two relatives in the span of two months so we have to put our problems on hold. I’ve had issues with the step-kids not caring for their brother and speaking ill of their mother and I during school to their father and step-mom. My son has been diagnosed on the spectrum and is nearly non verbal. One of our cars broke down and when we got it back it had more lights on it than dodger’s stadium. And the manager whose position I was supposed to fill as he made a lateral move to a different position has engaged in some strong micromanaging of me and my fiancé (as we work at the same job regrettably) and more or less bullied me by maliciously following the rules while himself being a hypocrite. Once lectured me for showing up less than half an hour late as “not properly representing management” and proceeded to be late every day the entire week. I had no issues with him being in the role that was initially set to be given to me, or that he chose to stay despite being offered to move. I loathe his poor treatment of my coworkers as I am a supervisor, and I despise how every shift with him is so draining that it directly affects my home life. 

Our house is in disarray, the lawn struggles to be maintained, im having a war in the kitchen with flies, and I barely replaced a broken garbage disposal that has caused the underside of our sink to warp. The roof has several leaks, our mortgage is barely maintained, my desk and hobby workspace is often filled with other people’s clutter, and don’t get me started on my social life. 

I just need to vent. I can’t catch my breath. And I had to delay both of my therapies for about a month just to save money. And above all, being a man, I don’t feel like because some of these issues aren’t that big a deal that people will tell me to just “get over it” and “be the bigger person” as if I haven’t always done that. I’m done. Being that person doesn’t protect my peace and if this manager looks at me sideways one more time before I find a new job, I’m just gonna dig my own grave because the things I feel like doing are gonna warrant that I no longer live anyway. Unfortunately for me, these are only feelings and I have no energy to exercise any of it so if push comes to shove, I’ll probably just shut up and quit like always and put on a smile on the way out the door. I don’t want to live anymore.

My therapist always tells me because I overanalyze everything to just look for what is real and what seems to be real is that nobody really cares that I exist, and I can simply be replaced for anything else within reach.

Im 21 years old and i have Crohn's disease. If you don't know what it is, it's causing inflammation in the gut.

Well also i been doin the same exam for 5 years repeatedly. All my friends are in college now but I am doing ALevels for the 3rd time. It's my third and last time doing this exam. I know i can get into a good university but i just cant study. Im trying to do my best but i cant.  My mind doesn't allow me to.  

My tummy hurts because of crohns now. And i know theres a connection between gut and mental health. 

My situation now
:i wanna leave this house
:i dont have friends 
:i dont talk to anyone.  Im home all day. Trying to study. But i dont study
:i feel like a falier

All i want is to be nude in the nature, or get a hot bath or walk on a beach.  

But i cant do those because my exam is 4 months away.

Why do I wake up every single morning with suicidal ideations? ,"***TRIGGER WARNING SUICIDAL IDEATIONS***

Why do I wake up every single morning with suicidal ideations? They used to last me almost most of the day and not go away no matter what I tried to do. Now it only seems to be when I wake up and then it seems to digress through the day, it just seems to disappear and then I don't usually have issues anymore for the rest of the day. Some days though, it still would come and stay throughout the day and or go away and then come back later as well.

Then with my sleeping, even if I sleep 7 or 8 hours, I still wake up tired. Most of the time I wake up extremely tired and fatigued like I haven't slept.

I've also tried going to the hospital several times and there's been issues when I've went there (if you would like to know what happened feel free to ask and I'll tell you). I also went inpatient at the mental ward part of the hospital back in February of this year, but I ended up not getting any help in some issues occurred while I was there (if you would like to know what happened, feel free to ask and I'll tell you).

Which honestly, I don't know how much longer I can take of feeling like this every single day (Which I've been going through this at least since January)!",BigJ1230,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2w07s/why_do_i_wake_up_every_single_morning_with/

Alone,"""Are you okay?"" 
Yeah I'm fine.
My brain screaming ""NO I'M NOT OKAY!!!""
I'm the only one that hears it. 
I haven't been okay in 20 years. I distract myself with people that I deem need me and push hard on that. I attach myself to people that are not okay thinking I will be the one that can help them find the place to be okay. A broken man trying to fix broken things hoping it fixes him.
I'm angry all the time and I push it down so nobody will feel it. I plaster a fake smile on and laugh and joke all the while dieing inside and no one sees. Silence is deafening and the only thing that truly scares me is being alone. I starve for attention while I tell people that I'm an introvert. 
I don't ask for help because I feel I can't more over I feel there will be none. I've have honed the craft of mimicking people in situations to fit in to blend and hide amongst the crowd. For acceptance. When I'm comfortable with a person the see the real me but it could take years for that. I don't trust easily and when I do I give my full heart to that person romantic or not. They have seen me and accept me. But every one leave in time. On thier own accord or death. I am left alone and it hurts and it scares me. I leave situations I can no longer deal with. Because it's easier than putting on a smile taking the assault and feel worse than I did before but if they feel better than that's all that matters. It's not them it's me. 
""You are so smart""
""You are so talented""
""You know so much about everything."" 
""You could be doing so much more.""
""You are so calm all the time""
""Nothing phases you.""
I learn things so I have the answer when someone needs it. I put that to practical use so I can help when someone needs it. If I thought I was good enough I might be able to focus long enough to do more. I have to stay calm or I will explode. 
I get stuck in routine because it is the only sense of normalcy I get in my life. It's the only thing that makes me be able to deal. When the routine is disrupted by outside forces (IE not me disrupting it) I don't deal very well. I develop new routines that become the new standard when it is disrupted in a major way. I'm straight forward and expect people to be the same but my mimicking skills gives me a way to be straight forward without upsetting the other person. Most of the time. My brain works differently I'm not ""Normal"" people expect something that I can never give them no matter how hard I try. I do try. People don't know how to talk to me. Or deal with me. They think they can for awhile but realize that they can't and I'm left alone again. At one point I tried to find the solace in the loneliness and I did for awhile. But it doesn't last never does. I attach myself to people and give my heart because I need that connection. And I so badly want to connect. Nothing is as beautiful in this world than looking into someone's eyes and seeing them and being seen by them. That connection can't break not for me. You showed me something that very few have seen. That is the true beauty in this life a connection with another person on the planet. Another person that has wants and desires and hopes and dreams. When someone leaves the beauty leaves with them. But connection is always there. Because when you find them again they feel it to. Even though I seem disconnected in a moment with a person I'm not. I'm there in the room but my mind is in a thousand places also. What you are saying is connecting with those things also and deeming the meaning of all of it. In the middle of a conversation I might say baby elephants are adorable even though we weren't talking about animals at all. My brain made 200 connection with what you said and baby elephants is where it landed. Now I can never think about baby elephants without thinking about that moment between us.",coldfireisdope,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2s27d/alone/

There’s so much happening that i just don’t say, I just hate everything man.

Albinism makes me feel like I should end my life,"This post may sound very dramatic, but it is my true relationship with my condition.

In my early teenage years I had a very bad period and I got depressed. The reason is that during that period I first really realized that albinism would severely limit my life, and since then I've started to experience suicidal thoughts.

I really feel like I'm not understood by anyone when I talk about my disease. I have a severe form of oculus albinism which gives me a 20/100 vision, and a slight form of oculucutanous albinism. I can't even stand at home with windows opened without the sunlight hurting my eyes, and apparently no one seems to take this seriously. I've just stopped talking about this when it happens and just go somewhere else. I also have a lot of difficulties doing simple tasks like using a computer, using a smartphone, reading a book, watching tv and, of course, driving. 

I think I will eventually end my life for this. It's something I have thought a lot about in the past, and sometimes I've got really close to doing that. I started to get psychological visits, but that didn't really help. I know that I have to accept it and that there are a lot of the worst genetic diseases out there, but in the real life it seems like everyone has a normal life, and that hurts. It hurts a lot. I can't accept the fact that I will never see the world as it truly is, or that I will never be able to see the sky without sunglasses, and without my eyes that still hurt while I'm wearing them. 

You can tell me the things that everyone keeps telling me from years, such as that I have to accept it, that I can still have a healthy life etc. I'm just not normal, and what I'm seeing isn't normal. I'm not even supposed to still be alive and got this far and I will never be like anyone else.",Neither_Affect_6139,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2aapz/albinism_makes_me_feel_like_i_should_end_my_life/
It's all a blur (advice and context welcome),"I can hardly make sense of my life. The majority of it has felt like two incohesive blurs. The first blur was my late middle school to high school years. I was sick; bedridden for the first year or two, then too ill to really be part of the world until I started to recover when I was 17. I tried to attend high school, but only managed a couple months in person each year before needing to drop out because I was too sick to keep attending. I was in and out of hospitals, so outside of the... what, maybe 8 or so total months of high school? Probably less. Outside of that, everything was the same. Sit on my ass all day, watch YouTube, watch porn that may or may not have been really fucked up, play video games, and occasionally go to the hospital for testing. At a certain point I started to forget what year it was. By the time I was 17, I had to check a calendar just to remember my age. Then the second blur. Sure, I've gotten better, and so has life to an extent, but everything felt like a blur. It still feels like a blur. Maybe because of how quickly everything happened? I started a recovery routine, then 2020 happened, then there were family issues, then I held a shit job, left that shit job, attended college for a little under a year, spent months trying to enlist, failed, then have been looking for work ever since to no avail. At least I can remember the date and my age now. Work and college also really helped me learn to be human again. Still, I pretty much just kept to myself when I was working and in college. People were nice to me in school, but I never formed any real connections. I never hung out with anyone, only occasionally BS'd with a few guys during school hours, then lost contact with everyone after a graduation I didn't attend. It doesn't feel like I finally started to truly live, just that I got used to being around people again. I still can't socialize for shit. It's hard even with relatives. It's weird interacting with people my age, and especially with teenagers. When I was trying to enlist, I temporarily trained with a group of people who were all younger than me. It doesn't help that I'm short and baby-faced. It's a really weird feeling when people younger than you call you ""kid,"" or when a high school student treats you like the archetypical shy underclassman you see in movies. People have't been rude, but it's jarring to interact with high school students only to realize that they've had WAY more life experience than me. It feels like a reminder that roughly a decade has just flown past me. Nearly half my life has just flown past me.

I don't think I've had a bad life. I think I've just an incredibly uneventful one. I was talking to someone I know about it. They said that, even if I don't think so, I'm actually traumatized from illness and isolation. Is that really trauma though? I was never abused, I never saw anyone I love die, and I've never been in a crazy disaster.

Well... any thoughts on the matter would be appreciated. I'd certainly benefit from outside input or context.",ManyRefrigerator8300,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2v3pu/its_all_a_blur_advice_and_context_welcome/
I feel too tired to live anymore,"My family is not my comfort zone. It never was. The older I get, the more weight I can feel on my shoulders. My mom has really high expectations of me. Since I was young I would always fight with my mom over everything, even the smallest thing like making a noise while eating. She‘s like a perfectionist and wants me to be like her too. I know she’s always telling me that it’s for my own sake but it’s too much for me to handle. I wasn’t good at school when I was young, so when my grades came out I always got scolded by her. She said things like, „Is it that hard to be good at school?“ „Why can’t you do something that easy?“ Can’t you be someone I can be proud of at least once?“ She does triggered some traumatic feelings of me. Because of what I went through I grew up with low self esteem and the feeling of being afraid of making mistakes. When we moved to another country I did my best with everything. I got better at school and even graduated from a prestigious university with a good degree. I thought maybe now my mom will be proud of me, but her reaction wasn’t like what I expected. She never praised me for my achievements and started to criticize me in other ways. She cares A LOT about what other people think about her. So I had to be the perfect daughter she can brag about. The problem was…I was never good enough for her. I don’t fit the beauty standard and I already know it but getting this told by my own mom always makes me feel hurt. She REALLY CARES A LOT ABOUT PEOPLE’S OPINIONS. I always get comments like “Why are you so fat?” “Did you gained weight again?” “I told you not to eat.” “You’ll never be beautiful if you continue to look this way” It’s not only my weight she cares about but also my face. She even had me do a nose job and a lip surgery to look better. I always have to wear Makeup and dress well when I go out. And she’ll always comment on my outfits like “why are you wearing wide jeans? It makes you look fat“ and even said things like „What are you doing? What will other people think of me because of your actions? They‘ll think I didn’t raised you right.“ I‘m so sick of those comments, there were a few times I wanted to end my life. I can’t be that perfect daughter she expects me to be. And because of that I‘m more fond of my friends than my family. But at the end I got betrayed a few times. Being kind and genuine to others doesn’t mean they’ll be kind and genuine to you. I never learned from the same mistakes until recently. Reality hit me hard. I feel like I don’t matter to anyone except they need something from me. I‘m always trying to help or at least be there for the people around me but no one is ever there for me. I do have a few good friends but most of them live in different countries now. Now I‘m at the age where I can earn my own money and treat myself to good things and even travel a lot. I feel like I do it to just escape reality in short term. But after coming back to reality, nothing changed. It was a temporary happiness. I know that therapy might help me but to be honest I don’t want the be treated. It’s not exactly like I don’t want to be healed but I want to leave more. I lost my reason to live. Is it wrong if I can’t handle all of this and just want to disappear instead of getting treated? Because I tried to cope with it my entire life and I have enough of it. I endured it more than 20 years and now I just can’t help but feel like maybe it’s better if I don’t exist.

I'm lost,"Life is an utter mess. Got nothing going for me; not even a job, or a friend. Crawling out of this hole feels like the toughest task I've ever faced. I don't think if I even know how to.

I'm quite tired. I can literally feel the absolute mental exhaustion seeping into my body. Imagine those spells in video games that sap your stamina or your life force. It's like I've been living under the influence of something like that for years. Only my tank is empty now.

When I speak to someone, I can sense myself dissociating. I watch myself say dumb or insensitive things and ruin a potential friendship. I try to distract myself with my old hobbies; I feel absolutely nothing. I try to create goals and change my circumstances, but I quickly breakdown when I remember I have nothing to look forward to. 

I have nothing to hold on to either. There's nothing good in my life. Not a single thing. I'm quite surprised myself that I'm still around, and that's not really a good thing. Pain builds on pain. Every passing day is harder to get through than the previous one. 

I'm almost sure that death should solve all these problems for me. I used to say death didn't scare me. But dying does. It's a wholely unfamiliar experience, and I've never had a particularly adventurous spirit.

Need advice,"I guess I wanted to make this post because I want to gain some advice or reassurance in my understanding of why I have experienced mental health issues relating to anxiety and depression for the past 7 years (since I was 18, now 25). I want to share a background of my experience with these issues and hopefully gain some insight to how I should move forward, because it has been a constant struggle. Like everyone's mental health experience, it is unique to them and it is extremely complicated, stemming from an array of different things such as childhood trauma, nutrient deficiency,, microbiome health, etc. 

Background:

Finishing highschool was definitely the trigger to my first anxiety episode. Navigating what I wanted to do with my life was stressful and I felt as if for the first time in my life, I did not have a clear path. At the time, I didn't even know it was anxiety, but during the year after highschool it was like a flip switched inside of me and hasn't been the same since. Not to say there werent times where I was anxious in childhood, because there definitely was, but this was the first time I really felt the physical and mental effects of suffering from anxiety. This was presented in OCD like behavior with repetitive thought patterns, overthinking, physical tension in chest and stomach (like an urge to cry), insomnia and other symptoms of anxiety. I ended up going straight into full time work and struggled these things regularly but would go days or weeks of not feeling symptoms. It was always irregular and I never knew why I was feeling these things. I have always been healthy and conscious of my diet, sleep, exercise and was never abusing drugs or alcohol so it was a bit of a shock when these symptoms “randomly” occurred. I was determined to find an underlying biological or physical reason for these feelings and have and still do try supplements, more exercise, eliminating certain foods, regular sleep etc which all help to an extent but have never actually resolved any issues.

These issues persisted and it was shitty but I was able to manage myself and it never really spiraled until I had a bad insomnia episode a couple of years later. This was a combination of the anxiety I had in general which ended up causing anxiety around going to sleep and they just fed off each other. After really struggling for a couple of months I decided to try medication and was given lexapro. Once the lexapro started working, for the first time in ages I felt a sense of normalcy. I was stable, my random anxious thoughts and feelings in my body were gone, I genuinely felt like the best version of myself. My sleep was good again and I stayed on lexapro for about 9 months before deciding I wanted to come off, thinking I had healed my brain of whatever weird neurological misfirings that caused these problems. I hadnt been to therapy at all at this point but I was so determined that I had cured these problems and didn't want to stay on a medication for whatever reason - I think I was ashamed of being on medication and was also scared of staying on them long term. 

For almost a year after I stayed off medication and continued to try to heal myself naturally. I had improved with understanding these feelings, I had a better grasp of the causes or what my anxious brain thinks that's wrong with my external environment. I finished my degree and was working full time doing something unrelated to my studies and had decided to move cities and also had just been accepted to a serious full time job. The stresses of these triggered an insomnia episode again and I said fuck it, ill go back on the medication. However, this time the lexapro didn't work and for some reason made me feel depressed. I hadn't really understood what depression was like but now with what I know, its closely related to anxiety. Anyway, I moved cities and although my life improved because I made new friends, was enjoying living out of home, moved to a place I really like, felt less lonely I still had these shitty feelings. I came of the lexapro after trying it for 2 months and decided to get prescribed a different medication. I was determined for this one to work and was put on zoloft. The zoloft killed my anxiety but made me even more depressed. My moods were very up and down. Zoloft didnt work for me either and I decided I really needed to go to therapy instead of using a medication (I know, I should of gone to therapy long before any of this but it was hard as I didnt communicate properly to my parents or friends and wanted to solve the issues on my own.

I went for 10 therapy sessions and learnt a lot of information about myself that I didn't know. I believe the stuff I learnt gave me a clearer perspective of the disorder in a way I hadn't seen it. That is, that it has deep roots in my subconscious brain that stemmed from things that happened in childhood. This was helpful for sure and improved some aspects of it but I was still struggling everyday with these feelings. I weaned myself off the zoloft and stayed off it for a couple of months before ending up going back to the doctor in distress asking for a new medication. I tried Lexapro again for 2 months and it didn't work. I was also going through a lot of stress from a breakup, at this time so I think this may have impacted the efficacy of my third time trying lexapro. The lexapro was making me feel shit so I tried prozac. Again, for two months I stayed on prozac and hated it. This one by far made me feel the worst. I felt like a zombie. That was about 4 months ago. Situationally everything has improved and I am a lot happier with things objectively speaking. They are the best they've ever been but I'm still a mess and have this depression/anxiety that will present itself all the time. I am booked into therapy again which I am excited for. But I don't know what to do. I feel like I have tried everything. 

I have read a lot about psilocybin therapy and have used psilocybin many times recreationally but I want to explore a high dose trip alone, and hopefully find some sort of cure to this disease. I understand it's not going to be a quick fix thing but I am losing hope and desperately want to do something to heal myself. I think starting therapy again and doing a big trip will be beneficial. Its fucking annoying that everything in my life is great, yet I will randomly and sporadically get these thoughts and feelings. At the moment it's a lot of depression. I hate how it makes me spiral. I want some advice on whether I should try another medication. I loved the first time I was on it and it worked but i'm afraid of doing the whole trial and error thing and experiencing all the side effects like I did the other times.I want to find something that will work for me and stay on it long term.

help ! 😀,"I don’t know what to do at this point I hate myself SO much.

I’m going into college this August and idk if it’s worth it to go anymore, I feel like I am unworthy of love and I hate myself so much. I’ve never had a relationship and I have no real friends. 

I have a twin sister (I’m also a girl) and we’ve pretty much had the same friends growing up. Back then I thought it was annoying because I hated being paired up with her but now I feel like a burden to her. I know she thinks I’m a loser with no friends (true) and she feels obligated to hang out with me bc of our parents. Throughout high school, I hung out with her and her friends and pretty much just faded into the background. Not a single person was actually friends with me because of me- they only hang out with me because of her.

Genuinely (and I’m not delusional) nobody cares about me; not a single person. I feel worthless and dumb and ugly and unlovable. 

I know everybody is going to say “you’ll meet your true friends in college” but I genuinely feel like I am incapable of making friends. I feel like the more people know about me the closer I’ve pushed them down the inevitable timeline of when they’ll eventually leave me.

I hate who I was. When I still had therapy, that helped me deal with that a little.
And I absolutely loathe what I'm becoming (or not becoming in a sense).

It all just feeds each other and is a kind of vicious cycle it's just exhausting.

And as I feel paralyzed in my perceived inabilities, self loathing and learned helplessness*, time just marches on and on.

(*Anyone have any more buzzwords?)

My value as a person in this society decreases exponentially.
With time my interest in anything deteriorates.
I only do skinner box NPC things and what keeps me alive. Depersonalization is getting worse. I only feel bitter and empty now.

The constant that is the high expectations laid upon me as a kid stays ever unreachable.

To then also live in a world that seems to be hell bent on telling you everything is going to shit...

It sucks to always have the intrusive thought of the easy way out looming in your head.

Feeling so empty and confused,"I spent most of my teenage years suffering from extreme depression and anxiety, though I have improved, I still sometimes find myself regressing back to my old habits. I have diagnosed borderline personality disorder along with endometriosis and Autism. With those along with my past trauma, I never really know why im feeling depressed or how to fix it in the moment. I am currently finishing up my bachelors degree and starting work on my Masters in 2025. This summer I have been feeling extreme burn out and just feelings of helplessness. I dont really have friends in my home town so I spend majority of my summer alone in the house. Some days I find myself waking up and not leaving my bed until 6-9 hours of the day have passed. The end of the summer semester is approaching and ive been struggling with school work due to lack of motivation and other things, the guilt from falling behind is also getting to me as well. My boyfriend is amazing, but he has a lot of mental issues as well and its hard for me to open up to him because I know he is fighting his own battles right now and as much as I love him, he has never been as invested as our relationship as I have so I fear that if I start asking for help too much he will decide its for the best for us to split up.

I am sleeping over 15 hours a day, lost desire to do anything and don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to burden them and don't want to talk or see anyone now or in the near future.

Loved one cannot choose to care about me if I choose to self sabotage.,"I have struggled with depression and anxiety for my whole life. I have gotten significantly better, I am able to manage the illness better and it does not affect me in serious ways. I have support from loved ones and a safety plan in case things were to be bad again, but it has not been the case in several years. 



However, there are times I feel myself slipping into a depressive episode and fall back into my bad habits. Recently, I felt myself slipping into a episode, and I mustered the bit of energy I had to let my loved ones know that I needed some space and time alone. I chose to self isolate. The reason was because I needed time to process the emotions and felt like a burden to my loved ones. During this time, I was not able to think rationally and I was very critical of myself and I felt unworthy, ashamed and exhausted. The urge to self isolate hasn't happened in a long time, but I gave into that urge due to the strong emotions. When I felt a bit better after a few days, I reached out again. 



My loved one told me that he did not like this behaviour, and that if I were to self sabotage again he cannot choose to care about me anymore. 

He told me, a mistake only happens once and choosing to isolate, whether it is inconsistent or not, is a choice. If I get the urge to isolate and I act upon it, and there are times I don’t want help from my loved ones, then he just can’t continue to care for me. 

He said I am free to do as I please, withdraw from people, isolate myself. I just cannot expect him to care if I do. 

He said if I cannot allow someone who cares about me to help shoulder the burden of my pain and suffering, then his mental energy is better spent elsewhere.

What he said is completely valid. However, I think of this situation differently.



I think that life is very unpredictable and people will experience a lot of grief and a lot of pain that can make you lose sight of yourself. It can be extremely difficult to reach out for support when the illness is convincing you that you're unworthy. I don't know what will happen in the future, I know that I will probably make the same mistakes again and choose to self isolate. But I also know that during this time, I need my loved ones there for me no matter what. I need people to be there for me when I feel unworthy of love, ESPECIALLY when I feel unworthy of love. The more warmth I am shown, the more strength I will have to get out of the muck. It's a battle with the illness. It's not that I don't want support, it's that I believe I am unworthy of support. I constantly try to fight the negative thoughts that occur when I feel this way, somedays, it's too much for me and I give in and believe them. 



Now, I am very upset. I am sad because someone who I love very much and loves me very much said that to me. I have to accept that I will probably make the same mistake again, because I'm on the road to recovery, and I have to accept that if I do, he won't be there for me. 



Please let me know what you think of this situation, I am looking for advice and support, and different perspectives. Thank you.",jkbch,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2k4q9/loved_one_cannot_choose_to_care_about_me_if_i/
This is the worst night of my life. 38M,"I’ve really fucked up everything around me. My mental health has plummeted and I can’t get out of my own head. I’ve been pacing in silence for 5 hours. I’ve tried to lay down but my heart won’t stop racing. I live in the middle of nowhere, have really shitty job that only schedules me for 4 hour shifts and pays 12 an hour and my schedule is never consistent or a full week. My car’s rear seal is busted and it won’t hold oil any more. The last time I put some oil in there was so much smoke everywhere. So I’ve been relying on people within our community to get me to and from work, over a month late on rent. Lawn is overgrown got no mower, landscaper hasn’t shown up despite putting me on the schedule 3 weeks ago. New meds are killing me, I wish I can find the list of all the meds I’ve been on through out the last 9 years. And the worst part is I’ve turned to alcohol to numb it all. I just can’t make anything work and follow through. I keep making the worst decisions. I know this all sounds like complaining, but to make matters much much worse is seeing all of you struggling with life too. Everyone’s got their own story or nightmares going on and it hurts my heart to see you all in pain. I’m so sorry everyone’s experiencing what they are. This world is relentless and depression is the worst thing that could have ever happened to all of us. Oh and our electric is so past due we’re getting shut off on the 17th. And my wife works from home so yeah. She struggles too and when you got two people struggling with anxiety and depression, you can’t talk to each other when you need support from the one person in your life. Family never reaches out, I have one fuckin friend but he lives in a different state. Man I just need to stop. I need help and support. I’ve found myself screaming at the top of my lungs in desperation and despair.

"I once tried to end it, but failed so hard that I cheered myself up. ","Idk if this is the right place to share this, but I think it might be the only place. 

This happened around 20+ years ago now,  back when I was in my first or second year of high school. I was getting bullied every single day, had no friends, nobody to talk to about it, and was an absolute ball of emotions.    
Most of the time I was just pure rage, because how the hell could the teachers turn a blind eye, when the bullies weren't even being subtle? So many kids bullied me, that the teachers just made the mathematical decision that it was better to ignore one child, than punish 5+, and ruin their education. 

So one day, I was at my lowest, and decided to end it all. The issue was, I hated the pain of being cut, drowning wouldn't work because I kept coming up for air, and I couldn't tie any knots. 

So I decided to use my own school tie.... This is when it gets funny.

I had one of those closets that's built into the wall, with a shelf and a bar for hanging clothes hangers...so my absolute dumbo brain, decided to put my tie through the bar, hold onto the other end of the tie with both hands.... And lift my legs off the ground.... Like a god damn looney tunes character. 

I only dangled for a few seconds, before I lost my grip and came crashing down with an almighty thud. 

It was at that point, that I realised how unbelievably dumb what I tried to do was. Not because I wanted to live, or because it didn't make sense to punish myself for other people's actions. Only because the way I tried, was so cartoon levels of dumb. So I'm just lay on the ground, my school tie messed up laughing my ass off. 


Sadly when I went downstairs, and tried to casually tell my mom that I had just tried to hang myself, the timing could not of been worse. She was right in the middle of watching a talk show about depressed kids who had tried to kill themselves. So when I told her what I had just done she yelled at me for making it up, saying that the kids on TV had genuine problems, and I was grounded and sent back to my room. 


It wasn't till over a decade later that I told her what I had tried to do, and reminded her of how she had yelled at me. Honestly I think even a decade later from telling her, she still hasn't forgiven herself.

But for me, it's weirdly one of my funniest memories. The time I tried to off myself like a god damn looney tunes character. Like I was gonna pass out, yet somehow keep holding the tie. 

I still have depression, though it's hard to tell some days, due to all the genuinely legitimate reasons we all have to be sad, and not want to get out of bed in the morning (like if my life was great and I felt this way, then it would be obvious it's depression, but even people without depression would agree that life sucks right now) but I never tried to kill myself ever again, thanks to how dumb I felt when I did try.

Got prescribed lunesta (rant),"I (23f) am in a major depressive episode due to a shitty life situation and also because I’ve had depression on and off since I was 10. My usual SSRI (Paxil), which I’ve taken for nearly 10 years isn’t helping at all anymore. I’ve tried Wellbutrin, which I hated because it made me tired for some reason and I didn’t feel comfortable taking something that could cause weight loss (literally was 93 pounds at the time he prescribed it so no idea why he thought that was a good idea). Mirtazapine, which is way too sedating even at a high dose (we’re talking sleeping 17 hours). Mirtazapine didn’t have any positive effects on my mood and honestly made me feel worse. But it got me to a normal weight so I at least feel better about my body.

My depression puts me in a perpetual state of exhaustion, but it makes it hard to fall asleep at night. Once I’m asleep, I easily sleep 8+ hours and it’s hard to get up. Apparently my psychiatrist only heard “can’t fall asleep” and prescribed Lunesta. I cancelled the prescription immediately once I found out what it was. He didn’t explain any of the dangers or that it was a controlled substance.

I am literally incapable of feeling positive emotions right now. I’m incapable of feeling joy, and doing things I like. I can’t feel happiness or love. Everything makes me sad and I feel numb. All I feel is darkness and I’m tired of feeling like this.

Me (19F) and My Partner (20M) Almost Broke Up Over My Depression ,"My partner has been on vacation for two weeks and recently returned. When he was gone, I had a depressive episode (honestly, not my worst one, but still), and long story short, it led to us almost breaking up over the phone. His main reasoning was that he already ""deals"" with it with his mom, has had bad experiences in the past, and is going off that. Essentially just saying that having a depressive partner would be too ""difficult/hard"" for him to deal with, even though he hasn't made a huge attempt to cater to me personally. This is the first time he's seen me like this.

A lot happened in between, but I ended up basically saying that we aren't breaking up until we (he) try. But now, especially after summarizing it, Im wondering if I should've just let him leave. I'm wondering if, at the next difficult roadblock, he's just going to be like, ""This is too hard; I'm out."" I don't feel as secure as I used to, as sure of his love for me, and I'm worried about things progressing because I don't want to be a year in, having poured so much into the relationship, and he leaves because things get hard. 

Some context: His mother also has depression and is a lot more volatile with it than I am. Same with past girlfriends. About 3-4 days ago, she asked him to help kill herself. His trip has also been overstimulating (his words) and not as pleasant as he wanted. Yes, I'm in the process of getting help; I need money to pay for therapy and to see a psychiatrist, but that's my number one priority. I don't expect him to sacrifice everything to try and fix me, but as my partner, I do expect him to be there for me and ride out the storm with me. It's only been about 4 months, so I didn't expect him to know all my ins and outs, but I did expect him to stay and try, and if I hadn't stepped in, I feel he wouldn't have. 

I also want to note that he has been an absolutely amazing boyfriend prior to this (opens every door for me, pays for almost everything, always compliments me, good morning texts, the list goes on) so this really through me. It feels like we should just call it quits but I'm wondering if there's any possible alternative.

TLDR: Me and my boyfriend almost broke up because my depression is too much for him to ""deal"" with. ",Responsible-Bus7806,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2l2rx/me_19f_and_my_partner_20m_almost_broke_up_over_my/

I’m just done,"This year has been absolutely awful. I got a divorce from an alcoholic who I was with for over 10 years, I was in the hospital for pneumonia, work has been incredibly demanding, my son doesn’t want to stay with me because “daddy’s house is bigger” and literally cries when I pick him up from daycare, my dog is a goddamn disaster - fighting with my kid, going bathroom in the house, my family is awful,I have no friends, I just got power after 3 days because of the hurricane that hit Houston. I’ve been taking care of my son because it was my custody day and now I have to keep him longer because his dad doesn’t have power. I never in my life thought I would get tired of hearing “mama” and “I love you” but I’m just so done. 😫

I just needed to get that out. I have no family or friends to turn to, I’m so alone.

I'm a glorified household chore robot,"It's literally the only thing I ever do anymore. I feel like I always have to be at someone else's beck and call and I've stopped thinking about that might drive me to keep living. I don't find time and energy for hobbies, and even on the rare occasions when I can try something I inevitably fail or don't try in the first place.

I no longer have any friends and my family doesn't know if these thoughts, as I hide them pretty well after 15+ years of practice, so I'm all alone... And frankly speaking I deserve nothing more. Happiness is a privilege that a thing as selfish, useless and disappointing as me does not deserve.

I've been to therapists and on medication but nothing works. It feels as if depression has become my default state, so ingrained in my personality that I can't see myself existing without it.

I was supposed to die 5 years ago now and I'm just living past my expiration date to avoid the pain I would cause to my relatives.

This isn't really a call for help as much as an outlet to help me cry and replenish my indifference shield, so don't feel bad about skipping this. I am already dead in everything but body.",NaAlSiO6,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2kd2s/im_a_glorified_household_chore_robot/
"I think I am depressed, but I don’t want to accept it","Recently it feels like everything in my life is going wrong. I have always been overweight and last year I lost 10kg and started the gym and was feeling great but recently after constant comments from others about my weight it’s making me anxious about how I am perceived, the last 6 months I have slowly lost interest in everything and don’t know who I am anymore. I have no attention span, disordered eating and I despise myself. All I do is binge eat and cry. I don’t enjoy anything anymore and I feel so stuck. I’m just sick of fighting with myself everyday.

Genuinely what’s the point ,"Everyone just leaves in the end without fail. No one has ever really liked me, my best friend of over 10 years stopped talking to me for no reason, I tried to arrange a day out with another “friend” recently and they just left me on delivered for days so it never happened. I’ve had friends before but I was always the last choice, the one who was walking behind everyone, the one no one really cares if they’re there or not. No one comes by to visit, no one calls, no one asks me how I’m doing, no one cares. There’s something about me people just don’t like, something so deeply imbedded into me. It has to be a me problem because it’s such a strong trend in my life. 

I don’t enjoy anything anymore, nothing feels good, video games are boring to me now. I don’t have any hobbies, I don’t have anyone to go out with, I just sit in my room and bed rot. 
Nothing is enjoyable. I either feel empty or my emotions smother me. I mainly just feel angry or sad and it’s just too much, I feel too weak to experience my emotions. There is nothing for me in this life, everyday that goes by I just get increasingly more frustrated at life, more nihilistic, more misanthropic. I don’t want to be like this but I can’t escape my mind. 

I’m so so jealous of those who have relatively “normal” lives. Friends, not poor, good mental health. Why not me? I wish I had just ended it all those years ago, I really fucking wish I did. I could have prevented so much horrible experiences, feelings. Fuck this shit. ",jezebel222,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e2easi/genuinely_whats_the_point/
"Just realized, the child inside is dead [Venting]","20M, been lonely for most of my life, just rewatched those old funny youtube videos cause feeling lonely, still laughed but it wasn't the same anymore.

I disgusted the idea that I'm having fun, I cursed at myself for being happy. I realized, the child inside me is dead after all those years of chasing after people, seeking their attention and approval.

I don't even know who am I anymore.

I've been lonely pretty much my whole life, I always tries to start and initiate conversation, I always helps people without asking anything in return cause I just wants to be their friend.

But why am I always the last choice? They only talk to me when they need something, they only ask me out because all their friends are busy, when I talk my words mean nothing and ignored or cut mid sentence,  
if I don't text them first, they will probably forget that I ever exist.

I really wanted to die but reading other thread about how my death gonna hurt my family, I don't want that.

I feel stuck. At this point, I just want to focus all the time I have left on this earth into my career and money, cause atleast I will still have some purpose to continue.

It's so tiring trying to keep going. I can't understand anything in life anymore.

Having Trouble Coping,"I struggled with depression as a teenager and was able to build up a life and move myself out of that mindset with some usual tactics, keeping busy, setting goals, exercise, etc. Almost two months ago I had laser eye surgery which has rendered me unable to work or drive.

I’m really struggling to cope, I just want everything to end. I have constant discomfort in my eyes, I have 20/15 vision but can barely see, I have to take medication for constant pain, I can’t even open a window because the outside light is too bright. I have doctors working with me but it’s been over a month with not very much improvement. I was working on my masters thesis which will likely be delayed, I’m almost broke because I can’t work, I sit inside all day struggling to use a computer that hurts me half the time because the screens are too bright even on the minimum brightness setting. I feel like I will end up on disability and I can’t handle that. I can’t be a burden on society, I can’t have nothing.

One dumb decision that everybody else will tell you is the greatest decision they ever made and your life is fucked. The clinic will tell you that you’ll be up and driving in 7 days. Your independent optometrist can tell you that you’re an ideal candidate. Fucked. My life is at a minimum delayed and going to be very hard for a year. At worst I am disabled and unable to function for the rest of my life.

I’m doing the world a favour by killing myself,"So an incident at work led to me having a MDD episode. I was off work for 4 months until my claim got approved and got into a treatment program. The program was great. I had a counsellor and a kin. I was doing great. But the depression didn’t go away. Next week is my last week of recovery. I cut myself four days ago after years of not cutting. Suicidal thoughts are back. I don’t know. I feel like since I was 8, I’ve always felt like I’m meant to go crazy. That I’m meant to end my life.

I’m not sure. I’m trying to get back into the workforce and had a couple of interviews. It’s very competitive out there. I feel like especially living in Canada as an immigrant of 10years, I haven’t felt like I belong anywhere. Am I not doing everyone a favour for killing myself? Since one less person to compete against for resources?

I’ve already thought off hanging myself. Maybe hinging a hook on the ceiling and getting a rope? I don’t want my boyfriend to see tho. I just want to stop feeling soooo sad and so so so lonely.

I went to work and I had to keep stopping what I was doing and run to the bathroom to cry. I ended up playing it off as allergies and went home early.

NEED HELP / ADVICE - my sister has been diagnosed with anxiety and depression,"my sister is 29 atm, I'm 23m. Diagnosed with anxiety, depression, and OCD when she was around 24-25, she has improved somewhat but used to fight with our parents, scream, break things, and verbally abuse us. She has expressed thoughts to end her life. In college, she had friends but cut off close ones after disagreements. Post-college, despite my dad investing in an office for her, she didn’t work and remains jobless with a disrupted sleep routine.

Frequent fights arose because she opposed my opinions, even when others agreed. My parents now stay silent to avoid conflict. I moved to another floor with my grandmother to reduce fights, but she still feels disrespected by me. She demands respect and acts like a second mom, complicating our sibling relationship. My parents have apologized for her childhood, but her inactivity seems to cause her to focus on past grievances.

She's seen many therapists, but only a few helped temporarily. She stops attending if faced with reality checks. She practices Reiki and other healing but behaves oppositely during arguments. I want to help but fear triggering more conflicts. Counselors suggest regular therapy, but she doesn't go. if we tell her a second time she starts to fight. We need advice on helping her improve her life without causing more conflicts.

Doubting if i have depression,"Im 21 and i have crohns disease. And i been doing the same exam few times repeatedly for almost five years now. My friends are going to college but im still doing ALevels. 

Because of that i dont have friends and i only talk to two of my best friends. I talk to my siblings over phone but me and my parents are the only people in the house atm. 

I know i have to study but i just cant man. I just wanna leave this shit and all i want is peace. I cant do this anymore.  I hate my life. I feel like a failure. I failed to get into college twice. Its my 3rd and last attempt. Im sure i can get into a college cuz i been working hard. But whats wrong with me.  I just cant do it.  

My crohns symptoms are bad now. My tummy hurt a lot sometimes. I just hug a pillow and try to bare the pain. I know there is a direct connection between gut and mental health.  My gut is messed up because of crohns. 

I started zoloft without talking to a doctor cuz they gave me a appointment date 2 weeks from now.  I just cant handle 2 weeks. My tummy starting to hurt so bad, idk if its because of zoloft side effects or crohns. 

I just wanna end this pain. All i want is to be nude in the nature, maybe sun bath, maybe get a hot bath in a bath tub.  Idk anything to escape from this life.

Spiritually abused in jail,"Laying on my bunk in the Brevard County jail the man in the bunk next to me started eating chips. I could hear him munching on them as I lay there trying to sleep.

19 and already my life is screwed ,"Hi, idk how to intro this but oh well. 
Let me be clear I’m not looking for any sympathy, trust me when I say that I messed up my life it was no one else so sympathy will get me no where, to be fair I just don’t have anyone in my life who’s actually willing to listen to me so here we are.

Firstly let me start out by saying that I am a Christian, have been for my whole life. For those that are still here thank you. Now that we’ve ripped that bandage off where to really start. 
I guess I could start with the fact that I am alone, totally alone. I have people, just not people who want to pour into me without getting a lot more in return. As it stands I can’t remember the last time I actually opened up about how sick I feel, not physically but mentally. 

I have 1 friend she’s really awesome, she’s my best friend, I love her to death but her parents hate me. They think I’m turning their daughter into a lesbian and we only really get to hang out for 1-2 hrs at a time every other week and since I started going to another church I barely see her anymore. I miss her a lot but she has her own issues and I know I have no right to be selfish, her issues are far worse then mine trust me I know that beyond a shadow of a doubt but sometimes it feels like we never really talk about my life. I’ve told her some stuff about me and to be fair she has sat with me when I cried on the phone with her but whenever we talk now she’s always complaining about her job and her family because they suck. I love her to death but sometimes I just let the phone ring until I feel bad enough to call her back because I don’t want to continue to hear about her problems when I feel like I’m suffocating from the inside out. I love her, I really do please believe me that I would die for this girl and I want her to be my maid of honor one day but I wish I could just talk to her about me, and she wouldn’t just shrug it off and then move onto her own issues. I need help and she’s my only friend but it feels like she doesn’t want to listen to me because she doesn’t know how to handle it when I have stuck my neck out for her a million times. I was there for her when her grandfather died and her dog got hit by a train, and I did her hair for her graduation twice and I have always always done my best to be there when she needed me. Not to mention due to her parents abhorrence of me we can’t ever see each other anymore and talking on the phone will never replace being with her in person. I know it sounds selfish but I’m not trying to be. With her parents hating me and causing her life to suck i feel like i can’t help anyways but i care for her so much i just want to get her out of the situation she’s in but I’m also suffering so I can’t really help her.

As I mentioned I stopped going to the church she went to. I left for a multitude of reasons, that church ruined my life although in the situation I wouldn’t blame them. My parents were both pretty prominent figures in that church before their reputation was smashed into the ground because of me, granted I was a child but If I hadn’t made the choice i made maybe I would’ve had a better life, it all stems from that place god if i could go back and tear that girl a new one i would but I can’t so whatever. Anyways all that crap happened, really traumatic stuff but that’s not what is happening presently it’s just to set up back story.
Presently i attend church with my parents but just a few months ago i was attending that other church. I liked it for a while, i met my friend there and we had a few fun trips and stuff but because of the incident i never had any other friends really. I had one other that was friends with me and my bsf but she ended up turning on us, it hurt my bsf more then me tbh but I caused that too, i started some stupid fight and the girl never really talked to us again. I had another friend but it turns out she was just using me to find out more about my life and the crap 10 years ago so she could feed it to the church gossip strip so i broke it off with her. Then i just had me and my bsf which was ok although i never saw her because she was working or just not going to church. I was alone, so i tried therapy with the pastor. At about that time my bsf stopped attending because of family stuff and i had a breakdown in the parking lot on new years, it was bad. I only went to a few sessions before i gave up on trying because it seemed like there was no help for someone like me.
I have been going to this new church (not new I’ve attended before but i was mentally unwell and still am) and it seems to be ok for now but I don’t really trust anyone, it was the same at the last church, i had no one, or i was shouldering everyone else as a burden. I’m just tired not physically but mentally , i have been for a loooooooooong time but when i tell anyone that they don’t get it at all. 

Another thing, I’ve graduated high school, it should be exciting but it’s not. (This is the part where i messed up my own life, pls do not feel bad for me about this particular thing lol) I’m a fraud so to speak, i attended regular school up till the beginning of highschool when I started to do homeschool. I got ok grades at the regular school and when i started to do homeschool i guess my parents just kinda thought i was cool to just do it by myself, not sure but i was given a laptop and cds to do and for the first year it was ok, i occasionally cheated but nothing serious, just looking up the really difficult questions on my phone or whatever. It was when i got to the end of 8th grade where i found the grade books my mom hid. I took them of course (stupid teenage brain riddled with depression) anyways i cheated my way through the rest of the grades like big time, I wasn’t learning anything at all. It was easy really, my parents took their hands off my education because they were busy with work and again i was alone. My dad had big dreams for me, still does, but i can only remember one time where he actually helped me do my school work and that was when i was still in regular school, but when i was homeschooled all he wanted was my report card. Good grades means good daughter i guess lol. Anyways i screwed up obviously. I graduated but i knew nothing and by the time i was in 11th grade i realized this but I couldn’t do anything but keep cheating to pass the grade so daddy dearest didn’t think anything weird. At some point my mom found out but she never told my dad and instead just helped me cheat by giving me the books (maybe she felt like i was just using them to grade myself or that she just couldn’t tell my dad because he is an angry individual anyways, he might just kill me if he found out lol.) 
I remember one time where i was in my room with headphones on “studying” and my mom tried knocking but she couldn’t get my attention so she came in and we smoothed it out but i guess my dad heard my mom knocking and decided to come to my room, slam the door open, yell at me as i cried and then pulled on the handle with his foot at the bottom of the door pulling the handle so much its still loose to this day. He asked me about it once and i told him the truth but he just said he didn’t remember. So anyways safe to say i have no one i can beg to help me with this and if i did i fear society would kill me to lol. Like i said don’t feel bad for me this is my own fault. 
He scares me, he can be happy one minute and the next he can snap at me or my mom like a rabid dog, i begged him to help me with my resume a million times since he was a supervisor at a medical facility but he just told me to do it and he’d look over it but he never did, so i just did it myself and nobody wants to hire me which is making him upset with me lol, he asks everyday if i found another job and that i should go to the places and stuff but I don’t want to even listen to him since he can’t take a second to just be a dad, i think he doesn’t want to be my dad. I don’t know why, or what i did maybe i remind him. Of himself with all my mental issues but i just wish i had someone to show me what to do now. Tbh i think my only solution is to take a bunch of pills and forget about this haha. Just end it all while i have some dignity left. No money, no friends, no life, I’m just so alone and there’s no magic solution so guess what, ill just return to my fathers throne, end it all , all the pain and hurt i inflicted upon myself then my dad can miss me when I’m gone. 

Anyways thanks for listening to my ramble and please don’t feel bad for me i did this to myself.

I know i can get into a good university but i just cant study. Im trying to do my best but i cant.  My mind doesn't allow me to.  

My tummy hurts because of crohns now. And i know theres a connection between gut and mental health. 

My situation now
:i wanna leave this house
:i dont have friends 
:i dont talk to anyone.  Im home all day. Trying to study. But i dont study
:i feel like a falier

All i want is to be nude in the nature, or get a hot bath or walk on a beach.  

But i cant do those because my exam is 4 months away.

Nothing is Fun Anymore,"I swear,  nothing will make me feel anything at this point. I feel like I'm just draining everyone around me; like I'm ruining everyone else's time. I have become Tweak from South Park; just quieter because I'm terrified of being loud and noticed.

I have no friends, I have no job because there is literally nothing I can see myself doing that won't mentally exhaust or siphon the life out of me.

I play video games all day so that my bad thoughts aren't as intense - but I fucking hate every second of it. I get zero pleasure. Victory Royales mean nothing; platinuming a Souls game means nothing... just repetition so my anxious thoughts don't get too out of whack.

Especially now that scumbag homeowners discovered Airbnb and that they can make more money nightly than renting to someone monthly.

Feeling awful,"I am reposting from r/breakups because I’m not even sure how appropriate it was for that sub.

We broke up on Monday after a year of a pretty terrible relationship. Constantly unmet needs and bare minimum requests unmet which triggered a lot of fights and nothing ever being done about it. He called me and told me I made him want to die and told me to fuck off and leave him alone. 

After a year and a half I finally quit my job that was exhausting me and leaving me feeling burnt out, most of the colleagues that I worked with in that time didn’t really care and some seemingly pointedly didn’t say goodbye on my last day. 

I don’t have many friends. Feel pretty insecure and like it’s difficult to connect with people but hang on to a sliver of hope that most of the time that’s something we tell ourselves out of insecurity. 

My family doesn’t ask anything about my life and treats me like a child, sent my mother a picture of my last day at work and she ignored it. Just feel like it would be easier if I was just dead. I feel so alone and like I’m not worth saving, like there’s no good part of me to hold on to. And to top it all off because I’m 26 I feel like I’m too old to be dealing with these immature/petty things or feelings. Feel like something is very wrong with me.

"I have no friends to ask for advice, vent to, laugh with, share hobbies with because I am just a shitty person.","I am 34f

I have not been able to hold onto a single friendship in so long. I really think that people just tolerate me at best.

I see people have extremely close friendships with people who share the same interests, have children around the same age, having a good time together, all that lovely stuff. But for the life of me I cannot hold onto a friendship.

Just to show a little self awareness of my flaws, I feel like I am never consistent as a person and can having changing opinions everyday(like how I feel about a coworker, controversial issues, my approaches to situations) I am very aware that I am all over the place. But I don't have bad intentions. I do my best to consider what would hurt others and what should or should not do/say. Sometimes my honesty is not appreciated, totally understandable. But does that make me so undesirable to be around?

Just as an extended example, I became friends through my work, since I work remote but even they avoid contact with me or keep it at a minimum.

I know that I got upset at each of these friends at one point because they have said something hurtful to me when I just try to barely exist around them. Also, if I have a moment of success I feel like they take it as a threat and make snide comments about how they are struggling with a task they have work as a response. They have had their successes too and I tell them good job let them know that they deserved the praise they get. They complain about their teams and I would listen to them and try to console them or try to give advice but they would ignore me or just would be dismissive in general. 

I even at one point was telling one of those friends that I really missed one of our old coworkers and was getting emotional about it and they said that I shouldn't care since this person didn't give a shit about me... later this person denied ever saying something like this when I brought it up months later.

I won't deny that recently I started saying snide stuff back because I have kinda had enough and just returned the attitude. But now that made it even worse between us.

I don't know what to do anymore but I know I complain about person A with person B and then person B will slowly just not want to talk to me anymore either. Like I have no one to confide it at all. I feel like if someone says/does something I am not allowed to talk about it cause then I am just the ball of negativity and no one wants to be around me. What do I do? I feel like there isn't a single soul out there that gives a shit about me.

Is it me? Like am I just a piece of shit? Am I just so fucking unlikeable?

Edit: To add about the hobbies, I hate competitiveness to my core. It makes me anxious and I don't like feeling that. But whenever I want to share a hobby why do I feel like people want to compete with that hobby? Kinda like my cooking is better than yours, playing games (in a team) but competing to show who is better in skill. I just want to have fun. I don't want to talk about whose is better. Maybe I am just sensitive. But I just want to share a hobby with someone that won't treat it as a competition",Positive-Ambition970,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1vqje/i_have_no_friends_to_ask_for_advice_vent_to_laugh/

i just want happiness ,"do you ever think back to a time when you were happy? i do all the fucking time, it hurts so much to exist now

when my mother took care of me and took me everywhere to make me happy

when i had a loving girlfriend who promised me a bright future, a marriage, children, a life worth living and working for

when i was passing school with the highest grades and honors, energy in me to do my best and work to my career

slowly losing everything, watching your life collapse in front of you, and you sit there, with no control, and all you can do is cry

i now take care of my mother who isn’t as well now with constant medications, cries in front of me, and worsens every year

my girlfriend broke up with me 4 months ago (been together for half a decade) because she couldn’t do long distance anymore, told me she doesn’t have enough love for me, and doesn’t want to see me

and now im barely passing college, failed a class, lost a scholarship, and i don’t give a fuck about graduating or any career

i lost everything, i have constant nightmares of my girlfriend leaving me, i loved her more than anything in the world and she meant everything to me, she was my hope to a happier life

i’ve been crying everyday for months, often research suicide and read posts on reddit about them, i tried everything to get better (gym, hang out with friends, hobbies, every fucking thing) and nothing works, i feel worse

im afraid of being alone and i know ill have no one left soon, the only reason why im still here is because i dont want to hurt my mother more than she already is if i were to disappear

sometimes i feel like screaming, i hate that i have no control over my life anymore, i cant do anything, all i can do is sit and wait until i lose the last few people i have left

i wish i could just disappear, i dont wanna cry anymore, i dont wanna have tormenting thoughts anymore, i dont want nightmares anymore, i wish i could be happy

i just wanted to vent, i have no one to tell my feelings and thoughts to, i pretend to be okay, i wish i was happy ",JohnAlks12,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e205p4/i_just_want_happiness/
Sorry mom,"I lost my twin brother when we were 7. It’s been  12 years now! After my sweet brother left this earth, I have had this urge to leave too.

My father used to say that when one twin d!es the other shall follow. I’m not sure if that is true anymore, but surely he must be right, since I have not truly smiled since I lost him.

 I can’t explain the type of grief I feel anymore.
Every birthday is a reminder of my loss and I feel guilty. I feel guilty for growing up!

I feel like he would have loved living, he would have loved growing up instead my parents lost their son and got stuck with a bipolar daughter.
Since I look identical to him all these years my mother couldn’t even look at me without crying.

She used to make me dress into his clothes when she would miss him asking me to tell her that he was okay. I haven’t existed since I lost him. I didn’t realise how much he protected me all these years and he even passed away protecting me. I feel guilty for how my mind is! 

If I could, I would change places with him; I want to change places with him. I feel like a ghost that stole another persons’ lifepath.

I had a best friend she was always there for me. She understood me and never made me feel like I needed to be someone else. I loved her existence everything about her was beautiful. I moved away and she passed at 15! 

It’s been 4 years now. I feel jealous of them, I know how messed up that is but I feel jealous. I miss her!

I have trouble keeping friends now (terrified if I am a curse) and maintaining relationships. I had someone in my life who loved me for me but of course even he got scared when I got into a depressive episode for the first time.

What’s the point anymore!? I am 19 years old and the thought of having to exist for another decate sounds dreadful enough. 

I love my mother! There is nothing that I want more than to see her smile but I can’t be here for her anymore.

I don't know what I'm supposed to do.,"I'm 17, from Turkey and I just dont know what will make me happy. I have a roof atop my head, a cozy bed and food and water. If I say I was sad it would be shameful wouldnt it? Millions of people over the world are much poorer than I am, they are in the middle of wars they don't even have anything to do with, many people have shitty parents, live in shitty places, have no friends, are oppressed, yet they still try holding on to life, they still work hard to live and stay alive. They try brushing off their problems and continue their lives.

And we have me, complaining about some bullshit. Do I even have the right to complain? I should be disgusted at myself for even thinking of a possibilty of suicide. How can I do that while there are millions who are in worse conditions than me right? And my parents, they have fed me and took care of me for my whole life and going away without returning anything would be disrespectful to them right? Or is it already their fault for bringing me to this world. Maybe I shouldnt feel indebted to them because they wanted to make another child because of their selfishness and them wanting another kid and nobody asked me my opinion about being born. So they are supposed to take care of me and feed me, because they themselves wanted to make a child so its their duty to do so right? I honestly don't know which one I should feel. I guess my brother wasnt enough for them though, I know that at least.

I have lots of friends, they are all good people, but not even a SINGLE one of them will accept me for who I really am. I don't even know what I am by the way. I am certain of a few things though. I was born into a male body. I know that I like my hair long, and I like having bangs, I like learning about makeup, I like feminine clothing, I know that I hate my masculine body, I hate my body hair, I hate my thick eyebrows that most of my guy friends envy, I hate that I'm as tall as I am, and I know that I feel that something just isn't right. Am I trans? I don't know, maybe I am. But who cares about the labels, I just know that I want to live the way I want to. My friends though? They aren't willing to accept me. No way am I EVER going to open up. Most of my friends are Muslims, even those that aren't, they hate everything related to lgbtq+. I was an hypocrite when one of my closest friends was proudly talking to me about burning a rainbow flag in the street. and I laughed at it. I have no place in the lgbtq+ community because I am not proud about who I am. I can't proudly defend my real thoughts, and I'm supposed to live up to my father and friends' expectations of being some big muscular dominant male or some shit. It's been 13 months since I started going to the gym. I'm stronger than most of those friends. They respect me. But what if they knew that deep down I wanted to keep my hair down, and learn more about makeup? Why do they care even? It's my body isn't it.

Hormone therapy? Maybe hitting up a psychologist? Or a therapist? I don't know how to. I don't know about any of these things. I know that I am not opening up to my parents about any of this. Forget gender, but I am not even saying a single word about having symptoms of clinical depression. I was the hypocrite who laughed and agreed with my father when he proclaimed that depression is some bullshit created by the west to disrupt our progression. I thought my brother was more sane. He says that Turkey is a country bound by its customs and religion. He says that he supports lgbtq+, religious freedom, he says he wants to change how the country is. Yesterday, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. I got tired of hating myself and suddenly losing all joy whenever I looked at my reflection, in the phone, in the mirror, wherever and whatever. I watched some videos, grabbed a scissor, and cut some tall bangs to cover my large forehead and my receding hairline (at this age, I know). I got out of the bathroom, my brother saw me, he started laughing. ""What, u transitioning or something?"" ""You look like a girl, its awful."". Yeah, they are all supportive of modernising or whatever unless it comes to someone they know. My mother is probably like that also. I am not gonna open up to anyone I know, like, ever.

One of my friends saw my hair. He said that he fucking hated it. He said that he would pay for my haircut and he said that he was gonna arrange a barber next week. What about my opinion? You haven't asked me? He said that I hadn't had a relationship ever, and with hair like that, I wouldn't ever get one either. Who cares? I don't cut my hair, I don't look after myself, I don't go to the gym and build a body just to get in some fake relationship that's all about looks. And this guy had long hair for years mind you. Now that a few months ago he was clean shaven, he somehow turned into a guy who hates long hair? ""Friends"" right. I like his company nevertheless. Some other friend saw me. He would oftenly joke about how I would look great in feminine clothing, and that I should ""open an onlyfans"". Hilarious jokes I know, I never found them funny. He hated the hair the most. He angrily said that I should hide that shitty hair. I thought you were with me though? You joked about feminine clothing because of my long hair but if I was to actually wear a skirt, I believe you would get me out of your life and hate me. I sent a friend whom I opened up about these feelings I had a photo. He said I was mentally ill. He assumed that I was ""turned to normal"" after I started hitting the gym. Well, the one dude who I thought would help me throughout this was also turned against me now. Really good being alone. Sure I got friends, but in reality I don't have ANYONE whom I can talk about my real feelings. Oh yea, I also had that one dude. He ""was"" pansexual. He used to help me, but he said that he turned into a Muslim and he was only a pansexual because he was a kid. He was ""normal"" now, he said. He used to preach us about loving everyone because he watched vinland saga (an anime about basically having no enemies). One time we were talking, he said that he was homophobic. I asked, you used to say that you hated no people, and what about gay people then? They can't control who they love or not? He said that he didn't consider them as ""people"" to begin with. So yeah, I am, in fact, alone in reality.

Maybe I should just buzzcut my hair. My hair is the only thing that binds me to my true self I feel like. If I cut my hair, would I forget about the gender dysmorphia and become a true man? Or will the dysmorphia kill me and I would be even more depressed and would hate myself even more? My friends would like me more that's for sure. But it's not worth it. Maybe it is, I don't know. I don't have the balls to take such a leap anyway.

Next year, I'm going to have an exam. That single exam basically singlehandedly decides which college we will be going to in Turkey. All our lives, bound by 1 single exam. I want to be an artist. I aim for graphic design in a good college here. I won't be able to do it though. The stress started hitting me already. I have only a year, so many people are ahead of me. People who go to courses, have lessons about art. I am here with only my self-made talent. I am supposed to work without sleep on art for an exam a year later. I hate it. I really enjoy drawing, but the whole year will be a nightmare. An older friend of mine. He committed suicide because of this exam. The pressure was too much for him. (There's no suicide hotline in Turkey btw, as a side note) My brother took the exam a few years ago. His routine was waking up 6 am, 2 hours of studying, 8 am to 4 pm was school, 4 pm to 8 pm was cram school. 8 pm to 10 pm was studying and he slept after. This was his routine for a WHOLE YEAR. He got into the college he wanted, he also finished grade as the top of the school. I know that I don't have this in me. I can't study this much, even if it's drawing. My father just barely agreed with me after weeks of arguments that he would allow me to go to art school. If I can't get in this year, I'm fucked.

I feel like an entitled brat. I've seen the posts here. People are going through so much worse things than me. I'm an asshole to even have suicidal thoughts right? I tried self harming today. I grabbed some knife, cut through my thigh. It hurt, there was blood. I felt nothing after it. I don't know what I was expecting. Maybe I just gaslit myself into depression? Whatever, I am not doing that again. I don't know what I'm expecting posting this here. If there is a karma limit its all for nothing anyway. If there isn't , I would most likely get a few responses anyway. I know I wouldn't read through this bullshit block of text. Venting feels good sometimes though. I don't know. I don't know what I should do. I have much more to write, but who cares anyway. I don't even care enough to write them down myself.

I fear my depression will be the end of my marriage,"TL:DR: I think my depression is seen as an inconvenience to husband and I’m constantly scared he will leave me if I’m not happy wife facade 

TW: sibling loss, suicide

Me (28F) and my husband (30M) have been married for seven years. A lot happens in that time. Good, bad, ugly. Overall I feel our relationship is straight out of a love story. There’s always going to be bumps in relationships but we’ve always been able to eventually communicate and fix anything that’s not quite working 

Well last year, I lost a sibling unexpectedly to suicide. Not sure how many people have experienced grief on top of regular ole depression but suffice it to say it has been rough. A rollercoaster of emotions and everyday being different. I feel we’ve navigated it as best we could and overall my husband has been supportive. 

Lately my own depression has gotten very bad. Like not leave my bed, loss of appetite bad. And I feel my husband doesn’t understand. I don’t feel like I’m given any grace during this time period. And I really don’t think he does it from a malicious place I just don’t think he understands severe mental health issues or how best to support someone. Which I get. I don’t expect him to be my therapist. But I do expect him to be a support system for me and I just don’t feel that. 

I don’t know if I’m just in my own head or what but it really feels like my depressive episodes are inconveniences to him. For example, past 48 hours have been awful. Something not done by either of us pushed me over the edge and every feeling came spilling out. Including how dark my thoughts are right now. I mean very concerning thoughts. I think it caught him off guard and I just went to bed. Today we tried to watch tv and I dragged myself out of bed to do so. I was snort laughing which happens sometimes and it felt so good to feel the little glimpses of joy that are so rare. He told me to stop because the sound was stressing me out. Knowing and seeing that I hadn’t smiled in two fucking days. 

I blew up at him and he tried to backtrack by saying he thought I was choking or something (obvious lie and doesn’t want to own up) 

And it just got me thinking about how I don’t feel like I can turn to him to support. And that my mental health will always be an annoyance to him. And I’m so scared he will leave me if I let myself fall to deep into these feelings. 

Idk what to do. I can’t imagine life without him I love him more than anything. but I’m finding myself even more depressed over the fact that I’m basically alone in this struggle. 

How do I have a successful relationship with someone when I’m in such a dark place. What can I tell him to do to be supportive. Idk how to navigate this 

FWIW, I am medicated and try to do a lot of things at home to keep my mental health good. haven’t gone to therapy as I moved states and finding a new one sucks.

coming up on 20 solid years of unrelenting depression ,"i’m turning 31 very soon and it’s really starting to sink in that my depression is almost of legal drinking age. 
when i try to explain to most people that it’s not just being sad sometimes, it doesn’t go away, talking doesn’t help much, etc, it’s always the same reactions: “well it’ll go away” “when X changes, then you’ll feel better” “you just have to get through this bout”. how do you really explain to someone that you’ve wanted to die every single day (sans not a single day) since i was 11 years old. it seems unfathomable for most people which leads me to believe i might be actually crazy. 
it is very strange to me that i don’t know anyone else in my personal life who seems to struggle as intensely as myself and with as many frequent suicidal thoughts. 
it doesn’t seem to matter what is happening in my life, where my career is headed, how many friends i think i have.. the sum of all the parts still seems to equal zero.

is my trauma valid?,"
Hello, im a 17 years old girl with lots of trauma. For context my mom (40f) and my dad (38m) have their own traumas which are connected with their own parents. half of my family has mental issues and alcoholism. anyway, lets go to my story, when i was 7, i went to 1st grade of elementary school (im from Europe, i will not say what country). My dad picked his 10 hour long work, yes he’s working 10h per day. Im seeing him maybe 10 min per day for 10 years now. My dad is abusive emotionally towards me and sometimes my mom. For example, on my 14 bday he told me that he hates me and he never loved me cuz i didn’t went to school that day. And he’s always yelling at me that he spends money on my therapist, psychiatrist and meds. he hates the fact that i have LOTS of mental illnesses. Also i was bullied my WHOLE life in school, thats why i have my school online now. Plus, im not basic AT ALL from my appearance, and he’s always laughing at me how ugly i am. When i was a kid and i wanted his help he was yelling at me and telling me how stupid i am. Thats why when i was 11 years old i started sh and i was suicidal, and nothing changed to this day. On the other hand, my mom is drinking so much and she has alcohol issues. And she’s always yelling at me that its not true that she has issues with alcohol. Plus, shes never protecting me from my dad. For example, yesterday i came home crying cuz people were laughing at me on the street cuz of my looks and overall im extremely suicidal since 1 month. (i had suicide attempt 2 years ago and i want to repeat it) And my mom was complaining at me that im weak. Plus she told me that she have REAL trauma and problems and she’ll die cuz of me. Plus she’s always yelling at me that she’ll close me in mental asylum. honestly? i have nobody. my grandma which i was extremely close with died 4 years ago, she was only 52 years old. i have enough. i want to kms. and i feel like my parents are right. Is my trauma valid or i am overreacting? (obviously they’re examples cuz worse things happened with my parents)

I refused to do any tests because it involved having to be watched via video chat, my heart raced and I became dizzy even thinking about having to feel the gaze of someone else on me, the awkward silence, and so this became my typical reaction to any anxiety provoking thoughts or situations.

It really never ends,"Just when I thought I had gotten better I get down to my lowest.

I recently started exercising again but the days where I really struggle I just can't bring myself to do anything but lay around and get drunk, its really the only time life feels bearable. 

Something a lot of people don't talk about is how hard it is to maintain or gain new relationships as an adult. Slowly all my friends have begun to drift apart not always for bad reasons but just the paths life takes you. There's probably two or three people I could really consider a friend but they don't live close and live busy lives so its hard to talk or see them regularly. I tried dating but I had so many bad experiences I just don't wanna subject myself to that torture anymore. 

I wouldn't consider myself suicidal anymore but the loneliness has really begun to eat me up. Some days I'm alright but other days it feels like I'm hanging on by a thread.

Idk I’m sure I’ll live to 105 and struggle every day until then. I just don’t know where to turn from here. I can’t gain traction in life and even when I do, I eventually fuck it all up. The even crazier thing is I like to see others do well. Anyone. I’m kind, polite, generous. I smile at strangers. I fake happiness in fear of making someone else sad. I daydream about having just a normal life and good people in my life. It’s getting to the point of being so deep in a dark hole idk how I’ll ever get out… ",deerocckk,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e26nlw/whats_wrong_with_me/
GenX ennui.,"I'm 51. The first half of my life was the ""old world."" Four TV channels, newspapers, home phone, being young. Life fully ahead of me. The second half has been the modern world. Internet, cell phones, social media, middle age, work, the trappings of a semi-middle class lifestyle. More and more I just miss my younger life and the family I've lost since then. I haven't felt truly alive for probably 20 years. My life now feels like it's preoccupied by narrowly avoiding an endless stream of existential crises. Rinse and repeat. I think I am not equipped to endure middle age. I go through this crisis 2 or 3 times a week now so I know I'm depressed.

"Sleeping all day, exhaustion and loss of desire to do anything ","I am 29m living alone, no social support, with severe depression, PTSD, ADHD, anxiety and severe depression. I have been sleeping for 15 hours a day and wake up very exhausted without the desire to do anything even watching new things on my phone. I am isolating myself for the last 3 weeks at home.

I do therapy once a week and on 5 medications. I feel like nothing is working. The therapist and commenters on other posts I made told me to basically ""keep going on, you are strong and you will make it and be happy"". I tried forcing myself to do all possible activities from watching movies and gaming, to meeting new people and going out.

A misunderstanding that took me downhill,"Hey there friends. Idk where should i really put this, but i really need to vent out to somebody at 1 am in the morning, a heavy heart pounding that keeps getting louder as time progress , staring aimlessly at the dark ceiling of my room, listening to the constant crickets and he distant barks through the window. I'm an 18M, and would probably be graduating in due time. I have antisocial and have an extreme anxiety as of late, and i have been depressed for nearly 6 months now. Ever since then, my life has been a constant downhill, and it looks like that it wouldn't be stopping. To the eyes of someone not close to me, I appear to be content with life and being able to help people in any way i can. Now, I just don't know anymore.

There are certainly a number of factors in why I have been depressed. But i want to discuss right now is what would eventually turn into losing of my closest friends. I have a feeling that in due time i will be losing all of my best friends, and it will be because of all of my wrongdoings. On our friend group, I was unknowingly making offensive jokes, thinking that it was that on that stage of being friends where we could tell some jokes and would just laugh it off. Without me knowing until recently, I have actually been offending one of my female friends that we would call ""Jewel"" for the time being
















It all started about 10 months ago, i was just starting a sense of depression feels like. Ever since grade school, I haven't made the one that i can truly call a friend since I have been switching schools every 3 years. When I went to my 11th grade, I only have 1 goal: to have tons of friends whom i could bond with even if we go separate ways to our dream colleges and future careers (ik my goal is a bit cliche but stay with me on this one). On the 1st month, I have met my future best friend, that for the sake of anonymity, we will call him ""Alan."" Alan was like the brother I never had. We had a lot of a common interest, and would be even be not exaggerating to call it too much. From the shows we watch, the games we play, hell even our music taste are the same! I couldn't have asked for a better friend like him.

Back to the topic at hand, at the height of my depression, Alan was the first one I have reached out to talk about it. I was really anxious and scared on what to tell him because this would be my first time opening up to someone. In the end, Alan comforted me on one of my toughest times and said to me that he'll be always avaliable.

Depressed parents ,"Growing up, I never witnessed my parents having fun or generally not be depressed for one time, Home was always a sad place to be and it still is. It might sound crazy but it felt like my parents had based their life on their own miserable principle that life has to be hard and sad in order to be right! Like, they preferred to be sad because they had this crazy belief that they could achieve more success by isolating themselves and only focusing on work and absolutely nothing else. I can't remember a single day that they didn't argue or had fun. Even when they did actually tried to have fun there must had been a strong reasoning behind it. They were also overprotective and never allowed me to have a normal childhood to develop social skills and such. Their behavior had such a deep impact on me that I'm still trying to recover from. The only thing that worries me the most is how they're making my brother's life hell just like they did to me but I can't find a way to help him and I feel very guilty because of this.

My electrical meatball is malfunctioning again,"I was wondering if anyone had a similar experience to me. Does it get better? What helped you through the seemingly downward spiral? 

A few background things: I stopped taking my medication at the end of May. I stopped cold turkey (I know I shouldn't have, but I didn't want to stop during the school year as a teacher and deal with withdrawal symptoms). My doctor had me on 20mg Lexapro for a year and a half. I was also on 150 mg of Welbutrin for a time to curb side effects, but I stopped that way before May. Part of the reason I stopped both is because I kept forgetting to take them regularly, anyway. 

The first week or so, I was just irritated and felt kind of nauseous. I felt fine for the next 2-3 weeks and slowly, my depression symptoms have been creeping back in.

I am now at the point where I have a hard time even mustering up enough energy to eat something for most of the day, even when I'm hungry. I can't get anything done around the house unless I break into my reserve energy vault that leaves me exhausted. I really could sleep all day, every single day. I'm just so overwhelmed and have no real coping strategies to rely on at this point because getting out of bed or off the couch is so, so difficult.

I didn’t finish my studies and am currently laid off from my job. I have been a marketing specialist since 2016. For the first part of my career, everything was going well, but after 2022, my career went downhill. Now, everyone around the world wants to be a freelancer, and I’m having a hard time finding a decent job.

Ready to throw in the towel.,"I've always struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. If I mention therapy or drugs in front of my family, they look at me like I should be locked away.

Some days I feel like I should be. I've always been shy and introverted, but smart enough to recognize the signs that there are definitely issues going on. I can see the issues right in front of me, and yet I still spiral and self-destruct.

I've ruined every relationship I've had due to cheating and insecurities of feeling both inadequate and better than my partner. I recognize there is probably some underlying narcissism and potentially more issues than I can recognize. 

I never quite fit in anywhere, and I never felt like I belonged anywhere. Wherever I am I feel out of place. I feel like I'm just a spectator, not a participant in life. And the more I try to change, the more parts of me push back harder. 

I feel like I get used by people easily. ""Friends"" ask for money and I'm just so happy to have someone to talk to for 5 minutes I oblige. Then I get angry after the fact, flip out, and alienate more people from my life. 

I don't trust anybody anymore. Part of that is me projecting myself onto others; part of it is rooted in being fucked over too many times. 

I hate the way I look. I hate the way I think. And I hate the way I feel. Most of the time there's no joy in my life. The things that used to make me happy no longer do.

Depression rotting my brain,"For background, I've been depressed for nearly 10-12 years now. I'm writing this because I came across a study with how depression can affect the brain. I don't believe I'm a lost cause although it constantly feels that way because of my habits, lack of motivation and brain.

It feels like a everyday battle with myself and my feelings. I don't feel sad rather disappointed and conflicted of my life- when that fails I feel empty. I am creative, I have always been creative so I constantly come with ideas but I get burnt out so easily. One day I feel so energetic before I fall back into the cycle of sleeping for days, not bothering to do anything. I feel like wasted potential because I know I can do better and I have in later years. Sometimes when I do feel motivated, my mind goes blank and I struggle to remember or physically do anything.

In the study, it showed how depression can cause memory loss, struggles with social abilities and also academic knowledge aswell. I don't believe my depression is at its peak but it's definitely gotten worse mentally, the only difference I can tell is in late years- I was more social and had a strict schedule to follow due to school, events and friends which forced me to get out. In recent years, I don't go out at all or speak to anyone. Normally, I rot away on social media or I'm social in my online presence by playing video games. I don't study anything, after HS I didn't know what do to in college (it's only been a few years after hitting 18). Studying and good grades were pressured on me negatively, causing me to lose any interest in school.

I can tell there's something wrong with my head, my mind feels so blurry like I can't focus. I can't find motivation to do anything, I feel very numb and lost. I can barely spell anymore without auto correct on my phone, same with keeping up with clean handwriting. My memory is like a Goldfish, sometimes I can remember the day before or even what I've done the current day when speaking to my partner. I can feel that I've gotten almost stupider and that my brain is just literally loosing braincells. It's a repeating cycle that i wish to stop, i was so smart before- i could spell most words, i would dedicate myself to art n ideas, i would even get out more. I know and need to make a change so I can get better for my future. At the moment, therapy isn't a option for me and same with medicine but here's what I've added to my daily life.

1. Green tea, it's simple but it's the very start of my routine. It's a ""beginning"" but also has benefits
2. Healthy meals, I stopped buying processed food and instant. I buy minimum items but I try to stick to fresh things like fruit, veggies and nuts. Although i still have trouble finding motivation to get up and cook.
3. Sleeping early, this is hard considering I have Insomnia but I find myself the most productive when I accept that I can't stay up all night- there will always be another day for me to do more.
4. Lists, lists seem to help me alot. I normally list items I need to buy for self-care and budget
5. Walking, as of now- I don't walk due to it feeling like hell outside but it was refreshing to do. Exercise is helpful
6. Showering, finding motivation to shower can be hard when you're laying in bed but I use this as a point to try to start my day and feel more awake.

I'm unsure if these things will 100% help me considering depression has affected me for years now but it's a start, this isn't advice for anyone but if you feel like it can be beneficial to you then go for it. After reading the study, i heard practicing things such as quick math, writing and grammar helped people.

"I got used to live with depression, but after a bit of happiness idk if i will get used to emptiness again","From the age of 13 when my dad died until a few months ago(im 23 now) I had the mindset that I didn't need to be happy to survive. (""Im not a good person if I complain about my sadness when there is more suffering out there"").

I experienced bullying in school, lacked money, and had no desire to do anything outside of my home. Also, I felt inferior to others. Throughout high school, I never hung out with friends, and my only distractions were video games and music. 

When I entered university, my social anxiety improved, but I still lacked the desire to connect with people or pursue hobbies. I completed my degree and only went out with friends once during that time.

Despite this, I forced myself to engage in normal hobbies, watch movies and series, and participate in sports. I didn't want to appear as the odd one who had no interests or conversation topics. Happiness wasn't a priority; my goal was to have a decent professional career and support my family, I wanted the people next to me to be happy even if I wasnt.

However, fate intervened this year when I met a woman on a dating app who showed genuine interest in me just as I am. We shared everything in common, and our three-month relationship made me feel alive, not just existing. Unfortunately, she ended things and returned to her ex. I feel so empty now.

I know normal people would just get another gf, but I feel every single human is unique, and if wasnt her, Im sure I wouldnt ever have a relationship.

I have no complaints about the people around me or my job. People are generally kind, and I reciprocate that kindness. However, I lack motivation to do anything. I just keep doing what I have to do. My willpower exists solely to avoid disappointing others. I exercise and eat healthily for physical well-being, and I try to be sociable. 

I have no goals, no enjoyment in anything, no hobbies, no desire to travel, or acquire material possessions, or meet other women. I even stopped playing videogames, guitar and piano.

Yet, I can't contemplate ending my life because I want to continue supporting my family. I cant let my family become sad because of my death, and I really fear death myself, so I am afraid I am unable to get used to live a sad life again.

Wondering about apathy ,"Hello everyone.

I'm 27 years old, and I've been dealing with depression since 11 I think. I am diagnosed, but the diagnosis came when I was like 20 or so.

On my daily life I don't have a lot of struggles I'd say, nor do I have any suicidal thoughts (never had). I can't really cry either, the last time was years and years ago, spontaneously while hugging my sister.

Anyways, I decided to make this post because I have a question. I feel like I have a severe case of apathy. I don't care about almost anything except of my family, I have no desires, basically no plans for the future. I'm just existing, like I'm on some kind of limbo.

It feels awful but at the same time it feels like... The thought of going back to being healthy (although I don't remember how that was) sounds false. It sounds like a lie.

Switching from Zoloft to Lexapro to Wellbutrin,"Hello, I (21F) had my first experience with antidepressants in the form of (25mg for 2 weeks then 50mg) Zoloft beginning 5/3/24. A month later, I switched to 10mg Lexapro cold turkey due to my provider’s recommendation because I wasn’t feeling better. Another month later 6/4/24, a new doc suggested I switch to 150mg Wellbutrin cold turkey 7/9/24 since I didn’t feel much different on Lexapro either. This doc said since I didn’t have any withdrawal symptoms cold turkeying from Zoloft to Lexapro I should be fine doing the same Lexapro to Wellbutrin. Today is my fourth day of being on Wellbutrin and I can positively say I feel significantly worse. I’m not sure if it’s symptoms of withdrawal or the Wellbutrin. I feel moody like when I PMS (sad, extreme loneliness) but on top of that I feel empty/hopeless in moments I’m alone. It’s making me anxious. I also feel like I’m withdrawing myself from social situations which is odd because I am someone who craves company 24/7 as a result of abandonment issues. Can anyone else relate? Also, after studying several Reddit posts I feel as though I didn’t give Lexapro enough time? Many people have said they didn’t begin to feel better until 6-8 weeks in.

Depression and the feeling of being numb…,"I don’t post normally but I need a way to get my feelings out other than say Facebook or things such as that. 

Here’s my story…. Grab a seat and a snack and be ready for this. None of it is good. 

I’ve been dealing with mental health all my life. I was 5 when I was diagnosed with bipolar, adhd, autism, anger issues and disgraphia. I’ve been living a shadow of a life ever since. 

My family wanted me to get counseling because of my several attempts of killing myself or saying I would as a kid. I’ve white knuckled my way through life. I’m 23 now and I don’t look like it nor do I act like it. I’m old for someone my age. 

For instance I like jazz and things most people my age don’t. 
Just out of place. 

Depression didn’t really start until I got a little older. It was after high school when I really started to notice that I just don’t care anymore. Living off of impulse and do what I want. Screw everyone else. I’m just so tired of doing that all the time. I’ve been put on medication that almost killed me several times. I’ve had to change psychiatrists several times because of this. 

I know I’m not the only one but I’m definitely one of a few. I’m out of place and out of time. I don’t want to kill myself but I’m not opposed to anything or anyone doing it. I’m just done with everything you know? 

I can’t talk to my family anymore about it. I live in my own and have burned all the bridges in my family. I’ve had what most have not. Help. And I just threw it away because it wasn’t the help that I needed. 

Here is a little context for you. 

When I was 3 my mother and father got divorced. Ever since I’ve been under the same conclusion. It’s my fault. Because I’m different than my entire family. 
My grandfather who was like a father to me, passed away november 22 2018. I graduated 2019. I’ve never felt more defeated in all my life until he was taken from me. I’ve always had a want to help others. After he died, so did I… I’m not ok in the slightest and I know that. But what is stupid is that I’m comfortable in my depression but at the same time I’m tired of it. The main reason I don’t change is because I’m numb. 
It’s not a matter of not wanting to, it’s a matter of feeling worthless and unwanted but at the same time loved and wanted. These are mixed signals as clear as the sky is blue. 
This has been an issue since I was little. 

I’m different and I don’t trust anyone anymore. I’m just fed up of trying. 

I’m also flirtatious by nature. I try not to be but my mouth gets me into trouble. I tell my self one thing and do the opposite. I’ve lost several jobs this way. I want to go mute because of this. 

I’ve host lost all hope by this point that I can change and that I should even try. Maybe this is my fate to be the super villain of my story. I don’t know. I just don’t know… I’m not even tired anymore. I just don’t care and don’t want to do anything. I’ve just lost my will and want to live because what’s the point. My family and friends all tell me I have this great potential but I’ve never seen it myself. I won’t kill my self but if someone else does it, by all means go for it. I know my family and friends love me but I don’t love myself. I’ve hated myself since the day I learned the word.

Dépressif ou déprimé ?,"Tout d’abord désolé si il y a des erreurs mais c’est mon premier post. J’ai 19 ans et depuis le collège j’ai toujours eu une sorte de mal être en moi. J’ai fini par accepter qu’à ce moment là je me donnais cette image de moi car je trouvais ça un peu ""stylé"". Mais bon j’avais déjà le sentiment de vivre pour autrui (mes parents) et non à 100% pour moi-même. Ma période lycée on va dire que ça s’est accentué, c’était plus juste pour les caméras. J’ai vécu une longue relation dans laquelle j’me considérais heureux mais j’étais totalement tombé dans de la dépendance affective. (Avec du recul les moments où je me sens épanouis ne dépendent pas vraiment de moi mes des autres). Mon bonheur dépendait énormément de ses actions, pensées ou encore sa présence. A cette période je me sentais déjà très seul. J’avais certes des potes mais très peu que je considérais comme grand ami. Au côté de ce groupe de pote je me sentais seul en étant accompagné et même si ça va un peu mieux aujourd’hui je ne me suis pas vraiment fait d’autres potes depuis. Il y avait beaucoup de moments où je parlais sans être écouté/entendu malgré mes efforts. Pour d’autres raisons également j’avais décidé de concentrer toute mon attention envers ma copine de l’époque qui a fini par me quitter il y a 1 an. J’ai donc ressenti l’impression d’avoir perdu à la fois ma copine, ma meilleure amie et tout mon entourage non familial. Cette année fut témoin d’une énorme remise en question et réflexion sur moi même. Je ne me suis jamais senti seul et triste de toute ma vie. Pourtant il y a pire j’ai une famille, des personnes sur qui compter, je peux manger à ma faim mais je ne sais pas il manque un truc. J’ai également 0 but dans la vie, je ne sais pas quoi faire comme métier et j’ai vraiment peur du futur car je m’intéresse à très peu de choses. J’ai d’ailleurs tendances à trop vouloir rester dans ma zone de conforts. Par exemple pour jouer ou regarder des films ou séries je préfère souvent revoir ou rejouer aux mêmes jeux/films. Depuis mon enfance je crains énormément la mort de mes parents car je sais que ce sera peut être le début de la fin pour moi. C’est d’ailleurs la seule raison concrète qui me déchire et me fait pleurer de temps à autre. Récemment j’ai vécu un peu + d’1 mois en étant dans un vrai mood Good vibe mais je sens clairement une rechute depuis plusieurs jours. Pourtant je suis dans une période où je ne suis jamais sorti autant avec des potes si fréquemment de toute ma vie. Après une fois chez moi je passe plus de 80% du temps dans mon lit sur mon phone.
Un truc qui me fait remettre en question mon état est le fait que j’ai beaucoup + souvent envie de disparaître et non de mourir. Car je sais qu’il y a quand même des bons moments à passer et mourir entraînerait la tristesse de mon entourage et que j’aurai des regrets. Je n’ai jamais fait de TS, scarification ou autres. Les seuls trucs ""bêtes"" de ce genre que j’ai fait sont de boire ou fumer comme un golmon en soirée.
En bref j’aimerai savoir si je vis une dépression ou si je suis déprimé. J’ai déjà vu un psy et infirmiers mais cela ne s’est pas bien passé car c’était tout le temps moi qui parlait et n’avait aucune réponse à mes questions. Pour vous aiguiller voici les symptômes que j’ai + ou - selon les périodes : 

-Tristesse
-Solitude/Isolement volontaire ou non 
-Petit ou fort appétit 
-Fatigue quotidienne
-Mauvais rythme et peu de sommeil
-Idées suicidaires
-Peur et désespoirs de l’avenir 
-Fort pessimisme 
-Problèmes de concentrations et d’attentions
-Manque de confiance en soi
-Perte ou peu d’intérêts pour les choses
-Addictions aux écrans
-Je garde de + en + mes problèmes pour moi

Time is up,"I have a good life on paper.   I'm educated, have a good job, good friends, and a good family.  The problem is that I am 47 years old and can't seem to find a lasting relationship. I'm also not very attractive.  I meet women who swear up and down that they love me and want to grow old with me.  I think they fall in love with me because I make them laugh, and I'm good in bed. Things are usually good for a while, and then they leave.  I have been dumped twice via text by live in partners.   Recently, I got engaged, and now my fiancee is unsure about the relationship.   She took her ring off.  We had some stressors in our relationship. She wouldn't talk to me about it, and instead, gave me the silent treatment.  I talked to one of my friends about it because I needed an ear and advice.  I needed some comfort and to figure out how to fix things.    This angered my fiancee.  She didn't appreciate me airing our dirty laundry to someone else, which is a fair complaint.   I should have kept my feelings to myself.  Anyway, it appears I have failed at yet another relationship because she requested I keep my distance from her, and I have.  I've mostly isolated myself in one of our bedrooms, only emerging to walk the dog or go to work.  I have not engaged in conversation or even initiated any text messages.  The last time we had an actual conversation she told me she feels I don't listen to her.  I waited until she was done talking and summarized what she said.  I even asked if my summary was correct. She said it was.  Later on she texted me saying she is taking her ring off because she is unsure about the relationship.  I really thought I had gotten things right this time.  The biggest problem is that there's a child involved, and I love him too.  I have been a step mom to him for nearly 2 years. The thought of losing both of them is devastating.  I get it, though.  I'm just not good enough of a person to deserve love. It feels like I'm unworthy. I feel despondent. I haven't talked to anyone about this because I don't want her to feel like I'm airing our dirty laundry to any of our friends. Instead, I'm airing it here, I guess.   I'm not even sure why.  Maybe I'm hoping if I let it out, it will help?  I just don't know.   I don't feel like I have anything to lose at this point, and I don't feel like life is worth living anymore.  What's the point of it all?    Anyway, I have 800 units of regular insulin ready to go.   Thanks for reading.

No longer able to feel happiness ,"I(34F) have come to the realization over the last 6 months or so that I may be ""depressed"", incapable of feeling genuine happiness or excitement. Absolutely nothing triggers any dopamine or any sense of joy. None of the things that I used to look forward to or jump out of bed about gives me the same feeling or any feeling at all anymore.
I've gone through a lot in the last year, and life has a funny sense of humor at my expense it seems. 
For example, I was finally ""excited"" for my birthday this year, and the morning of I woke up at 8am with a migraine so bad..I was in bed until 4 pm canceling the plans my boyfriend made.  Then I went out to meet my best friend once I was well enough (plans he made a week prior), and he never showed, ending a 14 year long friendship.

Another example.. going on a trip I've been looking forward to for months and spent loads on..only to get my period (off schedule) the day we arrive and be in so much pain and unable to do many activities for days .

Meeting friends for a concert we've all been looking forward to..only to have them no show. That's happened twice this year, different friends.

I could go on and on and on with similar examples..

I've lost so many friendships this year because I no longer tolerated the one sidedness of it. If I don't reach out.. they are gone. 

My workplace brings me down more than anything, and ive tried out other jobs but they just don't pay as well. So right now I'm not working much.
I just don't know how to cope. 
I feel numb and no longer capable of achieving anything above a 5/10 on the mood scale. My boyfriend and I have a wonderful relationship, but i know this weighs on him because he is such an excitable person.
Does anyone have any sort of advice? 
I'd like to do therapy, but I have no insurance at my job and it's not in my budget.
I've tried friendship apps and going out to meet new groups.. no luck.

I know this sounds so wah wah stop crying. I'm annoyed at myself most of the time believe me..but I'm desperate for some real advice/help. ",Queen_La_Queefah,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1qtx8/no_longer_able_to_feel_happiness/
the desire to not exist for a bit,"so, hi, i just woke up from a sleep that i have been struggling to fix lately .

(since i have been staying up all night for the past few months, i decided to change it last night and i did wake up 2 times under a 2 hr interval but its all good)

i woke up the 2nd time and i decided to not go back to sleep immediately in order to write this clutching thought of mine so i could get some peace:

'i don't want to exist for a while'

stil looms over my head a few months ago and grew ever more strongly these past few weeks . 

with repetitive days coming by (days feeling like it doesnt progress, but rather loops), problems, responsibilities, and things you hate about 'life' coming onto you like a landslide of some sorts. yeah, its taken a toll on me mentally.

i could summarize it as just me losing it and losing interest in life as my philosophy has definitely circled around itself as 'there's not much significance to be around' anymore i say.

i grew up in an okay religious family and i was treated okay, finances are okay and etc. so definitely not a family problem .

lol idk what 2 write anymore definitely, i ran out of fuel or i just simply lost interest anymore in continuing this as suppose to my enthuaism earlier in the first few sentences of this post.

it hurts, i don't want to be something or someone, i don't want to feel anxious everyday, feel pressured everyday, and sad everyday whenever i see or think of myself.

My entire life is about to change and I can't cope. Depressed for the first time in my life,"I've been living with my ex gf for 5 years. It's been a really long time and she was my first ever gf. We broke up roughly a year and a half ago but we have still been living together with her two cats (who we got as kittens 5 years ago). We've had our ups and downs and argue sometimes, but we also laugh together and I do enjoy talking to her.

A few weeks ago, she suddenly told me that she will be moving to her own place. I understand why she wants to, but it just came as a shock to me. My little brother is in a bad situation at the moment, and he comes here every week to stay with us. He looked extremely sad and worried when I told him that I'll have to leave, and this made me more upset.

To make matters worse, she's taking the cats (who I have bonded with and lived with since they were kittens). She's leaving today and I'm really dreading it and feel extremely upset about it. I'll move to my grandmother's house in a few weeks, and I'm REALLY not looking forward to that but I have no other option.

Another thing is that I have had a new serious relationship for roughly a year, but she also hasn't been able to live with me. And to make things even worse....it seems like she will break up with me soon. It kind of feels like I'm losing two people at once (along with my cats) and also won't be able to hang out with my little brother regularly anymore.

The only light at the end of the tunnel is that I might finally be able to realize my dream and live overseas in 6 months. Not having to pay rent anymore by living at my grandmother's house will enable me to save up and finally go. That makes me really nervous but I'm also excited as it is my dream.

I'm usually a happy-go-lucky person and rarely get sad, but this is the first time in my life that I feel genuinely depressed and really upset. Not sure how to handle it and would really appreciate some advice.

Forsaken Myself,"Heh, 21 years constantly fighting on a warpath. Achieving success after success, building myself up and investing in myself. Only for all of it to be stripped away. Once a genetically modified freak of nature, only to end up as mere flesh and bones. No medical objective reason. Alone with my thoughts, voluntarily. Albeit I can’t even hear them anymore. 

Every single day, helping countless people. Life deserves to be a place of serenity and tranquility for everyone.

Or so I thought.

I have reached to a point where: I no longer formulate thoughts in my head. Constant autopilot mode, pure instinct. These decades of reading, absorbing knowledge, working tirelessly for validation only to become a laughing stock. Focus? Concentration? Achieving tasks? Used to mean something to me, it’s not that I don’t have the energy to talk. It’s just I literally don’t come up with anything of use. Thoughts that used to take me milliseconds to form now take minutes. It’s painful watching this fall from grace yet live it as well. 

Emptiness, hollowness. Numb. 
These 3 words pretty much sum up my situation. 

I honestly still don’t know the reason I get out of bed. I’ve seen my family and friends reach out and try their utmost best to help me. Can’t pour out of an empty cup sadly. It takes me an insurmountable amount of effort to even utter words. 

I am too much of a coward to proceed with my life, or do anything really. So this raises the question, “Why Live?” I am also too much of a coward to take my own life.

Crossroads, I have now decided to fully confine myself in my room. Spend the rest of my days staring into the abyss, 0 activity. Just pondering the walls of my room. Only then will I feel true inner peace having obliterated my life rather than face public humiliation. I don’t get to hear it anymore. 

Ambition? Drive? Passion? Aspirations? Goals? Nah. I’ll pass. I tried and I have nothing left to give anymore. 

I am about to go to a therapist (forced by my father) tomorrow. I grew up in a community where mental health is severely stigmatized due to heavy religious influence so I wonder what her reactions going to be when I showcase this adamant desire. Truly is pathetic. 




For the first time in my life, I’ve went from a social bubbly person to embracing 4 months of self-inflicted self-sabotage. All sense of self-identity, self-worth, self esteem has virtually dissipated. Can’t even follow along plots of shows anymore. Don’t remember anything. Purely living in the moment. The bliss of being alone! 

Should I document this journey Im about to embark? I’m 100% serious that I will genuinely live the rest of my days locked in my room with no socialization or any form of contact. Atleast that way people can examine and I can atleast have my legacy be that as an experiment. I’m willing to purchase a camera and send the footage to anyone who wants it, sort of like a vlog lmao. Eh idk spitballing ig.

I struggle with suicidal thoughts but don't feel depressed.,"I've always felt a feeling of depression within myself growing up. Id say I am a happy personality with a sad soul. I never considered it to be depression because I did not have terrible thoughts about myself or feelings of worthlessness until 2020. It slowly increased and In 2021 I experienced a very dark depression and finally understand the true meaning of it. You truly cannot grasp how it feels until you've experience the pain and the thoughts. It's like no matter what you have, do or know, the thoughts and feelings do not falter. I tried so many coping mechanisms to make life better but could not get my mind to heal. I knew I had a desirable life on the outside looking in, and still felt such worthlessness, self hate and did not want to continue living. I contemplated and planned suicide a lot. I'd cry every single day and drown in the misery of waking up again and having to go through more life. It felt as though anything I try to do to make life better, it made it worse. It is such an internal battle. I finally started taking antidepressant during that time period because I started to actively seek out ways to commit suicide and get the means to do so. It healed my mind so much. I finally felt happy again, id speak to my mom and just tell her how happy I feel everyday. I stopped after a while and still felt some depressive symptoms but not as deep and harrowing. I also have ADHD. I changed a lot of aspects of my life and did a lot of reflection and introspection and I do feel better generally in life. I think back at this time and it feels like such a traumatic life event. Just having my brain be so dark. Its an unforgettable feeling and time of my life that changed me so much.

With that being said this past year in 2023 I broke up with a boyfriend of 8 years who cheated and then got into a very traumatic, abusive relationship with a narcissist. A canon event I'd say. The abuse, betrayal and evil I experienced from someone I loved was so extreme and confusing. It left me with no job or home because I had to escape from him and run to a different state for my safety. Ive been struggling to heal from this and find work as well. Reflecting on all of this and the current state of my life leaves me very sad. Rebuilding my self worth as well as being completely alone every day is very saddening after having back to back very codependent relationships. I am very unproductive and sit home every day with barely any social interactions. I know I need hobbies and activities but its hard to find motivation... With that being said I do not feel that depressed. I'm sad often but I would not say I feel those deep depressive feelings that I once struggled so deeply with. I can still find some happiness in my day to day. Before, any inconvenience would send me off the deep end but even with all of this new trauma, I do not feel that way. I don't feel depressed but I often feel like ending my life because the struggle of life, the economy and loneliness is just so unbearable and unenjoyable. No plans or real desire but it's a reocurring thought.

It almost seems like once you feel deep depression and suicidal thoughts, they will always return. Depression kind of feels like a cycle or even like an addiction. Not that you desire it but in a way that you go into periods of remission or sobriety and then those thoughts creep up and you bask in your dark feelings. Its like you try not to relapse and when you feel yourself slipping you have to fight, and it scares you. Or even like a spectrum that you constantly teeter on. Its almost like you can never get rid of the darkness inside of you. Sometimes I think I enjoy feeling deep emotion, whether good or bad. But bad emotions run so deep they sometimes feel intoxicating....

Please tell me your opinion,"Tell me if anyone understands what I feel

I’m so depressed and all I want is to die. I wasn’t feeling well and my partner made me make an appointment with my therapist. I am not on any medication but I had some old expired antidepressant medication at home and my therapist was aware of it. My therapist asked if I took any medication and I said yes. Then he asked if I took more than one and I said, Im doing well now. He continued by asking did you do intentional overdose on your medication and I responded, Im doing well now and I don’t like to talk about it. He said he wants to talk with my partner and I declined. Then he said that he has to call a police for well ness check and after some begging and discussion I relented and let him talk with my partner. He told my partner every thing and after that call, my partner collected all my pills and ruined my plan for my next overdose. The therapist told my partner that I will receive a call for iop program. I have not received the call yet but I will reject it once they call. I am mad at both of them and I am thinking to cut my hand deep ( never have done cutting) or take a bunch of Tylenol.

Help me please ,"I don't know how to really start this. It's hard for me to ask for help as a adult man. But I'm in need of help immediately. I have put this off for far to long after being told by a friend I should ask for help here. Let's start with why I need help. This is a lot so bare with me please. I feel I need to tell the whole story so everyone that is going to help knows exactly what happened even if it means putting all my personal information out there. The main thing I am worried about is my oldest son. He has been struggling with adhd and depression since he started school. He is on medication and sees doctors twice a month for it. To say the least I'm his strong backbone that helps him when he has his bad days. I was forced to leave him and ever since he had really been struggling. I'm asking for help to fix my car (650) and get gas money (350)to get back to be in the same state with him and as well as my other kids but he needs me the most especially now. He is turning 10 on July 18th. I want to be back there for him and with him as soon as possible. I can't describe how much stress this has caused me mentally and physically. I been working at a dead end job to just try and stay afloat and get my car fixed which just stopped working so I can get back to him. I'm really ashamed to ask for help as a grown man. But it isn't about me anymore. I need to get back to him and I can't do it on my own.I NEED HELP. PLEASE.


Here is a back story to what happened to get me in this situation. At the end of last year 2023 around November I lose my home that I worked to keep for two years. ( A lil back story. I'm not trying to bash anyone or place all blame on anyone because I'm at somewhat fault as well for not seeing the signs. I was blinded by what I thought was love. It all started on Christmas Eve 2021 when my life began to change. My and my girlfriend of a year at the time were in a a really bad car accident. She was injured pretty bad. So I took on the mantle of providing for our family. This turned out to be a crucial decision. I spent the next two years busting my tail to provide for her and her daughter as well as my own three kids I have. It was working out pretty good for a year or more or so. I was able to maintain our home and both our cars. It started to get overwhelming after such a lengthy period of time. In this time I exhausted all my avenues of trying to stay afloat and allowing her to heal properly by staying at home and me taking all responsibilities for everything. I maxed out all my credit cards and was working two jobs day and night to try to be the man and keep everything that I had gotten for us. I finally after so long pressured her to start looking for a job I could no longer do it alone. Which gets to where the main problems started to happen. I didn't realize how much pressure I was putting on her because I was stressed out and maxed out. Well this pressure actually made things worst because now things she didn't say before came to light. Which was she was depressed on how the car accident made her look and feel and she shut down. So for the next half of year or so when I begged for help and pleaded I couldn't do it anymore. Things took a turn for the worst. Instead of helping me she shut down. Then month by month we ended up getting lights turned off. Next month water turned off. It was just a domino affect. One thing lead to another. Robbing Peter to pay Paul as they say. Finally it came to a head and we were kicked out of our home because turns out she was not paying the bills like I thought she was. Which is why I take blame I put all that on her to pay the bills (as in call in and make sure they were paid since I was working to make the money for them. All while she was not doing that. She was depressed coming to find out because of how she felt after the accident. So instead of paying the bills she used lots of the money for self care which turned out to be cheating as well. So we are kicked out and all of our things put on the curb. I was then forced to move states away from my kids with family because I had no where else to go. I'm am cracking under the pressure mentally and physically to be quite honest. Seeing my son struggle ever since I had to leave is heart breaking. I'm only asking for help to fix my car and gas to get back there. I already have a friend that is going to allow me to stay with them until I get back on my feet so I can be closer to my kids. I have secured a job for when I get back there so I'm not asking for handouts and not doing anything positive to help myself. I just need a little help to get ahead.


Anthing would help whether it's a dollar or two or if your feeling more generous. I just want to get back to my son where I belong and where he needs me. I thank everyone in advance for taking the time to read my story and possibly helping. Thank you may God bless us all.

"Things aren’t going to get better for me, I’m a lost cause","I’m so incredibly lost, I don’t know what I’m doing with my life. I have no friends, I have nothing to look forward to, everything is so fucking expensive and I really just want to end it. I’m so tired of being depressed and my family telling me to get my shit together. “No one can do it but you” I know that, I know I can do anything unless as I put my mind to it but the thing is you have to want it. I simply don’t, I don’t think this life is worth living. For what? So I can work my life away at a job I don’t even like, take a vacation maybe once or twice a year if I’m lucky and spend a majority of my life alone doing mundane tasks until I die a slow painful death. I don’t want to hurt my family by committing suicide but I can’t possibly see a reality where I’m content, mental health help is a fucking joke. I’ve tried everything, I’ve been on meds, I’ve gone to therapy. Several different types: TMS, neurofeedback, qi gong, EFT, EMDR, equine therapy, reiki etc. we are not meant to live like this. We are social creatures and we live in a society that is ultra independent, we need community but “third places” hardly exist anymore and how do people have time or money for hobbies ? I feel like everything we were told about growing up was a fucking lie. This shit sucks and it’s probably only going to get worse and I don’t want to be around to see it.

lack of motivation,"i don’t wanna feel this way anymore. it’s so overwhelming and tiresome. i have so many things in mind, so many ideas i wanna execute but zero motivation to do them. 

i just wanna rot in bed and rot my brain. but when i rot in bed, i blame myself for not being active or not doing enough — i just can’t find it in me to do anything, to be anything.

my moodswings and crazy urges are coming back. i’m constantly seeking cheap dopamine (a loooot of media consumption). i talk and text people, but i lose interest mid-conversations or get annoyed almost instantly. even after seeking cheap dopamine and trying to entertain myself with trivial stuff, i cant bring myself to improve on my interests or try new things out — things i know will stimulate my brain and encourage me to do more. i guess knowing i can achieve more yet not doing anything about it pushes me back into that “self-blaming” scenario. 

it’s genuinely so lame to feel this way, it’s like a brain infestation. ):

My life is a complete joke…,"To be fair, I have a lot of things to be grateful for. I’m not starving and I have family that cares enough to let me at least stay with them again (though I’m afraid of my mental health tanking with them). I’ve had bad mental health issues since I was 12 years old, that was my first time attempting to harm myself and feeling like dying. I had bad internalized homophobia over liking women and I had to get over that recently. I ended up dating a guy during covid in college summer of 2020. I don’t want to say he was completely abusive. I was horrible and toxic in my own way due to my own traumas, and there are things I should’ve never done, like be overly jealous and threw things he bought me away out of spite, or dropping his toothbrush on the bathroom floor rug after an argument, which I immensely regret because it turns out it could’ve caused bad illness, as well as having a meltdown in front of him which caused him to freak out. But the sexual stuff really fucked me up and how I see my body. I learned after telling people I was definitely raped…and gaslit into thinking I wasn’t. I even feel weird saying that because it doesn’t feel real. I thought I was making it up as an excuse to act mentally ill. He did things that I didn’t consent to on more than one occasion. And shamed me into feeling like crap for asking him to…ask. I explicitly said no when trying to do my homework. I pretended to be ok with the sudden fingering. Then I said no sex tho. Then he just kinda did it. And I pretended to be ok with it. Afterwards I just cried in the shower and kept thinking about it when I was trying to do my homework. It wasn’t just that. I realized he would constantly sexualize me. He didn’t really give a fuck about my hobbies or interests or playing cool games together. The worst time was when I was trying to show off a lego set I got for christmas, after my dad was arrested for a dui (I was supposed to talk to him about his alchoholism but didn’t wanna ruin christmas so I felt like it was my fault). He said he didn’t give a fuck and asked me to flash my tits, which I did hesitantly. I took nudes of myself for him and he threatened to break up two days after that. I was basically personal jerkoff material and felt sexually humiliated. I was also pressured into sex in my own car in the beginning of our relationship. I never really got support from my mom after telling her. I guess she just wanted me to not let it affect my academic performance. I know I could’ve stayed home, but I felt so guilty for letting it affect me and wanted to prove I wasn’t broken. I didn’t want to be seen as a failure because of what happened to me. Plus, I don’t feel completely safe around my family. One of the biggest things keeping me in that relationship was thinking I was receiving love and praise that I hadn’t gotten from my family in years. I went through a bad hypersexual phase, thankfully online though, realized I was a lesbian, but the feelings around how much I hate my body and especially being female are surfacing. I keep feeling like I should be a boy instead now. Ever since I left that relationship I keep having new identity crisis themes or anxieties that I have to constantly think about or else I feel something bad will happen. I feel like such a different person. I look at the person I was before that relationship. I was depressed and mentally ill as well as undiagnosed autistic at the time, but I was so excited to finally get out of my household. Now I even feel like I’ve developed gender dysphoria. I can’t stand my useless body. I need to be on meds and therapy again. I feel so angry with everyone who was supposed to help and support me.

Muddled thoughts on intent,"Not a long rant cause I have tried to explain this to friends and family but they dont understand what I mean, and why i cant just let go.

I am obsessing over the intent of my own actions. Weather im nice because im \*actually\* nice, or am I just subconsciously behaving in such a way that makes me likable. And ontop of this I've been making massive mistakes, and hurting people i really care about. I hate even to be angry or upset with people, let alone actually inflict any emotional or physical harm.   
Im pushing everyone away cause I dont want to hurt them, and Im afraid to talk to people cause I feel so two faced if im just behaving in ways that make me likable.

Again, I know it sounds stupid to be hung up on things like that because life happens, and every person wants to be liked (as I have been told numerous times). But i just cant let it go.

I struggle with dissatisfaction with life and hating myself,"I live in a constant state of dissatisfaction, regret, envy, and self-loathing. 
 
People think I’m exaggerating when I say this but there is truly nothing I like about myself. I don’t like how I look. I don’t like how I sound. I don’t like how my mind works.

I hate how pathetic I am, how stupid I am. I’ve become everything I look down on. I have no accomplishments. No medals. Sure life isn’t about medals but they are to me. To be praised, to be envied, to be held in high regard. I envy my athletic classmates all the time. It’s too late for me to be a prodigy. I’m not good at anything. Anything I’m remotely decent doing is clouded by the fact that it will never give me what I want and I would trade it any day for something else. 

I want nothing out of life. I hate nature. I hate the rain. Hate the sun. I hate when people think that I should care about losing these things. There’s nothing I like that isn’t tied to being a consumer. I am materialistic at heart and I don’t plan on changing my ways. I consume what I can afford and dream about consuming things that are expensive. But even that will never fill the hole I feel where there should be a zest for living.

I don’t care. I can only see life going down from here (shitty college and generally not motivation to get out of bed). Yeah yeah life isn’t about where you go or whatever. We all hear it. But for someone like me, these things are important. I believe people are measured by their achievements and success. I believe that life is linear. You do this, you do that, and you do it well. 

Everywhere I look, I’m dissatisfied with how things work and look down on everything including myself. I hate and look down on this country. I look down on my school. I look down on my family and friends. I look down on the bad things happening in the world.

Sure, some might venture to say that it’s this dissatisfaction with the world that makes it my calling to change it or fucking something. But there is nothing and no one I look down on more than myself. It’s not just my circumstances I despise, it’s me. I am disgusted with myself. 

The answer is simple right? Just change then. Some would say. But I can’t change. I don’t want to. I will remain in this cycle. Because it’s not my actions I hate (though it’s also a part of it). It’s my person. I hate the person I am at my very core. I hate how I squirm when my wrongdoings are held in front of me like a child caught in a lie, with my mouth open like a fish. I hate how people see right through me. I hate how I pretend to be smarter than I really am but if you really quiz me, I know nothing. I don’t have the answers. I’m not interesting. 

The only things I don’t hate and I think are worth looking at are the things that make me envious. And when I envy, my stomach is twisted into a knot and I feel nauseous. I’m constantly jealous. But I don’t plan on removing the things that make me jealous because I deserve to feel jealous. It’s torture seeing the people have what I want, do what I want to do, receive worldwide recognition, being beautiful. Say what you want about taking a break from social media but you don’t understand how much I need to see it. It makes me despise myself even more than I really did. I keep a compilation of these things and dedicate a self-inflicted, mental torture session sometimes. 

Everywhere I look, I see no reason to give it my time of day. I see no reason to live. I hate everything. It seems childish but at its core, I hate everything. Everyday, I wake up cursing because I have to go through this again. The dissatisfaction. The envy. 

I want to die and I’m tired. I know I’m the problem. But I don’t care.

It started out with me always feeling like I haven’t done “enough” school-wise during the last few months before summer break even though I had a nearly perfect GPA.

I have been bullied mercelessly troughout the years because and was on edge the entire school year because I was so excited to finally  leave these idiots behind and have a fresh start in hs.
The final day of 8th grade finally came and I felt absolutely nothing except resentment and anger even though I was supposed to be happy that it was finally over.
I didn’t even want to  say goodbye to the teachers that were kind to me and actually “tried” to help me during these years of torment.

I spent most of my summer sleeping till twelve in the afternoon,crying and moping around.

I distanced myself from my one and only friend, even blocked their number.I also  lost my abillity to draw, come up with ideas and even socialize.
Nothing interests me anymore.

My dear mother has let me know multiple times that everyone would be happier if I finally jumped.
Though everytime she swears that she could have never said something like that of course.

I finished my first year of hs now and nothing really changed except the bullying part.People just treat me like a little lost dog now lol.

She was the only person in the world that could snap me out of depression. At this point not even love could. She knew I was living with my lone grandmother. One day she had a stroke and I had to leave town. I was so sad I may never get to see my prof again. But I held on the hope that she would get better. There was that voice at the back of my head telling me that something bad had happened to the prof. 

It turned out true her mother died and she was all alone. I promised to always visit. 

I got severe depression because i couldn't handle seeing the my hero this broken. I decided to be her hero and make her happy.

I visited several time with gifts, agreed I would help her with researches. I visited once and then she told me to come again the following day even calling me son.

I went and a friend of hers (that doesnt know me) humiliated me for being unemployed and made fun of everything even saying that she would report me for harassment if I ever came again. All this while my prof played dumb or joked at my expense.

She knew how much she meant to me and still did that. I started flipping out knowing that she will have to cut me off to preserve her image being a single woman and all.

And it was true she now wouldn't even talk to me in the street or would very aggressive leaving while I am talking.


This has made me spiral into a lot of sexual or that I am into older women and violent thoughts, therapy didn't help and nothing is getting better it has been a year.

My brain is forcing me to either fix it somehow or end myself. And I know she isn't worth it either.

Always suffered now worse,"Always been depressed. Married with kids, but feel I have made a mistake. Realising that having thought I was bi, likely I was homosexual.

Had a heart attack a few years ago, cannot do what I used to. Was told by cardiologist what fitness I don’t get back in the first year I never will get back. Was doing well and got a chest infection. Took months to recover and it knocked me back a long way. No confidence to try as I was told it would be futile. Now my liver has started to pack in due to being so overweight (100kg, 175cm) - I’ve already been told this was the sole reason for the heart attack.

Wife didn’t say that we hadn’t paid our tax bill, I know it was my responsibility, but she had always dealt with it so I didn’t worry. Now we owe £70k and cannot pay it back.

i feel like a burden,"i've been feeling off for a whole month already.  i've been having severe health anxiety, panic attacks, ocd, and depression.

yesterday, i had one of the worst panic attacks ever. it happened at 2:00 am-ish and i woke my mom up because it was so bad.

a few minutes into the panic attack she kept telling me stuff like ""get off your phone"" ""do something else"" ""i don't understand why this is happening to you.  you get everything you want"" bla bla bla.  i felt sad as hell but i slept it off

i woke up the next morning and the energy between me and my mom changed.  it felt distant and she looked, sad.  i asked her ""why do you look so sad?"" and she told me ""my husband's already a crazy man, and even you are crazy too.  i hate myself.  everything was a mistake."".  

i don't know what to do anymore.  it's not like i can control whatever my mind thinks, what my mind does to me, &amp; what my mind manifests in my body.  i just want to kill myself so she wouldn't have to care for me anymore.  i love my mom, she's the best person i've ever known and maybe me committing suicide would be the best option for me and her.

When Will It End?,"I've been depressed since high school, and it seems I can't catch a break.

 I live with my step mother and step father in the literal middle of nowhere (my bio mom died in childbirth and then my bio dad remarried to my step mother and they both got custody of me, but then my dad died and my step mother got to keep custody and she remarried fairly recently) and I've been struggling with unemployment and housing crises due to serious health issues that have been ruining my life for five years.

I applied for disability (with my health issues, its a guarantee I'll get approved) in order to help with the unemployment, but it's taking forever to get back. I've been jobless for two years and my unemployment finally ran out this month.I have no car and the nearest town to get a job is 74 minutes away. I literally have no idea how I'm going to feed me or my cat for the next two weeks. 

I don't know how I'm doing anything or even operating at this point, to be honest. It's a lot worse than I'm going to reveal on Reddit to strangers, because, even though this is a throw away account, I feel so much shame in my current situation.

I don't know how much longer I can stay living with my step parents, because my step father makes all these sexual comments about my body and has even laid his hands on me on a couple of occasions, and I don’t know what to do anymore. I spend all day in my bedroom now and rarely leave except at night. At night I sneak down the hall to the kitchen and eat whatever little food I have left. I tried talking about it to my aunt (step mother's sister) about it, but she tried to sway me against it and she's the only other family member I have in contact with.

I have no friends here. I have no real support system. I'm just day in day out living with the chronic dread that I

1) am disabled

2) don't have a job/can't have a job

3) have to deal with my disgusting step father, and 

4) am cooped up in a bedroom all day in fear, because I don't want to even see my step father.

(I seriously think I'm developing some sort of sick eating disorder from this. My eatting schedule and amounts are so irregular, this cannot be healthy. I wish I had a car so I could get the hell away from this shitty farm.)

It's so hard to like ask them that you need them to be there for you but I'm trying to do it slowly until I completely let them in. But even so, I'm just still emotionally exhausted and I don't think I could go on a day without worrying abt something. It's justs my mind been active quite a lot. Even if they're also there for me I just don't feel them at all. As well as things like I used to find it fun doesn't even excite me anymore. Overtime, I think everything build's up which it gets harder for me to express my needs to people.

And so from the age of 8 until now (I'm 19). My mother labels everyone mentally ill because she ""learned"" about them on... Facebook. She is pro-feminist, she speaks in whatever way is convenient for her, and when I accuse her of changing her opinion from one to the completely opposite in an argument, she shouts that she doesn't give a damn and doesn't care, and then instead of ending the argument, she jumps from the topic to the topic that I'm an addict. from playing (but the fact that she smokes cigarettes is her business and no one is allowed to talk about it...), that I'm like my father (he's as crazy as she is). And my father, who is aggressive and never allows a different opinion without insults, tried to force me to work with him twice and once almost beat me, and the second time he attacked me screaming that he would kill me, I was with him very far from home, I was very helpless, my sister and I usually hugged each other after fending off his aggressive attacks, then I was alone...

To get to the point, I absolutely want to die, when I looked in the mirror and saw the resemblance of my father's face, I stopped looking at myself in the mirror until I grew my hair very long and lost 45 kilos to gain a more feminine appearance because the male one disgusts me strongly. I would love to kill them both and then myself because I know that I come from this pathology. I didn't have love my whole life because girls avoided me and the ones that talked to me ghosted me.

Struggling to determine exactly what is going on...any help is appreciated,"Hi all,

I have been struggling with Depression and likely Anxiety for 20+ years, but in the past 10 it has gotten worse. There was a point where I was relapsing into deep depression 4 to 5 times a year that took a month or more to recover from. I was doing a little better, but now I am dealing with something I am not sure how to handle.

It first happened a few months ago on a work trip. I had just finished up for the day and was looking forward to getting back to my room to relax and watch a movie. I got into my room and sat on the side of the bed, and then it started. The best way I can describe it was a heat starting in my feet and slowly rising, as it moved up my body I could feel all of the concerns I usually struggle with during depression creep its way back in to my mind. I couldn't control it and that scared me which of course made things worse. It took a week for me to get back to myself. 

I am struggling through the fallout of the the same thing now. I again was just relaxing and it started to come over me in the same way. I am someone who does a lot of research when I struggle with things, and I think these might be panic attacks? 

The thing that scares me is that I can not seem to stop them. I try breathing exercises, meditation, exercise, but I can't stop it. I am on meds for depression, Sertraline and buspirone, but I am at a loss for how to control this or at least prevent it. Any ideas or help?

Too many strings attached ,"I want to preface this by saying I feel kinda guilty for posting it. There's so many people dealing with monumental issues and suicide, and my heart goes out to ya'll, but I'm hoping I can get some empathy for my own painful but less critical situation. 

I have been dealing with heavy depression for 10 years, started meds last year and they are kinda helping. I left a 3 year relationship a few months ago because I kept falling in and out of depressive episodes leading to the decline of the relationship. During the end also realized I felt trapped with her. I loved her more than any person but being constrained was creating more unhappy feelings than she was creating happy ones. The irony felt cruel. I always love a good excuse to self destruct, so I did and I left her right after. 

Now I'm with someone else. She's poly, and I guess I am now too. I tried so hard to be friends with my ex but she found out I rebounded and now she told me she never wants to speak to me again. I miss her like crazy. What did I trade her for? I'm falling for this new person (who is someone I've been just friends with for a year) and she is in a long term relationship with another guy, and were also together in whats becoming pretty intense. I miss the previous love of my life and Im falling in love with someone who will always have others. I'm ok with that for now...but I'm starting to feel this creeping, weighted sense of hopelessness that I have been right all along - I will never be happy no matter what I try.

Now, I'm going to graduate next year. Technically, I am the top of my year. So, academically,I'm doing well. My family life is better than it used to be. I have a long term relationship. I lost friends, but I got even better ones later on. Even though I'm a student, I worked at several places that are HUGE boosts to my resume.

Yet, I still hate myself. I sit down at night and I think I'm not good enough, that I've never been. This summer I tried to learn book writing and screenwriting. I completed some courses. Yesterday I started to work out intensively even thought I'm of average weight. (Have to note that I'm hurting myself by working out because I have a heart problem.)

These are great achievements to other people but STILL, I feel like I'm not enough. People tell me they'd do anything to be as 'smart' as me but I can't take them seriously because I think I'm not good enough. This is causing me to make decisions that will harm me physically AND mentally. I don't know if I want to punish myself or if I want validation but it's bothering me a lot and I don't know what to do.

Lonely. ,"Hi guys. My name is E and I’m currently 24 years old. Been severely depressed for as long as I can remember. Been through various rounds of medications, therapies, hospitalizations, the whole thing. I don’t understand why I am the way that I am. Growing up I never struggled, at least financially. I feel guilty for my illness. My parents never deserved to have to put up with me. Now that I’m an adult, things are even worse despite my medication I’ve been on consistently for over 2 years. Everyday is the same. I’m deteriorating mentally but don’t have the heart to handle it. I turned to Reddit because I feel like a burden to the ones around me and to the ones who know me. Maybe here I can find the support I need without being a waste of time to the ones who’ve tried to help. Anyone else feel this way?

Yeah depression sucks,I’d like to say it gets easier but really it just gets more manageable. I’ve been taking meds for a long time and it keeps the constant sadness at bay. I do have a lot in my life that makes me happy and that is what sucks because sadness will always win out no matter how wonderful my life can be. It’s always been like this and I’ve talked to therapists and read books and they help but depression is always standing by. Everybody here understands and some are really struggling.

23M Am I screwed if I didn't have close childhood friendships and missed out on some youthful things?,"I'm 23M. Long story short, I had a best friend when I was in early childhood and honestly that was the best part of my life. But then he moved away and although I had some friends after, none really ever came close to him. I just felt so loved and special around him, but he moved away so soon.

I experienced some neglect too. There were times in my life where the only peers my age I got to see were like once a week on Sundays for 3 hours at most. It really sucked. Apparently I hung out with my neighbors multiple days a week for years for most of elementary according to my mom, but I don't remember. I trust my mom but maybe she doesn't remember? Idk. I'm worried I only saw them once a week at most. Is that normal? I guess she probably remembers just fine.

I wish I could've gone to sports. I wish I could've seen other kids my age every day like the public schoolers got to do. I wish we had more money to do fun stuff with my friends. I wish I got to have a big birthday party with my best friend and a bunch of other people. I wish I could've gone to prom. I wish I could've had a sleepover (with close friends that actually liked me). I wish I could've seen my friends every day in summer and did summer stuff, even if it was just one friend.

I was such a lonely child. This probably sounds pathetic but in middle school I used to pretend I had a little brother and he'd sit with me in the car and talk and we'd cuddle.

Why do I always have to be alone? Why do the people closest to me always have to go? I don't mind having responsibilities or do adult things but all my friends wanna get married, but I'm not ready to move to that stage of life.

I just want to be as close to someone like a little brother like I could've been in childhood.

I don't hate my life. I love my life. I never asked for a perfect life I just asked for someone special to be with.

Is it too late for me? Can I still have a close best friend that I can see every day? I just want a best friend like I used to have, and have them be in my life for longer than a short period of time. I just want to feel that close to someone again. It'd even be nice to have a close group of friends. I never asked for a perfect life, just one where I had someone special.

I'm scared that even if I did get a best friend, that it just wouldn't be the same as it would've been back then. That they'll act too ""old"" and ""mature"", and that there won't be as much fun stuff to do because no one really cares about young adults as much.

My friend denies that he has depression or was abused,"So to summarize yesterday my friend and I had a conversation about his self harm and suicide attempts, and I proposed him an idea of talking a supportive part of his family to get through the current wave of his depression, but he started to deny that he even has it, and said that he has no reason to be depressed. I pointed out the beatings he's received throughout his childhood and the mental abuse more recently, yet he continued to deny it, saying that he was feeling like that for a long time. As we talked he just continued to give me more agruments in my favor, yet denying that he has depression and refusing to talk to anyone.  
  
I'm not sure how to convince him that his situation is serious and that he should get help. And I'm looking for general advice on how to help someone with depression.

Sometimes I don't want to let go of my pain and trauma because it's the only thing that feels solely mine,"And I know it's not good. I know I need to let go of the pain in order to start getting better. I've already healed a lot since I was removed from my traumatic circumstance, but part of me always holds onto a bit of that resentment towards the world. 

Nobody has experienced exactly what I went through because no two people have the same exact feelings and experiences. In a way, that brings me comfort. It is not something I have to or can share with anyone else. It is 100% ""me"", 100% ""fine"", so I keep that bitterness so that sometimes I can just...be angry. I can be angry at the world and nobody else can feel that same anger and for once I feel like a complete individual. For once I don't have to share something. 

I don't know. Maybe I need some sort of ego death. It's strangely cathartic though. My pain is mine and nobody else can have it and something about that feels good, even if it always ends up hurting me. 

It must be part of the depression, right? I don't know if anyone else feels this way, though. ",thr-w-w-y3,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1dve5/sometimes_i_dont_want_to_let_go_of_my_pain_and/

Mentally exhausted ,"I’ve lived a pretty isolated life, I was never physically abused but entirely emotionally neglected and strongly ignored by family my entire childhood (and most of my adulthood)

I was taken out of school at around 1st grade and my parents never put me back in so my education stopped there and I developed social anxiety and basically hid away in the run down bedroom at the back of our house all my childhood, I remember going days at a time never even seeing my family because of there work schedule and everyone just left me to my devices so I was alone there.

Around the age of 18 my father died and I kinda realized maybe I should try to do something with my life which started the long process of simply becoming a person, I straight didn’t even know how to tie my shoes till I was like 19, never needed to know and as kid it’s not like that was too on the to do list over playing PlayStation for instance.

I only ever learned spell half legibly because people in online games used to make fun of me for it and I got tired of it.

The point being I know nothing, I’ve done nothing, and I have no one.

I’ve been making a huge effort to be better, especially these last few years, I got a job I really like and wanted to learn more and do more in this field so I restarted my education, I got tired of being a fat piece of shit so I started trying to loose weight, I got tired of being alone so I started trying to date or just meet people who actually want to hear me speak or care about me in some way.

None of it’s really working, just kinda stagnating in stress of trying to do anything.

I turn 29 in less than a month and I’m just nothing, just here for no reason I don’t know if it’s worth the trouble of doing all this to maybe be a mediocre person when I am 40 and about to die of the heart disease gifted to me by my dads side of the family.

The job I have offers an EAP that I’ve debated calling but I truly just can’t deal with telling another person about my problems just to either listen to them pretend to give a shit or just literally watch there eyes glaze over as they wait for me to stop talking.

Help me please,"Hello everyone I came here to ask for advice on what to do about my parent’s marital problems. My mom recently found out that my father has been seeing another woman, I already knew this a long time ago but I didn’t know what to do I was afraid to tell my mother because I know it would hurt her and I was still young at that time. My father has been a responsible father, he provided us food, a great house, he spoilt us with many gifts and gives us decent amount of money, but I think it’s really painful for my mother because she was trying to do her best to become a good wife, she provided him love and support but he just ignores it. I’m gonna leave for college because I’ll be studying at another region about 1000km, I am really excited to leave because I felt that staying in our house was really intoxicating, my mom would always compare me to my older sister, she would always remind me that I am different than my classmates, (I have been diagnosed with Bipolar disorder) she keeps telling me that I should really be organized and responsible which made me felt incapable of doing and achieving higher dreams since I am being constantly reminded that I can’t do it cause I’m different, she also has her favors on my sister, she always prioritize my sister and praise how good she is and that I should be like her, I tried to be like her once, I remember during my 8th grade I really worked hard to achieve with high honors because I always saw them really proud at my sister, my father even wears his uniform on the stage(he’s a police officer) but at the time of my recognition, nobody came, so I told my teacher I wasn’t feeling well and left, even at my high school graduation I felt really bad cause I asked them to come for my graduation it was only about 4 hours but my father left early and my mother was in a hurry, she keeps calling me that we should go home but I told her if she could wait for a moment cause I was still taking pictures with my classmates whom I would be leaving cause I’ll be studying in another region but she left anyways. I really envied how the other parents hold their children with pride in their eyes. In my sister’s graduation my father took 4 days off to come visit my sister, my mother was prouder than ever, I kept asking myself my graduation only lasted 4 hours and they even couldn’t wait for me, what is it that my sister have and I don’t? It really hurts me how they give so much importance at my sister but I guess she deserves it cause she’s smart, brave and confident and I think it’s because she was born first, my mother would always tell me that I should respect and prioritize her, I remember we transferred to our new house, me and my sister picked the same room but it was given to her cause she was the eldest and naturally eldest gets whats the best, my sister was leaving to study at another region in a few months but I didn’t argue cause younger siblings should always submit and respect their parents and older sibling/s.

Did I have depression as a child?,"When I was little, around 7 or 8 years old, I used to get this... sensation. I'd be lying in bed in the dark and I would get almost a mental image of a ball of dots in my chest. But I'd be frozen in place, my mind would be in chaos. I'd hear my parents or the TV outside, life going on as normal around me, and the ball would start expanding. I felt like it was trying to burst out of me. And I had to ""eat"" it to keep it under control; I had to keep taking huge gulps of air because that's what would make the ball smaller. And I never got it to disappear; I think I just fell asleep from exhaustion. I don't remember thinking anything, just trying to make the ball stop growing.

I've been grappling with my sanity for a few hours now, and I feel mentally the experience is the same as when I was a child. The same feeling of chaos, the attempts at control but now it's trying to think happy thoughts, watching videos to distract myself, belittling myself so I get a grip. The same notion that if I don't have it under control, something really bad will happen. To think about it, it ends the same way as well; eventually giving in to exhaustion with my mind still fried.

It's almost like having a fever, I feel so consumed by this 'pain' in my head. I know even when I'm spiraling and weeping tears and going on a rant about how disgusting I am, how I want to die, how messed up everything is, I know I'm ""going through it"".

As a child, I knew there was something wrong with me. Now, I identify it as depression and feelings of anxiety, misery, anger, foreboding, confusion, guilt, shame, disgust, like a whole mess of things. Mental health wasn't a thing in the country I live in, so my parents just assumed I had a stick up my ass and wanted to be difficult. To be fair to them, I used to do this thing where I'd swallow my food without chewing... I really wanted to die even back then.

But I'm curious, is this an actual thing, or was I incredibly messed up?",Wel_Shit_bat365,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1hpsc/did_i_have_depression_as_a_child/

I want to stop feeling suicidal ,"Ever since I was little I have been suicidal. What triggers it is my relationship with my parents. They are loving but they have made me feel like a disappointment my whole life. My dad would blame every issue he had on me. Even when it came to his marriage with my mom. My mom would say how sick of me she is whenever she would get made at me. If I would make a mistake she would mock me. When I bring this up as an adult I am gaslit into thinking that never happened. Now as an adult if I fail at anything I immediately feel ashamed of myself and I want to die. When my mom ask for money I immediately get mad and want to kill myself because I feel like I can’t have a life outside of them. I feel like a disappointment for not being able to give them more. I constantly fantasize about slitting my wrist and then asking them if they’re proud. But I am so sick of being suicidal. I can’t handle this feeling anymore. I want to die to get rid of this feeling. I feel like my parents would be so happy without me. 

I have a big issue. I have a boyfriend that loves so much. And I don’t want my death to affect him. He has no clue how suicidal I am. I’m so afraid and ashamed to tell him. I love him so much. Sometimes I’m so surprised he likes me. He is the only person who has ever made me feel loved. My parents make me feel like I am not good enough. I really want this feeling to end.

life sometimes does not make sense ,"sometimes I imagine what it would be like to not exist anymore  in a world filled with pain. but for the small glimpse of a second I remember that maybe it doesn’t have to be this way. (Female 22) Over the years and years of being in a psych ward I thought eventually it would help , and it did. But I always find myself being sucked back into the glimpse of reality, that I am alone. 

not that I feel alone, but that I know for a fact I am alone. I have no friends, my family barely even exists, they do, but it’s a difference kind of close, I barley talk to my sister, I can’t talk to her about this kind of stuff Atleast, she’s way older (25 maybe) So not like way older. my exs never understand, I would date a guy and get I guess really sad and I’m not sure they wouldn’t really care like I would hope they would. they would but when you look at them you like know deep down that they really don’t, I’m living in my own nightmare that I cannot wake up from, I used to never get headaches then randomly one day i got a headache and it will not go away. It’s been 8 months of the same damn headache and no matter how many doctors appointments I go to , how many neurologists I see, this headache will not go away. Then it led to chest pain also (cardiologist) cannot find a reason but I know the chest pain is real I FEEL it everyday, it has to be there. 

my life is an endless loop , anxiety, worry, I’m fine, anxiety again, depression, no matter how much help I get I feel hopeless that I will feel like this forever, I can’t talk to anybody about it because they just don’t understand. I try to talk to my boyfriend but he just doesn’t understand, he says anxiety is just a feeling that I create. If I just create it, or even when I don’t think about it.. why the fuck do I feel so fucking lonely and anxious then? my job makes me feel horrible, I feel eh, I feel like I could just walk and walk forever, and I feel nothing. Not a glimpse of anything. not hurt, not pain, I feel nothing. The bad shit always happens to me, my ex left me because his ex had killed herself after we were together for a year already. And I don’t understand why, like I do, but I just get so hurt to think of how I’m always the back burner type person (I deeply sympathize) but it’s like now that she’s gone, it’s all he thinks or talks about , but when I was depressed and tried to die, they laughed in my face about it. 

I will always be the person on the back burner. People just settle for me, and I’m so sick of feeling so fucking empty in a world that is so full. everybody I talk to just wants to have sex, I’m never asked how my day is, I’m never checked up on. And I’m sick of it. I feel so damn empty. and some days I don’t even know why. I get so sad to think nobody  is ever going to love me. I feel like at this point it’s so true. I’m always the second option. always. I wish I had that true genuine love that my ex gave her. I wish I was loved the same way I see people love. people use me, and they don’t even feel bad about it. 

I have absolutely no friends at all. I have nobody to talk to, my mind is always racing, I am always anxious. I’m so scared that I’m not lovable at the point to where I feel sick to my stomach, I get scared, I can barely sleep because I just think and think I used to be on sleeping meds but my anxiety about my heart is so bad I can’t even process going on meds to make me sleep, I wish life wasn’t so hard. I wish somebody cared about me, my ex would say he wasn’t ready for a relationship after she died, but then had sex with multiple girls, went to hang out with a girl after a day he kicked me out of his house. he ruined my life , not once but twice. This always happens to me. I never understand why, why would I live in the world where I’m never even going to be loved?  I wish I didn’t feel so crazy, I wish I I didn’t feel so fucking alone. I feel so empty literally empty can’t even describe how I feel I’m beyond feeling empty.

How am I supposed to live like this for the rest of my life,I (28F) am just a shell of a human. I literally wake up &amp; want to cry because I know the day ahead will just be torture. I used to have a combination of anxiety &amp; depression. The anxiety was worse. I was always overall in a down mood but able to function &amp; feel normal emotions. The anxiety slowly got better as my depression got so much worse. I’m pretty sure it’s because I just can’t care about anything anymore. I’m so numb. And the only emotion I do feel is deep deep sadness like in my bones sadness &amp; if you know that feeling I’m so sorry. I enjoy nothing. I have thoughts of ending it all pretty much daily. I have like 3 days that I’m okay every now and then &amp; feels like a weight has been lifted. Then I crash again for months. I don’t even want to have good days anymore. I don’t want to feel what I could feel every day if I had a normal brain. Because when the darkness comes back it’s just such a heartbreaking feeling. I’m drowning. I’m on Wellbutrin 300mg. It helps slightly. Like I can get through about half of the day feeling ok enough with it at least. I’m scared to try regular ssri’s bc I’m scared of gaining weight (I lost 100+ pounds years ago). The only thing that helps is “drugs” (stimulants/weed) but I feel myself developing a dependency &amp; every time I take an adderall or vyvanse I get such a deep feeling of guilt. Because I don’t want to be this way I just want to feel normal. I feel myself just falling more and more into a very deep whole and idk how to get out. The way I feel just makes me want to literally rip my soul out of my body. It’s just so unbearably uncomfortable feeling like this. I hate it so much and idk how to get better.

Feeling sadness when supposed to receive a reward,"Hello everybody,
First time I write here. Like you I suffer from depression. I am off medication now bc it didn't work.
Since my depressive episode, I have something weird which is happening. When I am supposed to feel pleasure during an event, I rather feel sadness and blunting.....
This started like one year ago. When I date a girl, when I buy a ticket flight for holidays, when I buy something I love I just feel empty and sad. A sadness which looks like feeling guilty too.

I dont know if it is because of the previous drug (escitalopram) or just the depression. This episode started 3 months after being off this drug. 

I am completely unable to feel pleasure. Sexual pleasure is dead for example.
When I try to masturbate for example and I try to feel some pleasure I just stay blank....

WTF is that? How is this possible?

Feeling Miserable and Stuck—Need Advice and Support,"Hi everyone,

I’m a 40-year-old woman and have been feeling miserable for the past four years. My psychologist recently used that term to describe my state, and it hit hard. I’ve been working on call at a Canada Post warehouse since November 2023, but there are barely any hours, and the work itself gives me existential dread. The job feels robotic, and commuting to the warehouse in the middle of nowhere depresses me further.

I’ve tried other jobs in the private sector, which had more interesting tasks, but they paid poorly and had terrible management. I even went back to college to study horticulture, hoping to work outdoors, but that didn’t pan out either. The physical labor was extreme, and it wasn’t what I had envisioned.

I moved back to my apartment recently, feeling more isolated than ever. I have no friends and no real job or career, just the Canada Post gig. I’ve been sending out resumes and getting interviews, but they rarely lead anywhere, and I’m left overthinking my answers. I recently bombed an interview for a job I’ve done for seven years and was great at.

I also volunteer in exchange for an art studio space that I never use and am considering giving up. The only thing bringing me joy right now is a baby squirrel I found in the spring, but even that worries me as I integrate him back into the environment.

My psychiatrist doesn’t seem to understand me, saying my life is “chaos” and that I don’t need meds. I don’t feel chaotic; I feel stuck and exhausted. I’ve tried to do things I used to enjoy—improv, jogging, yoga—but they don’t bring me joy anymore. I’m socially phobic and tired of making small talk or trying to build relationships.

My psychologist says I’m miserable, and I agree, but I don’t know how to get out of this. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you cope or find a way out?

about 3-4 days ago my parents suggested ι try going for α bit without the pills to see how ι manage (ι don't get averse side effects to new prescriptions/dose changes so it would measure my actual mental health status) and if ι can be okay without the happy medicine. currently ι take 3 different meds with 2 at their max doses (the 3rd is α sleeping pill). ι take them all daily so you can imagine the expenses even after insurance.

the suggestion came up because we're pretty strapped for money right now and for α couple days prior ι had forgotten to take my meds (we were on vacation and didn't bring them). ι agreed to try this and promised to let them know if ι wanted to start taking them again.

the issue is, for the past 5-6 days ι have been. Bad. if there was something stronger than α capital letter for Bad then ι would use that.

* ι have sensory issues, and lately my senses have been way more alert than usual
     * ι get overestimated much easier and have more trouble hiding it

+ ι'm always in α bad mood and say mean/snarky things to people or ignore them completely

* ι cry SO MUCH all the time every day and ι can't stop
     * before ι started antidepressants ι was on α real record-breaker of α depressive roll, years and years of the numb goodness that we all know and wallow in here, with α nice complete mental breakdown every now and then to spice things up. but immediately off the meds ι am far from numb, instead ι am full full FULL of sadness and anger and grief and pain so much pain that just. won't go away

+ i'm remembering all the Things^TM and ι keep messing things up, yadda yadda yadda you know the drill

it's like ι immediately slipped back and am now going through the worst of my depressive days to make up for the time ι missed by being mentally healthy on meds

but ι just am so embarrassed at the whole situation that I'm scared to say ι need to go back on the meds. ι really want to, ι mean ι hate feeling and living this way and the meds would get me on the road to fixing it, but it's been like 4 days and ι never had any withdrawal symptoms, the only issue is my stupid brain being stupid.

ι thought about just taking them in secret to fix the problem without having to admit it exists in the first place, but ι don't trust myself to do that. ι was majorly &gt;! sewerslidal !&lt; for α while, which has since turned to passive &gt;! sewerslidal!&lt;-ness (plan and shit but for α fixed later date (not relevant)) but it's coming back Strong now.

ι not gonna go into specifics but the melange of quick overstimulation, shitty attitude, horrible mental state, and the way it all manifests itself as physical pain as well, makes me really ashamed and guilty bc ι am letting the stuff that's always hurt me start hurting other ppl too just because ι stopped giving myself the princess treatment for α bit. and ι feel like just going back to taking the normal dose of meds won't be enough, ι want to take More.

ι don't wanna &gt;! kay em ess !&lt; with them but ι want minor &gt;! overdose !&lt; and unfortunately ι know the safe-to-unsafe-territory dose mark and ι don't trust myself not to cross it.

ι dont know what to do bc ι feel Awful^TM but the whole situation + my reactions are so childish and small compared to how things were when ι was at my worst and it's all being brought on bc ι stopped taking some pills. the whole thing feels like I'm overreacting but everything hurts so much more than I'm used to since I've been taking the meds for so long.

to make matters worse, my mother noticed ι was ""off"" and kept asking what was wrong and she was so concerned for me and asked if she could stay with me for α bit and told me to find her Immediately if ι need anything but ι just brushed her off the whole time and said ι am fine. but she is 100% correct and ι don't know why ι can't admit it to her. she literally asked if ι wanted to start taking my pills again and ι said no. ι don't know why ι was so dumb as to day no. but for some reason ι can't say yes.

but ι need to find α way to say yes bc that's the only way things are gonna get better (which ι hate saying bc it doesn't feel like things are really even ""bad"" now considering it's only been 6 days of this).

ι don't know how to do this but ι know ι need to do something. I'm hoping υ guys can help convince the dumb part of my mind that's against this to do the not-dumb thing and just admit my weakness. idk. I'm at α loss honestly. it's been no time at all yet I'm already too tired to be able to do this myself.

Tl;Dr: I'm off my meds and feeling awful but can't work up the courage to ask to go back on them again

I’m afraid I’m gonna kill myslef,"I'm drunk right now. I'm only 15. I'm retarted so Donny minds the grammar. I just told my homies while drunk that I'm fucked up in my head. I just told my crush that I'm fucked up. My best friend said he loves me and that I'm like a brother to him. I guess I like that. My crush has no interest in me other than being friends, and even then I might be below that. I love her so much. I understand that I have so much time but I dit feel like that. My brother died a few years ago and a I miss him so much. I like attention and I lie to make me feel better and more cared for. This is real tho. I feel like I'm meant to be a failure cuz everybody in my family is. My dad doesn't spend time with me and he lives somewhere else. I miss him too. My brother is an addict and every few months I see him I feel sick to my stomach. He is so skinny and deathly looking. I feel bad for my mom cuz she basically lost two sons already. I would have killed myslef already if it wasn't for her. I don't want her to feel bad. My crush is perfect and I'm not I'm fat and ugly. She's so nice but not interested. I want to marry her and have kids. I think this even tho we barely know each other. I guess that tells just how loneny I Sam. The only reason I am writhing this is beacae she leaving me on dilivered. I saw this video on twitter ir this girl sucking dick. She was beautiful. The only thought they arises my mind is that I will never have that. I will never get th girl. My brother was amazing. The coolest person ever. I miss him so much. I miss my dad too. There's this other girl as well. I'm only grade 9. She is in grade 12. She's very short. She looks same age as me.

"Nearing 40, Life Feels Hopeless","I’ve accomplished things, worked hard, travelled, seen a lot. University degree, military veteran of two countries, been in combat, worked in various fields, been to 24 countries, 41 states, journeyman tradesmen. I often get told I’m handsome. Still in pretty great shape for my age. I have many good friends. I volunteer. I have hobbies. It’s not as if I’ve been getting high in my mom’s basement this whole time. 

But depression and anxiety have plagued me my entire adult life. Now I also have PTSD. A botched surgery and it’s aftermath have destroyed my career. I had to move back in with my parents to save money. I wanted a partner and a life of my own, but instead I feel alone, like a pariah. Women want nothing to do with a man in his late 30’s who lives with his folks, regardless of his backstory, and I don’t blame them.  I tried to check all the boxes but I’m right back where I started. It’s devastating. I spend my days wandering, waiting for the next doctor’s appointment and therapy session. I don’t see an incentive to keep trying. I’ll sometimes see couples and parents my age and I want to cry. I see homeless people and think that’s my future.

Has anybody else been here before? How did you handle it?

Mentally drained,"There’s so much personal stuff going on, idk where to start. I’m trying to do better and be there for my family but sometimes I wish I was dead. Just, suddenly die. Never attempted but the intrusive thoughts linger. 

Work a dead end, high paying job. Trying to balance life and I fall into a circle of depression. I have not given therapy a full chance, however, it’s been rough physically and mentally where even the thought of “thinking” to force myself to shower is hard. 

I’m so, so, SO tired. Every fucking day. Tired of it all. Worried about my kids, my bi-polar/ psychotic wife (she’s on meds), battling boomer parents while I support literally 6 people; I’m burnt the fuck out. Idk what to do.

I don't know what to do anymore,"I always try and do the right thing but I'm just stuck. I'm always stuck in the same place of trying to make other people happy. I don't even know what would make me happy. I started to slowly close in on myself and talk to less people because i feel like no matter what I try to do I always end up hurting someone. The forst semester of this past year I was so happy and I felt like I was doing everything so well and everyone was so happy. Then more recently one of my friends that I had considered one of my closest friends said I had been horrible and I was a selfish, lying, bitch and I didn't understand it. I asked my best friend and she said she isn't sure where the lying was from because she didn't know anything of it nor do I even remember anything of it. I just wanna die so bad. But even my death will be a burden to others and my life is a burden to others. I just don't know what to do. Ice been trying to go to therapy but none of the meds are working and I just got put on a new one. I just don't know how to counter that. It feels like no matter what I try my happiness will always be a burden to other people. I just want to be happy but no matter what I try to do my happiness always makes someone angry at me. I used to be so outgoing I loved meeting new people and talking to people but now I fear it. I have no idea what they can do to me and if they'll hurt me and I feel like all I'll do is hurt them. I've never been an anxious person nor thought I was anxious until I talked to my therapist and she was like ""you definitely have anxiety"". I was thinking about it but then I kept thinking I never stop thinking I can't do anything and I don't know what to do I feel like my entire life has abandoned me.",LookLower3477,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1czlt/i_dont_know_what_to_do_anymore/
Struggling with the idea of therapy ,"To premise, I used to be very depressed and am getting better. However, I still have that lingering sadness when I go to bed. But I’m pretty happy nowadays. 

I’m ready to get over this. But therapy just feels wrong to me. I also won’t take medicine. I used to, and I just won’t anymore. 

Therapy feels unnatural. It makes me feel like I need a medicine man to come in and trick me into feeling better. I like having my friends and family cheer me up when I tell them how I really feel sometimes and talk me through it. Just genuine conversations. However, it doesn’t fully work. I think therapy makes me address that something is fully wrong with me. Makes me feel weak. I struggle with feeling weak as a young man. I would struggle to tell people I’m in therapy. My mother has also had extensive therapy and has had severe mental health issues. It scares me. Addressing similar issues in myself at a therapist scares me. Makes me feel like I’m crazy

Would love any advice or your story. Anyone that has felt similar, how do you feel about it now? Thank you ",SuggestionFrosty6291,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1970q/struggling_with_the_idea_of_therapy/

I'm so sick of my pathetic life: I Can Never Get What I Want!,"I know that life isn't fair but sometimes it fills like I pissed off some God or something. There are many disappointments and failed attempts in my life. The latest one was I was gonna have a free weekend to myself. I need my space and I wanted some alone time but of course that gets taken away from me. I am burnt out from work. I live in a small apartment with my significant other who I love but can be overwhelming. I was gonna pet sit for my dad while he was away on a trip. I was gonna have my parents house all to myself basically cause my mom was gonna have her own time to herself. I called yesterday to confirm plans since I was supposed to be there today and of course of course of course! The trip gets cancelled. I was looking forward to the time and worse I go to work yesterday after getting this news and it was the most hectic day that I had in a long time. I felt like my mind had been ripped to shreds and I was walking to my car like someone had rung me dry like a towel. I drove home in complete silence. Ive had many days like this, then my partner comes up to me asking a bunch of questions when I get home. I just need a minute please. I love my partner but it's just so overwhelming. I once had dreams and goals and everyday that passes I just get further and further away from what I truly want. My whole life has just been for other people, other jobs. I just wanted time and space just for me and this weekend would've been just for me and a good way just to recharge. I am a dead person walking around everyday still having to fake smiles and laughs. I just wanna be left alone. Then the ironic thing is I am alone. I am alone in my own feelings. I have to constantly suffer every day both mentally and physically with my bad back and bad knees and I'm not young but still not very old. I am too young for these kinds of problems. I work and do for everyone else but when I wanna do for me and  I can't and never get the time to. Only space I have is right now at 4am when my partner and the rest of the world is still sleeping. I get irrationally irritated on the occasion that my partner wakes up earlier than usual because this is my only time I have to myself before I have to start performing for other people. I really needed that damn weekend and of course it was taken away from me. I don't have the money to get a hotel like I used to so using my parents house was gonna be nice and a free choice to have but now it's business as usual.

Wish my dad had reacted a little different when I first started self-harming.,"I ""started"" when I was a *lot* younger (younger than 10 the very first time, I believe), but back then, it was more a fascination with blades and a sort of ""manic"" desire to see blood.

Need to feel something,"(I am 17M) For the last two years i have been struggling  and now I actually have no idea what to do. I just haven't felt anything since i turned 15, I just don't feel any joy anymore. I can't say that my family don't care about me - no, they are always kind and they did everything they could to bring me happiness as long as i remember myself. I truly love them, and that's kind of the only thing that stops me from, well, yeah. I try to act like everything is alright, and from anybody else's perspective my life is extremely good in comparison to most other teenagers in my country, but i just can't feel all that. I have nobody to talk to, as my parents and family put EVERYTHING they had on me, I am their whole life and i feel like if i tell them about this they might fall into the state that i am right now (and for the same reson i can't ask for help from the school therapist or anything like that). My ""friends"" think that i am living much better life than they do, and they will not take it seriously, because i always seem so happy and joke around 99% of the time, I said so many times to them that i need help and that i might do something bad to myself but they think those are just jokes. Truth is, i WANT to succeed in life, and more, i KNOW that i can do that. But the state I am in right now is just stopping me, I feel like I am waisting my life when i know that i can become a great man and that this is just stopping me from that. I want to exceed my family's expectations and my own too. I think i need someone, someone that could guide me or help me or something but i just don't know where to find someone like that, and i definitely don't want to tell this to my family. It is such a strange feeling - at the same time i feel like i can do anything i want and i will be the greates person at doing that something while at the same time feeling nothing and wanting to do nothing.

"I'm depressed but nobody understands how depressed, now I'm getting worse","I, 15F, have struggled with depression for 4 years now. I want to try and get out by staying positive and making myself shower as I have not been able to do proper hygiene. My life used to be shit and now it's great. My dad loves me, I have a great girl I'm talking to and I have a few friends by my side. For some reason though, today was worse. I spent most of the day drawing like usual, I called with my girl for a while and I was smiling and laughing. The moment my girl went to sleep though, that's when everything went downhill.

I live with my two sisters, the younger one is 12, the older is 18. I'm turning 16, youngest will be 13, and oldest will be 19. My two sisters are very close birthday wise. 5 days apart, and they got very close since my younger sister isn't mentally unstable. She's never had depression or anxiety from my knowledge, she's just never been mentally ill. My older sister used to be unstable and it made her do dumb things she regrets now. But she still doesn't understand me. 

After my girl went to sleep, I started watching my favorite show ""One Day At a Time"" since it talks about serious topics that I closely relate to. My older sister has a baby and brought her down stairs. Where I currently was, and my little sister tagged along. They both disliked the show since they thought the acting was terrible and they didn't understand the emotion and meaning behind everything. I'm not sure what my sister said but I remember responding with the fact she doesn't know a lot about mental health for someone who went to a psych ward. It's true, she doesn't understand depression on a deep level, she doesn't understand why I'm the way I am, why I don't want her around for my sweet 16. I can explain that in another post. 

We started arguing and I kept telling her just because I'm breathing doesn't mean I'm healthy. People died healthy. Then I told her how depression really hurts someone, it makes me sit in my bed for weeks rotting. I lose motivation for anything I love for weeks, and she said it was my phone. She doesn't understand that my phone is the reason I'm still alive. I have connections with people around the US who help me so much, without those connections I cry and sleep all day. That's not the worst of it though, my sisters always judge me for not having a job despite the fact I quit for my health since I have seizures and cerebral palsy. After my argument with my sisters I just went silent abd headed to my room to cry. And then I got on roblox, I like to play it when I'm upset and laugh at things. But, some random girl had told me she hopes I get sa'd and pregnant and die. I genuinely didn't even say anything rude to her.

After that I got off, I just can't anymore. What did I do? Why is everyone trying to make me more sad? I don't want to kill myself but I really really do. ",Fabulous-Presence-37,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1b9ej/im_depressed_but_nobody_understands_how_depressed/

Something I wrote 20mins ago,"If I'm breaking a rule, please let me know, I will take this down. 

The following is a script I just wrote, maybe I just need to vent, but I'll appreciate any comment that you may want to leave there. 

「Content Warning (probably abuse? Idk)

___

So I've been meaning to do something like this years ago, but never had the courage to do it. Maybe one day I'll do it, but as for now, I'll do this. 

I'll start telling my most recent experience while being on a family trip to an hotel at a beach. (today) 

___

I've been having trouble sleeping for the whole trip, mostly due to anxiety while sleeping. I've been moving a lot while sleeping, not being able to rest, and feeling awful when I wake up.

I wake up Anxious, agitated, and dont feel any peace at all.

At the moment Im writting this, its my second and last night at the hotel,and honestly, I dont want to sleep at all.

Im (M22) currently sleeping on the same bed as my mother (F40ish), and dont feel calmed doing that.

I'm currently on a trip with my mother,and other family members, they are in one room, and Im with my mother in the other one.

We are not of the best resources, so I can understand why we are using just two rooms between the 4 adults and 2 kids we are.

It is just a luxury for us to be here. Maybe Im being entitled by feeling this way.

Alongside the whole trip, I'm the oldest of the cousins, so it is expected of me to take care of them.

Honestly I keep saying that I am enjoying this trip, while honestly I'm not.

It is not exactly due to me not being free to enjoy my vacations by taking care of my family, but it is mostly due to my mother being too much over me. 

She has always been that way, and I can kind of understand.

I'm an only son, and since I have memories, she's been always overprotective of me.

It makes sense, she lost her firstborn son at birth. So after many years of trying, I was what she was left with. 

I understand she wants to take care of me, and only wants the best for me. I love her, but I feel overwhelmed due to it. 

I can't speak of it with her, believe me, I've tried, only to make things worse.

I joke with her, play along, and share a lot of things with her. But I feel like a prisoner not being able to do things on my own without her checking every step I take. 

I only learned to take public transportation until I was 18y/o and that shows how little I know about stuff.

I know the world is scary and dangerous. And at any moment, I can get killed or something where I currently live. But I can't just see the negative stuff in life, if not, I won't enjoy it. 

Things that make it worse, it is the I have OCD (diagnosed) and am gay at a fully homophobic country, and where no one cares about mental health. I'm over exaggerating, but it feels like living hell. 

Those are my secrets... Even to my family and friends.

I've only told my 2 best friends, their reaction were ""As long as it is not with me, there's no issue"" and ""Okay, I understand and support you, but I only see you being with a girl""

I don't touch the topic with them anymore.

To the people I've met, I've always been the ""good kid/young adult"" while I know I'm not that.

And I won't even get started with the religious issues I have... 

I think I'm scared to fully be me, and don't feel capable of being what I want to be. Ha, I'll go to hell if I do that.

At least not for now, it is not the moment to do so. I plan to finish studying, get out of the country, and hopefully, I won't be followed around.

I love them so much, but can't be myself, and I feel un capable to do stuff without my family.

Maybe, actually, not maybe. I am naive, trying to learn this world on my own. And not having the guide to do so, while learning and acting like myself.

It's 12:30 post midnight, and I'm on the verge of crying while writing this script, I'm sitting on the floor of the bathroom with only a thin door dividing me from my mother and I'm sure she's already suspicious something is going on.

Maybe I just needed to vent. Hope everything goes alright. At least the sea outside kind of calms me down. Good night.」

I'm currently posting this on a throwaway account, but if I feel like it, I'll do something with it in a main account. Again, thanks for being there. ",ComfortHopeful186,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e1b2vt/something_i_wrote_20mins_ago/

I can’t even tell if I’m faking it or not. I used to have this horrible attention seeking attitude when i was younger but my family was kinda shitty to me. I’m just scared i’m doing that again but i don’t feel like i am because i don’t even talk about it.

First... I literally messaged because I have no one who I can rely on (which I shared with them) and they also showed me that yep.... I  have no one I can rely on.

"Most people don’t need therapy, they need a better life.","Therapy doesn’t actually solve any problems, it can help people who are already in a good position realize what they have but if you already have a shitty life, no amount of therapy will un-shitty your life. The problem is solutions to mental health have been offloaded to the individual, instead of fixing the problem therapists train you to seem like you don’t have a problem.

Because the problem 9/10 times is that you are chained to a job or position that forces you to do unhealthy behaviors. You eat fast food because you work 12 hour shifts and don’t have time or energy to cook a good dinner. Or that you have no meaningful connections to anybody because there are no places to make those connections. You are stressed because your job is stressful.

Unless you make above 100k a year this is just reality for you, you can’t just “take a break” or anything like that because then you’d become homeless. Then we add the need to diet and exercise on top of constantly working overtime no wonder most people are fat. We never have time to focus on our health because our health is secondary to our work. If you are stressed, and go to a therapist about stress, most likely their advice is to do more stressful things to get you into a position where you have the resources you need.

But that’s not how humans work, you WILL fail because humans aren’t meant to plan out every second of their lives, every little bite of food and energy spent, we just don’t work like that. 

Because the urge to eat predates and overrides your prefrontal cortex. It controls the brain not the other way around.

But if you’re fat, suddenly people don’t want to talk to you. Suddenly you are persona non grata because you have been labeled as an invalid. People don’t say it but it’s true, if you have 2 people with identical job applications and one was obese and one was fit. Who do you think is getting the job? We discriminate because no matter how small the difference there is still only 1 job open. We discriminate because our system is discriminatory by structure.",Kekero63,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e0yvqk/most_people_dont_need_therapy_they_need_a_better/

on a lot of days he’ll lay in bed and be visibly upset and just down, and as somebody who has depression i get it but i just feel like im failing as a partner

he has an avoidant style of going thru things where as i seek communication immediately because i overthink like crazy, this clashes a lot and ive had to learn patience because i feel like talking things immediately with him just makes him feel worse,

"22 M, I’m a fucking failure","
Im 100% going to kill myself soon I’m genuinely a complete fucking failure. It’s honestly sad that I’m hitting this realization this late in life, but it is what it is. I remember that starting from 16, I began getting depressed because of the overwhelming stress of keeping a high gpa, getting into a good college, and studying for the SAT. I had a close friend group in hs (probably the only rzn I’m still alive to this day) and during that time I would just cope by hanging out w them or making music at home. I talked to almost no girls in hs because I simply didn’t care to. Before I knew it, it was 2020 and I was graduating. Then Covid happened and I started losing my mind even more since we lost the end of our senior yr + first yr of college. Since I’m a cs major I basically got into 0 colleges that I wanted and was forced to go to a lower tier uc. My gc w my friends was very active during the quarantine and we’d do stuff, but deep down I knew my college experience was alr scuffed in multiple ways. Then in the end of 2021 I finally went to college, but I got fucked over and was forced to take off campus housing w some of my hs friends. That made it super hard to meet people so we all just ended up sending out transfer apps to try and get out. Fast forward to 2022 and I transferred to a slightly better uc w the hopes of saving my life. Met a couple close friends there, but at the end of the day I didn’t make the best of the experience at all. I kinda just became one of those “locked in” dudes and spent all my time at the gym, playing basketball, or grinding classes/interview prep/resume projects. Especially in 2023-2024 my mental health took a huge dip and I was struggling to do everything. Now I have a 6 figure full time job as a swe, but I’m realizing that it doesn’t fucking matter and that life is gonna be super fucking boring from now on. I wasted 18-21 grinding for a physique + high paying job when I should have been having fun and living it up. I also never dated during this time period and I’m pretty much cooked now having to rely on apps and shit. 

Only reason I haven’t killed myself already is because my hs friends are all back and we been hanging out hella. Also my mom finding my body is a mental block, but I think I’m ready to get over it.",Vast_Meringue6170,35,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e0ks5o/22_m_im_a_fucking_failure/

A temple of time and a testament to the infinity of life.What’s it doing right now? Being poisoned,wasted,withered away. The universe is the factory of life,and I am the faulty outcome. I’m A blunder of creation.  I would be doing the universe a service, to die. My soul would be free, the pure parts remaining would not be tethered to my failed mind and body. My soul could go on,reincarnate to life hundreds of more lifes, as its lived 100s of more lives before me. My physical body,would  rot away and the nutrients would  be restored to the earth.  It would allow new beauty to sprout, the stardust of the ancients being repurposed into grander projects of beauty. I would be a small blib, a blunder to be forgotten  Before my soul could have been in an ancient warrior, a mighty redwood tree, a resilient butterfly, a wise crafter. I am a failure in the lineage of my soul. I should set the motion right and return my soul and my physical matter back to creating  beauty to the world.

Depression is rearing its ugly head again,"I had depression and was diagnosed 8 years ago. I was sheltered growing up and as soon as I got out in the real world I immediately felt like a failure. Got a job at 18? Should've had one at 15. Going to college for a degree? Should have already started working in related fields. Stepping away from Christianity? You're going to hell. Dating someone? Should've dated someone more responsible and rich. There was always a ""You could do better"" undertone to everything I did or tried. It was a lot to take in all at once and on all fronts. Religion, relationships, education, career, etc.

Fast forward 5-6 years, I finally felt like the weight was gone. I worked on finding myself and figuring out what I wanted instead of keeping up with what everyone else seemed to want for me. Made mistakes and had successes. I don't regret anything. I felt like I was finally ready to spread my wings and fly. This feeling didn't last but was a nice breath of fresh air.

Fast forward another 1-2 years. My grandmother passed away. I was falling apart at the seams grieving her. Everything was fine I thought. Turns out things just shifted. During the ""high"" I went through I was robbed and held at gunpoint. I was dealing with trauma but kept suppressing it. It took my grandmother's passing to force me to see the ptsd I developed nearly 2 years after it happened. Everything fell apart. I couldn't maintain my job anymore. I had frequent panic attacks. I couldn't sleep. I couldn't calm down enough to focus on my job. It was all building up over 2 years and finally boiled over with the loss of my grandma.

Fast forward to today? I still can't hold a job. I still deal with panic attacks but not near as frequent. I've been on medication and got off of it this spring. I finally think I am stabilizing again, just to realize how damn depressed I am. Is it because I've been off of meds? Or is it because life is just impossible to get back up from? I have no clue I just know this feeling and don't miss it.

I guess the biggest thing I wanted to share is, despite going through this again, there is in fact a light at the end. There is hope. For the most part it's a matter of figuring out what the problem is then fixing it. That takes time and work. But. There is an end to it. Going through depression again really sucks but I feel more in control this time. I know what's on the other side and I know I can get there. Hell, i did it once before right? This is for anyone struggling and feeling like there is no end. Yes there is. There will always be an end to the big sad. The biggest thing that needs to take place is finding what you can control and what about it is making life worse than it should be. Hold on dear friend. If I could make it so can you. Shit we can go through this together now that I've come full circle. That doesn't always happen either. You may get more lucky than I've been. I want that for you 🖤",drumstyx-98,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e19dxp/depression_is_rearing_its_ugly_head_again/
How to be more present,"My partner has told me that there were times I wasn’t really there or present. We are about to move and I’m having a lot of anxiety and second thoughts. Their rebuttal was what’s different now than then? The things I want to do, live life and decorate my apartment and feel cozy in it- why couldn’t I do that before? My partner says I could have but I just wasn’t there I was too busy being in my own world dealing with myself and my depression. I hate this so much that I’ve let them feel alone and like I was there but not really there. I also don’t know how to fix myself. How to not let things affect me. How to not let things affect me after years of time. I don’t want to be like this. I don’t choose to be like this. But I do know my neurodivergence and diagnosis is different than my partner’s, we’re built different, we handle things differently- they are so much stronger than myself.

My life. ,"My life started the same as anyone, doing drugs, like e and cocaine, but grew out of it, and now I just smoke weed. When , I was 22-23 I’m now 40. I was happy, experimenting, friends, girlfriend. Then my lack of being a great sexual partner, P.E , became a reason why two people madly in love broke up. She was young and realized that commitment, she could never possibly have been fucked, like her friends were, she ended it. 100% understand. But shortly after, I was in an accident, the driver was drunk , I was in passenger seat, and my best friend was in the back. He dies we survived. So I had heartbreak, resulting in something I couldn’t control, then had a friend die, that I couldn’t control. Afterwords I became a drunk, I became a loner, didn’t want to face what had happened [social anxiety] . So I drank alone for close to 15 years, I got sick, had a liver transplant. Now I’m 40 not a drunk , but still think about the accident and how I got left by someone IN love with me, because of the PE thing. I’m scared to try and start a relationship, first of all, I’m on disability now, 2nd I have a massive gross hernia, from the surgery. So I fear, even online dating, I could face rejection, either from how I look, [hernia] or how I might preform. What the fuck should I do. All I can think about is the past. The only thing , I can think of to cope is alcohol. It’s obviously ptsd from the accident and fear of rejection, basically telling me to not bother, but I do want a relationship, I do want kids. I’m 40 now, I haven’t had sex in 15 years. I’m so afraid of depressing myself further, that I don’t want to risk it.

I'm almost hitting 18 and I think life would be easier if I committed.,"im a 17 year old autistic person who has been living a relatively shitty life. my parents used ""sugar"" when i was 10 which caused my mom to die around in 2016. as soon as i got to live with my grandparents i was heavily babied through my life until i got to live with my dad which gave me a harder time to learn simple things such as basic chores. i had struggle learning everything and as soon as my dad got a girlfriend, i was getting worse.

my stepmom is incredibly abusive, doesnt understand me and thinks im a dumbass. i got into academic pressure due to her forcibly making me go into scholarship programs and screaming threats at me if i made a singular B on my grade. she tried to get me to jobs, and which i did but every single one of them declined. i tried my best during interviews, nothing.

i hated living in the city where i was at solely because of her and also i was bullied alot in school. i was too open about myself and fucked up since i was talking about my interests and i was wearing t-shirts of said, interests. i'm now moved to a town, which isnt bad but its much harder for me to get a job.

she teases me about me living with my parents until im 30 or that im gonna be so lazy that i cant do anything, im hitting 18 around in august 17 but i feel like im a failure. every application denied me or the stupid fucking ""We'll give you a update"" message, people pick at me in school, i hug plushies even though im ""too old"", my brother is much more successful than i am, i can't tie shoes, i can't ride a bike, i act very immature for my age, i eat weirdly, i walk weirdly, ive never been taught on how to drive bc im too ""irresponsible"" for it, everyone treats me like im different because of my disability, etc.

How do I not ruin my relationship with my depression?,"I love my boyfriend but our relationship makes me miserable.

Before meeting him I had nobody I could even talk to casually- now I can talk to him about my feelings and absolutely anything, which is amazing and I am very grateful for him. But we are very different, and because of being around him all this time, I feel like all of my insecurities are constantly in my face. I still have 0 friends- people are friendly with me, but it's not like anybody would want to casually grab a coffe with me. Him on the other hand- he has so many good relationships in his life, it's crazy to me. I didn't think it was even possible. He has close friends he can have fun and cry with, has good relationship with his siblings and anybody that meets him wants to talk to him. He is extremely friendly and charismatic and can adapt to people easily. He's attractive and confident- and I'm constantly embarassed of everything that I do. I don't even post on social media because I feel like either nobody cares or they will make fun of how pathetic and unskilled I am. It's like he's living in creative mode, while I'm constantly overthinking every move. But I have nobody else. I try to reach out to people but it never works. And I'm not a people magnet like he is. I found myself being upset and jealous of his female friends often and feel insecure as I know that if we broke up he would go back to his tens of friends with benefits or any girl that is interested in him, and I would be all by myself. His friends like me but they are still his friends, and they like me exactly and only because of that.

I am in a relationship but I feel lonely all the time. And I don't want him to know that I am this insecure and jealous and pathetic. I already constantly wonder why he is even with me. I thought that being with someone like him would help with my self esteem but I feel the opposite. I feel unlikeable, boring and unattractive. I don't even feel like a person. I feel like I'm just there to observe him most of the time. I was depressed and lonely before, but it at least made sense then as I was kind of a shut in and it felt like there was nothing outside my room filled with my negative thoughts. Now I'm constantly slapped in the face with the reality of most people- with their own problems and all, but able to connect with each other and actually be alive. But I'm still just an observer, even in my own relationship and life and I can't help but cry every free evening that I have.

I hate how I feel now, but I don't want to go back to how it was in the years before. Maybe I will never feel fine, but I don't know how to control my feelings anymore. I've been on every possible antidepressant, on anti-anxiety medication, neuroleptics, mood stabilizers and ADHD medication and nothing helped. I can't afford therapy. I hate feeling like this but I am extremely scared of him leaving me, because I had nothing good in my life before he was in it and was s\*\*\*idal. I know it's not healthy but it seems like there is no way out of this + he might be the only person that actually cares about me. I am 28 and I've never had someone that would be so genuinely interested in how I feel about anything. Outside of that he's just a really kind, curious, genuine person and we have similar views, sense of humor and interests. I just don't know how to cope with all these negative feelings all the time and not sabotaging the relationship by being down and crying every time we see each other or being secretive and dishonest. I don't want him to know how insecure I am, this is not who he was attracted to and it's not ok for me to make him my therapist now. I already stopped speaking with him for a few days once because I was crying all day every day, and even though I told him I need a break because I'm stressed with whatever, he told me that he needs me to communicate and it made him very worried. I was so jealous and irritated by him not seeing how he's hurting me but at the same time felt so bad for him. In all of this, I think I hate myself the most.

TLDR: My relationship somehow lowered my self esteem even more and I am having conflicting feelings about the only person in the world that wants to see me.

Epidural Shot causing Depression,"My depression seems to have become worse for me after the shot.  Anyone ever heard of this?  I take meds for depression and anxiety to keep me from going suicidal and its almost like they had stopped working completely once I got the shot.  Was in a state of thinking it was better to die for 3 days after the shot and now I struggle to get out of bed and do normal daily things and its been 3 weeks almost since the shot to my low back.

I have crippling back pain which is what more or less caused the deperession to begin with. It was being taken care of with the anti depressants but its almost like they aren't doing anything now.  I go to see my doctor for my follow up soon and plan tell him about my depression getting worse as well as the shot not working which is kind of a bummer.  I also see my medicine checkup doctor shortly after him so I have to tell her about this as well.

Has anyone ever heard of a side effect like this?  I can't seem to find much information and I almost wonder if I am having some sorta bad reaction between my meds and the shot.",Mehpost,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e18awt/epidural_shot_causing_depression/
I hate confronting it.,"Every time I talk to someone and the topic of self harm comes up or loneliness I just break down. I guess I naturally started to get away from talking about it with people or avoiding actually thinking about how I feel. 

Everytime someone around me asks me how I’m doing and if I’m still doing things like that anymore which I’m not thankfully but I just can’t help but feel like by talking to them I’m then forcing myself to confront the issue instead of just running away from it.


I know it’s bad to avoid your problems but I’ve done that with most of my troubles in life and sometimes it would backfire but I’d eventually forget it and move on. Idk why it can’t be the same with this. Every friendship I make ends in flames the other person either leaves or turns out to be fake. I can’t even talk to my parents (I’m 17) as they have their own lives. 


I came across a game that had that as the main topic and I can’t stop thinking about how much the main character had similar feelings as me. She had the same mental health issues and similar personal problems. I just wish I could forget about depression and move on like I usually do with these kinds of issues. It’s terrible for me but it’s just blissful ignorance as they say.

Life is quite literally falling apart for me. I didn’t achieve the one goal I set for myself, I got something good yeah but it’s not “it”. Not to mention I’m starting university soon and I’m so lost. I have nobody. Absolutely nobody to help me with this.

idk what to do anymore,"i’m 18F. i lost my dad late december, 2023. my life hasn’t been the same since. i just need some place to put my emotions because i have never felt so lost before in my life. this isn’t even all of the bullshit that’s happened in the past 7 months, reddit is pissing me off with this delayed typing 😂

i grew up with my dad in my life, and id 100% be lying if i said he was the best dad growing up. unfortunately, he was a raging alcoholic, to the point where he was physically and mentally abusive to my family and i. my mom, at the time, was my rock. i was so scared of my dad back then. she would stand up to him and it would make me feel so safe. but she was only around for times like that. since my dad didn’t have a job, she worked endlessly to support all of us. she was always at work, and when she wasn’t at work, she was asleep. so a lot of the time, i had no one. i remember being woken up at 2 in the morning by my dad crashing into the house, and screaming at my mom until she grabbed my sibling and i and left. this continued on pretty consistently until i was in the 9th grade. he never stopped drinking, but he did manage to cut back to the point to where we never saw him drunk again. this is when things started to turn up. that’s when i learned who my real dad was. a hilarious, kind hearted man who would do anything in the world for the people he cared about. in high school, he never missed a game or a competition. i was in color guard/marching band and we had a few out of state competitions, and he showed up to every last one. to this day, my dad is the only person who truly believed that i could be something special. he saw me for me. he listened to me. and now he’s gone.

he passed while i was at a bowl game for my college( through the marching band). my best friend called me while we were on the way back from florida (where the bowl game was) and asked me what all the police were doing outside of my house. i couldn’t even process why they would be there. i was still 8 hours away from home and now on the brink of a panic attack. i didn’t hear from anyone again until 1 am. i cried myself to sleep because if i didn’t, i probably would’ve thrown up all over the place. no one noticed, or if they did notice, they didn’t care enough to see if i was ok.
i knew something was wrong when my grandma and my best friends mom were the ones to pick me up instead of my dad. that’s when my phone started ringing. i wish i would’ve  let it keep ringing, so i didn’t have to hear those words come out of my moms mouth. no matter how i play it out though, the result is always the same. my dad is gone. i’ll never see his face again, ill never get to hear him laugh again, ill never get to hear his terribly awful jokes again, he won’t be able to walk me down the isle, and he’ll never get to meet his future grandchildren. i feel like im going insane, i have mever felt so low in my life. i dropped out of college and im now over 20k in debt because of that. i dropped slll of my hobbies and skills. i pushed friends and family away from me. i push myself further and further from reality each day. some days i feel like it’s still march, and im surprised to see that it’s already july. i rot in my bed all alone all day. no one comes to check on me. i don’t remember the last time ive eaten more than once a day.i feel the people i didn’t push away leaving, im just not any fun to them anymore. i can’t even make conversation with the people im closest to anymore. i just sit in this agonizing trance, non blinking and silent, the only noise are my thoughts telling me that there’s nothing left for me in this world. i want to enjoy my life. i want to be happy , and wake up and be able to say that i want to live. i want to feel something other than anger. i want to love the skin im in. i want to be outgoing and have lots of friends that can remember the simple things about me. i want to live a life i can be proud of. it just doesn’t feel possible anymore.",Ecstatic_Jury5397,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e185o7/idk_what_to_do_anymore/

Sorry for the long post this is my first one ever but I don't know how to keep living like this.,"My only reason for still being here is because of my family and that I don't want to hurt them. I just have so much that I don't know how to work past. literally ever since I first I was able to remember things, I remember my mother beating and yelling at me. She has told me all through my life until I was 16 all kinds of things about how useless I am I can't do anything right. She'd stand over me and yell at me saying how much of an idiot I am, like even sweeping the floor was wrong to her. She would run around the house stomping and throwing things and yelling for hours. There was maybe three out of the 7 days a week where she maybe wouldn't hit us. She would throw me against walls and punch and slap and stomp on me for any reason except for school work and anything like that. I figure because that kind of thing didn't matter to her because she already only saw me as useless idiot. She drove away my father which wanted to be in my life but she wouldn't even let him and she'd play it off well enough and make us lie to people so that she could keep custody of us. The only reason it lasted until I was 16 was because when I was 12 she forced herself on me while my older sister was out of the house and years later I told my dad when I was 16 and he said he doesn't care what the court says I not living with her anymore. So he got me away from her but because I never made any friends I didn't know how to and in the new school I still couldn't make any friends. I started to feel more and more alone to the point where now, when I'm 20 years old, I'm used to the loneliness but I'm starting to hate it. I'm completely lost emotionally, I have a stable job, make enough money, but I have no idea how to live because of how I grew up. I only really know how to live the way she taught me to. I tried therapy for a bit and they told me that I need to get out to try to make friends so that won't feel so alone. But when I took time off my job go to this big city, every shop and store I saw I couldn't bring myself to go into it because I had no interest in anything. I just felt alone and depressed in a different city.

"Please, please help me. I’m struggling and I really need support ","*Disclaimer: I am not actively suicidal and I have no plans to end my life. Also, if you have anything against people that are still concerned about COVID, this post isn’t for you. 

I have been depressed for as long as I can remember and have been living with suicidal ideation since I was 14. 

I had a very traumatic childhood which included CSA, financial insecurity/homelessness, and so much more. 

I found solace in the arts. I’ve been performing since I was in high school and even attended a performing arts college. I held on to life for so long in the hopes of putting all my trauma behind me and becoming the successful performer that I’ve always dreamt of becoming.

That plan mostly went out the window when COVID started right after I graduated college. I’m immunocompromised, so being on a film set/doing theatre (especially after the entertainment industry stopped taking COVID precautions altogether) was out of the question once it set in that COVID was probably going to be around for a long time, if not forever. 

Performing was (and still is) really my passion and the only thing I was ever really interested in doing. Having to walk away from it because of an overall lack of precautions and care in the entertainment industry has sent me into an even deeper depression than I was experiencing pre-pandemic. The one career that I want doesn’t feel accessible to me anymore and it’s honestly devastated me more than any of my earlier traumas ever had. 

On top of all of that, my suicidal ideation is painfully persistent and comes at the worst possible times. I’m very hyper vigilant and I find myself having extreme suicidal thoughts whenever anyone is upset with me. I’m talking ready-to-end-it all-over-someone’s-tone-of-voice-changing level ideation. I’m genuinely afraid of how far these thoughts go sometimes and I don’t want to be like this anymore. I’m constantly battling my mind and I’m afraid I’ll lose this battle one day. My ideation is also triggered by financial stress/insecurity, which I’m also struggling with right now 

Like I said above, I’m not actively suicidal and I have no plans to end my life, but I’m definitely not happy to be here. I mean, I’ve accepted that my career isn’t all that accessible to me right now and that I’ll have to figure out a way to pursue my career safely if I really want to do it still, but my depression is so bad at the moment that hopelessness has almost completely eclipsed me. The world has almost completely lost its color in my eyes. When my ideation is at its worst, I often find myself thinking that I just want to be free and I don’t know if I’ll ever find the freedom I’m looking for on Earth. I know that this isn’t true and I want to try and get better so I can at least try to be happy, but I’m so depressed that I don’t even know where to start in fixing all of this. I’ve almost completely stopped taking care of myself. Keeping up with basic hygiene is very difficult for me and I only do that on days that I’m working. 


I want help, but I can’t afford it. I desperately want to go back to therapy and try medication, but my insurance is income-based and I will soon lose coverage because of the job that I just got and I can’t afford to pay for any care out of pocket right now. The job that I have right now is just a place holder and I plan on securing a higher paying job or two so that I can actually afford to get some help. 

My question is, what does one do if they want help but can’t afford it/don’t have much money to put towards treatment? Are there sliding scale programs in the US for cases like mine? I obviously can’t really get help right now, I’m just asking for help with pooling resources so I can come back to them when I have a little more disposable income to start treatment.

What am I even supposed to do in this situation? I can’t go on like this forever. My mind is holding be back and I know it ",ThisIthForRachel,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e0y4f9/please_please_help_me_im_struggling_and_i_really/

Im tired of not being left alone by people who want to see my career destroyed so they make up lies about me, lies that could actually get me hurt. Im tired of being judged by fucking losers with nothing better to do with their lives. Im tired of dealing with my mothers bullshit.

I don’t know how I feel,"My whole life, as long as I can remember i’ve wanted to die. I didn’t get the point of life, I still don’t really but I also don’t want to die. I feel it’s always too messy and selfish. I wouldn’t want anyone around me to commit, so how could I do that to anyone else? Now I just feel nothing all the time. Sometimes at work I feel what I think is joy, but I also think it’s just the only time i’m not alone. The only time I can talk to people who don’t know my home life and don’t judge me.

 I feel like a completely different person from 4 years ago. I always felt suicidal and would constantly self harm. Every time I felt sad, which was everyday, I felt like I had to hurt myself to stop the emotional pain. That if I didn’t I would end it all and I just couldn’t do that to my family. I don’t really like my family but still… I feel nothing about anything now. I don’t feel happy i don’t feel sad. I just feel numb. 

I feel like no one really cares how I feel. Which is how life goes but it still sucks. No one can tell i’m never happy. They ask if im sad but not if im happy. and truthfully i don’t think im sad. just so indifferent about everything and anything. it hurts tbh. i want to be happy or even sad. i just feel nothing. but i want to hurt myself. i want to feel something. idk what to do.  

i don’t feel like i can truly talk to people about it. i don’t like my family and i was just put in the hospital when i talked about it before. I love my boyfriend but i don’t think it’s worth taking to him about it. He already thinks im sad all the time and idk how to explain im not. i’ve tried i just dont do a good job. i’m just not happy and i feel nothing. I just want to feel something.

My (33m) partners (34f) mood swings are really affecting me...,"So my partner's mood swings and depression have been affecting my mental health and need some advice what to do? So we have been together 4 years and are getting married in a month, and recently her mood and depression has been all over the place, like one minute she's all lovey and sucky then the next she's in a spiral of depression and drinking a full bottle of wine a night. Now I'm trying to be a good partner and help her through it, but it doesn't seem to be working and then her frustration gets taking out on me.
 
For example she's been getting really down about her career, she has a degree, 2 Masters and a PHD in music but she's working as a cook, so she thinks she's useless as she can't get a job in the career she's studied in and we rent so she thinks we've failed in life and everyday is another failure. I try and reassure her that it's not for ever and something will come along, and we have a steady wage and a roof over our heads. But this doesn't do anything and she gets into more of a state usually followed by drinking, like she drank some really really fancy wine we got bought as a present for the two of us, I only noticed the next day as the bottle was in the recycling. And she takes it out on me too, like I went to bed early as I was tired and she was storming around making comments about me, I was pretending I was sleeping, so not getting a reaction from me was making her worse. But I just don't want to get in an argument with her over nothing, she started saying stuff about my family as she thinks they hate her (they don't) and I had to really bite my tongue and not say anything and continue to pretend I was asleep.
 
And then the next day after a night of sleep and sobering up she's all apologetic for the way she is.and her temper, and I tell her not to apologize for being depressed and try to reassure her that are current situation isn't going to be for ever. But then it's just rinse and repeat and it's been happening more and more, normally it would happen maybe a handful of times a month, now it's weekly. It's really affecting me and.my mental health, I really love her and hate seeing her beat herself up so much, I just don't know what to do or say, as when I try and bring it up she normally deflects and is like ""oh poor you, you don't have it near as bad"" and then blows up, and says a professional is too expensive and she's had bad experiences in the past with them.

Was it depression? ,"Around some time in 2021, I was peacefully scrolling on my laptop in bed when I suddenly heard a weird feeling inside my chest. Like a quick surge of heat, almost like an electric shock. And no, it wasn't physical, rather mental. I felt it but it did not originate from a physical occurrence. At first I was in complete shock and confusion. Just wtf was that? It happens for the second time but I'm still confused. 3rd Time still consufed. Later that day, this feeling stays and I'm suffering very bad. I'm experiencing chills, I feel like my heart is on fire, I start hating everything that is around me, suddenly I don't feel like doing anything anymore, everything is pointless, I feel very weak both physically and mentally. I tell myself that this is just a random feeling and I will wake up tomorow and it'll be gone. Guess what, first thing in the morning I directly feel the same way again. Like no joke. Not even a second I feel like it never left me. Days go by and I begin to absolutely lose it, I feel hopeless, enraged, confused, anxious, suicidal, unmotivated. This is when I start developing my addiction of masturbation in order to escape this feeling but no matter what I did, it never went away. One night the pain inside my chest was SO BAD I started crying and begging to get rid of it. A lot of times I felt like vomiting. This feeling changed my mood to ""eveyrthing is worthless die"" while giving me some type of horrid pain inside my chest. After living like this for 6 months, I managed to ignore it and that's how I forgot about it. Pretty much came back sometimes but I knew how I could stop it. And yes it's still present in me, in fact I felt it while writing this. I just hope it never gets to the wheel again because if it does I'm gone for good",Relevant_Jury_9834,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e131ax/was_it_depression/
Darkness Cover Me ,"A poem I wrote about how I am currently feeling. 

Oh darkness cover me 
If the bed of misery is a comfort 
for fools so will I sleep 
sleep and sleep 
I fear death so I'd rather run from impending rest but I fear not the reaper, only 
the first death that is 
the death during life that dries out the well of joy and leaves it barren and empty like a drunkards flask 
a voice whispers my minds arena 
echoing across the chambers of my every regret 
Servatis Maleficum 
""Never Sleep, Never Die"" 
Hope is but a lie told by those who have got held it in their tell-tale hearts 
possessions are only coveted by the woken minds to serve as onyx veils to filter out the monotonous pulse of existence
until lady death reaches out 
her bony hands 
darkness cover me again 
the decadence of hedonistic pleasures sought by the proclaimed purveyors of good taste haunt my subconscious 
to some a summers day 
to others a cruel winter 
Oh music, sweet music 
drown out the shameful fire of anger that burns all in which I direct the spear of anguish toward
darkness cover me again

Is this just how adulthood feels like?,"I'm currently 26 years old and live a ""normal life"". But that wasn't always the case. From finishing high school up until my 24th birthday were the worst years of my life. I dropped college, I never left my parents house, played hames all day and cried many nights and felt lonely. I was sad and frustrated. At some point the panic attacks started  and so I finally decided I need to change something. I slowly got my shit together but I kept having  this brain fog and derealization moments most of the time. I never felt like my old self before. It's like those panic attacks and depressive episodes changed me forever. Anyways, that didn't stop me from finally getting a job, hitting the gym, having sex, meeting with friends etc. 

For 2 years until this present moment I kept improving and still am. But I don't feel happy. I suffer from anxiety and Insomnia but I got used to that. I don't get sad anymore. Everything's ""whatever"". I also don't feel like I am the one living my life anymore. I feel like I'm spectating someone else. 

But If I had to guess which of the experiences were Depression I would pick those years where I suffered at my parents house. Now I don't even feel like I have the ability to become that sad anymore. 

Anyways, to come back to the title of my post; I read somewhere that this feeling of emotional numbness is related to becoming an adult, and when your prefrontal cortex fully develops at the age of 25 you become less emotional. So now I'm not sure if I have depression or this ist just me being more mature. Either way... I don't really enjoy life despite having improved so much.",fmticysb,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e17flh/is_this_just_how_adulthood_feels_like/

I'm a mother and I feel like I can't go on anymore,"I feel terrible for feeling this way. I have twin sons that are 2 and they are truly the love of my life which makes this so hard. They were diagnosed with muscular dystrophy a couple months ago and I've been having such a hard time coping with it lately. There's also a possibility they could have kidney disease because of a VUS in their genetic screenings. If you don't know what that is, from my understanding, it means we don't know if they do have kidney disease or if they don't. 

My husband and I wanted to have more children but now are worried about passing on our genetic mutations. It just feels like we have the worst luck and I don't know if I'm strong enough to watch our sons grow up with their disease. I read stories about other children with muscular dystrophy and it terrifies me and if we found out they had kidney disease as well, I don't know if I could go on anymore. I feel selfish for saying this but everyday I am so depressed. I cry multiple times a day and all I do is worry about the future. 

My husband is incredibly supportive and optimistic about the boys' future and we have a very loving family with my mother in law as a nurse.

"In less than a year, I've lost everything.","I dropped out of school at age 16 (eventually completed it online) and since then, my main mission in life was to assist my grandma, she became my sole reason to wake up. I'd go buy things she asked me, took her to the doctor or any appointments she had, cooked for her, and did just about anything she asked me to help her with. That was my life for 10 years. Last November my grandma passed away. My world collapsed, it took me some time to really feel it, but it is very present in my mind now. She was my purpose in life, and with her gone, I feel like I don't know why I'm waking up for anymore.

During all this, I was dating someone (M/M), I had been having some doubts about the relationship that eventually became even louder after an incident in December and after an incident in March, I decided that the relationship had to end. Luckily, I guess, I didn't have to be the one to break it up, as he broke up with me instead a few days after the incident. However it's funny how the brain works, as, despite having decided that I wanted it to end myself, my heart was still broken in the end and my brain had decided that it was all my fault. In my eyes he was my future, the light in the end of the tunnel, but I lost him, and it was all my fault.

The last 4 months after the breakup I've been dealing with sickness, after I caught an ear infection during that time period, presently I am now dealing with some sort of stomach issue, right after I was finally cleared from the ear infection.

All in all, I feel like I lost my purpose in life, I lost the future I dreamt about, and now I seem to be losing my health as well, all whilst my brain beats me up about it every waking moment.

It feels like I've lost everything, I feel empty, smiles and laughs are temporary, just a 2 second break from my constant overwhelming sadness and anxiety. I just want it all to end, I'm too afraid to hurt myself, but every day I wish I wasn't.

never-ending dread,"Hey, I am 18F and I am going to college soon. I have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 11. I have gotten better over the years with the help of therapy and medication. I have more friends, a job, and a promising future, but I just can't let go of the feeling. At the end of the day, whether good or bad, I remember that I will never be truly satisfied with myself or my life. It is painful to remember that this is a lifelong thing and doesn't just go away. I upped my meds recently but it hasn't helped. I don't know what to do anymore. It's hard to do anything when nothing even seems worth it anymore. I don't even know why I'm depressed. I have a good life that is worth living. I'm just not sure if I even want to stick around to see how it will progress. Any help would be appreciated.

"30 years old man, lost and hopeless","Hello there, I don't know what I'm doing with this post, but I guess I just need to vent. I'm a 30 year old man living in an underdeveloped country, struggling with depression and anxiety since high school, which has progressively worsened over the years. I'm currently going through an existential crisis that was triggered in September of last year when I attempted to teach high school students (I lasted just one day). I couldn't handle the stress and anxiety that experience caused me. I walked home crying, felt nauseous, and couldn't sleep that night, so I resigned the following day. Since then, I have been working in my family business, barely functioning, and here I am, living with my parents, too stressed and depressed to apply to jobs with no clear path to follow. I consider myself a highly sensitive person with low tolerance to stress.

I'm in therapy and taking medication, but honestly, it's not working. I've really tried, but I feel like I'm not cut out for this world. Everything makes me stressed and anxious, and I don't feel connected to anyone not my friends or family. I don't enjoy anything these days. I have been diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder, and ADHD-PI, among possibly other conditions. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live this life suffering as I am (I'm crying as I type this). I hope things get better in the future. I feel lost, and sometimes I'm scared that I won't enjoy being alive and experiencing all that life has to offer.

I'm sorry if this post is all over the place, I just needed to vent.

Support For Your Loved Ones,"Just 5 different ways my wife and family support my depression and anxiety. Let me know what you use?

1) Encourage sticking with treatment

My wife sends me cute positive and reinforcing texts the day of my therapy sessions.

2) Listen without judgment or help. Just be there.

I have a couple in my life that I can speak to. It's important to remember that you simply need someone to talk to someone.

3) Give positive reinforcement.

For me this is the biggest help daily. I have a hard time seeing my worth in other people's lives. I need their positive messages to help me see value in myself.

4) Make plans together

Some distractions are needed and welcomed. It helps when I am deeply depressed to have my wife suggest an outing or active we can do together or with the kids. When you do, make sure you're in the moment. Otherewise, it won't help.

5) Patience

For me depression has intensity. It wasn't
until recently that my depression wasn't manageable, and when it was I didn't know I was depressed. But, now that it's here and I look back on years of it I see that it will take me equal or more time to recover from the depression.",Ok_Cold_6763,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e14gla/support_for_your_loved_ones/

I think I’m ready,"The only thing keeping me from it is the idea of someone finding me afterward. I can’t have my last physical act be harming someone else’s psyche. I wish there was a way around it, because I just don’t want to exist anymore.

I’m a nuisance to my friends. I hardly see them anymore., but when I do it’s a forced intimacy. My father is gone and I’m estranged from most of my family because I don’t align with their politics and religion.

My relationship is a mess and I can’t talk to him about any of this. I almost feel like I’m just a body to him. Other than that aspect I think I make him miserable by just existing and he stays with me out of convenience.

Then, today, my 18 year old son lost his temper with me over a stupid subject and basically told me he wanted nothing to do with me until he could deal with me. Things haven’t been great between us for a while, but they weren’t horrible. The things he said today….i think they would have caused even a mentally stabilized parent to contemplate ending things. I’ve never been in this much emotional pain.

There’s one common denominator in all this and it’s me. Who I am. 

Up until a few years ago I really thought I was a pretty decent person. A partner worth having, a fair and patient mom, a good friend, someone who was compassionate, and reasonable.

Look at my life. Why the hell would I stay?

My partner could find a new love.
My friends would get over it.
My son would be relieved.

So the only thing keeping me here is a hypothetical stranger’s emotional well-being.

This has to be either the end of everything or the end of the way I’m living. And I don’t think I have the strength to start all over.

Nothing new under the sun.,"Hey. 

I'm really anxious about this post. Part of me find it ridiculous to even try and talk about on it on the internet, where mind you, I didn't always receive good advice. But every other part of me is screaming for help and so far I didn't had a better idea. 

I've been struggling with depression a lot. Since early in my teenage years. Nothing too troublesome or severe. Never really tough about harming myself, never really tough about harming others also. Just feeling plain bad without really having a why. Growing up, I understood that's how most people feel. Some just know how to hide it better than others. 
I've always felt a disconnect with other human beings, even family, when my father got sick, our relationship was really bad and had close to no remorse not seeing him at first and hugely regretted it afterwards. When he died was probably the first time I become a wreck. No showers for weeks, no shaving, just outright going back to primitive form. Stopped going to college and stopped my laws studies. It's also around  the time I stopped being a regular consumer of marijuana and became plain right addicted to it. 
I struggled a lot, got into some creative activites, met a lot of people including what will became afterwards my SO. We had a 3y ride, with ups and downs, first time I ever got into something serious and ended sharing with her a lot about my insecurities and fears. The relationship ended badly. Looking backwards it wasn't really anyone fault, it's just that we weren't meant for each other. But that girl really ripped my heart appart, and taught me a lesson about sharing your feelings with someone. 
I took maybe a year and half to re-build myself, start going to gym and felt better than ever. I finished my law degree and a woman from my past made a reappearance in my life ( not the former SO ). This girl really illuminated my life and gave me a purpose. I really touched the sky and for the first time as far as I could remember I suprised myself thinking about a better future. 
We lasted about 6 months. 6 magical months where I felt LOVED and cared for. Something I didn't even realized had been missing in my life. But life has its own ironical part, and although it didn't end badly, it ended in a way where it convinced me that I cannot Bond with anybody else as I can't understand them. I don't know what's the meaning of loving someone. I don't know how to properly communicate. Heck I don't even know if I want that ? I don't even know of one functioning family, so would I ever bother make one ? To fail at it miserably like everyone I know ? 
Why do fucking anything ( reading Camus probably didn't help tho he made a point, it's either fight the absurd or suicide ) ? 

I'm lost. I don't want to fight anymore, I don't see no reason to fight. Im not in touch with any relatives, my mother is sick and dying at an increasing rate, my brother and I will no longer talk when she is out of the picture. I still have friends, but they living they're own battle, helping me find a purpose is not really their job, and frankly I don't hold them in esteem high enough to take their advices. 
I don't take any pleasure in any activity, probably because I fucked the chemistry if my brain few years ago. 
I am litteraly actively looking for an easy exit. I go ride with the drunk drivers I know, take uncessary risks I would have never taken before, and worst, I feel no thrill. 

Talking to a professional is out of the question outright as it's highly disregarded in my culture and I would most likely end up in a mental illness facility drugged to the bone if somebody in my family even suspected I was feeling this way. 
I don't really look for any advices, or anything. I just wanted to describe the void I'm feeling right now. And I feel stupid doing it.",Lee77wak,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e0yps9/nothing_new_under_the_sun/

How can I accomidate myself when I am in a depressive episode but have to go out? ,"Depression takes a whole lot out of me both physically and mentally, I suppose that is expected. I'm currently stuck in quite a long depressive episode and today I went out with a friend to town. Whilst it was ok during the moment, when I got home and right now in the night as I'm writing this, I can really notice the toll it has taken on me. I am doing worse mentally tonight than I have been other nights and physically I was in pain when I got home and now I'm just exhausted.

However, tomorrow I'm going to the beach with some different friends and then Saturday my band is playing some songs at a party meaning I'll be out from mid afternoon until midnight (most likely) and the night is when things effect me the worst. The majority of my friends (the other band members) are going home immediately after we perform our songs whereas I have to stay until the very end if I want a lift back. I can tell tomorrow is going to be a bad day mentally which will most likely carry over to Saturday as well. 

I get to see my friend on Saturday who is aware of the struggles I've been goung through recently so that might ease things a bit, having her there but she has to leave early so I might be on my own for a long ish while after that. 

Does anyone know how I can make tomorrow and Saturday better? I don't want to go back to isolating myself but at the same time, going out and meeting people is worsening everything I already feel but I still want to see my friends, I just know I won't feel amazing when doing so and I'll feel even worse during the aftermath.",_Citrus_Friend,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e13owr/how_can_i_accomidate_myself_when_i_am_in_a/
Finding friends that're also in the same boat helps.,"A common saying with depression is that ""nobody understands me."" 

I wanna validate that. 

Me feeling like my friends genuinely don't understand my struggles widens the hole in my heart that was already decaying. 

There ARE people out there who're also going through it, and there are people that genuinely understand.

A very powerful lesson i've had to learn is that your friends are not your therapists. They aren't going to always know what to say, how to say it, or how to support you. Its up to you at that point how you feel you need to proceed with those friends. You can try to tell them how to support you, or tell them you need space for the time being. 

You need support, you need community, and you need to find people who get you. 

This message isn't just for you, but also for me, as i've never felt more alone. And i'm living with those friends that don't understand.

Surviving is horrible.,"I’ve tried overdosing more times than I can count and I’m here to say that it isn’t worth it. Even if you were to attempt any other method there is still that chance of survival, dying is awful. I remember when I nearly succeeded and I could feel my body shutting down, it wasn’t pleasant and when I did survive I was sick for weeks constantly vomitting everywhere. I don’t try to attempt suicide anymore even though I am severely depressed, what I’ve used to cope is taking a few Benadryls at night to get me relaxed(about 8 or 12). It is better than trying to overdose, if anyone is thinking about attempting to overdose DO NOT! Find other solutions to keep your mind away from suicidal ideation, I know it is really hard to, but surviving is worse than death could ever bring and that fear is what is keeping me from ending it. In the meantime, list some (positive) important things in your life that you went through recently starting from your last attempt, you would have missed those if you had succeeded that day.

I know that in the future I might attempt again because of how severe my depression is but it is the thought that counts and recovery is a long process, stay strong fellas and I hope I gave you a reason to stay a little longer.💪",Naktve,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e0lxj5/surviving_is_horrible/

i’ve also found out that my suspicions about people not wanting me around at events was right because my friends have been talking about me being a burden in public behind my back. they think i’m the most boring person on the planet and i can absolutely tell. i guess it also confirms that people have me around because they pity me, which sucks

like i said i’m supposed to go to grad school later this year but i’m just not sure i can do it. sad doesn’t even fucking cut it anymore i’m just miserable all the time and everything is all my fault always and i try to fix myself so proactively and not wallow in self pity but nothing ever gets better

i’m so tired of living i’m so tired of being a burden i’m so tired of never being what anyone wants

i so desperately wish i were someone who people were excited to see. i so desperately wish the love i have for my friends was reciprocated. i so desperately wish i were someone people wanted in their lives forever and even complaining like this seems so gross and narcissistic that i don’t even feel like i should

i’ve stopped writing the poetry i’ve tried to make a regular habit because it all feels empty, i don’t feel inspired by anything anymore, everything feels dull, and any musings i can muster feel forced

everything hurts that much more because i don’t want to be sad and i’m trying so hard to get better and to be better i’m so tired of being sad i just want to be happy and happiness evades me time and time again",caucasian_scammer,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e0xaq3/being_alone/

Panic Attack,"I have been suffering with anxiety and depression on and off for 10 years. Since last year, my anxiety keeps peaking often. I had a terrible panic attack this morning - breathlessness, weakness in knees, shivering, difficulty in talking. I had to immediately go to ER. Luckily, the vitals were fine.

But I really need to break this cycle. I keep falling in the loop of anxiety. I have realised lately that a lot of it is triggered by work. I think my capacity to take work stress has gone down significantly and often my panic / stress peaks closer to my login time. I don't want to give up on this job. But I feel helpless often.

Anyone who is going through something similar. How did you deal with such panic?",Brilliant_Shoe1787,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e0wv2x/panic_attack/
Sold my most beloved things due to addiction 2 years ago ,"Sold my prized and rare comic book/toy collection and expensive Swiss watch. I worked hard for years to get these things and the comics have exploded in price since bought them. So getting them back seems impossible. Covid happened, lost my job, and then I developed a cocaine addiction (which I sold my stuff for) that lasted two months before I was broke and had nothing again. I had to move back in with a parent in a small town that has no jobs and literally nothing.  Now I’m on disability making next to nothing in Ontario, Canada and literally can’t afford to do anything but pay rent and groceries every month and just barely at that. I have so much hatred directed at myself for selling these things and hatred at the comic shop I used to love for ripping me off. One item they offered me 20$ for and sold it in their store for 1000$. I honestly fantasize about suicide but know I’ll never do it, because I live out of spite. The economy seems hopeless in Canada and all the hobbies I had I can no longer afford for the time being.

Do I have psychotic depression?,"Yesterday my therapist told me that I likely have a combination OCD and episodes of major depression with psychotic elements. 

I couldn’t tell if it was part of the OCD or normal depression, but I’ve had these weird episodes my entire life that I couldn’t ever quite explain. Someone will say something to do something, and I’ll spiral about it until it becomes the only thing I can think. I go nonverbal, and I loose touch with reality. I have trouble moving, and I can’t speak. I get major intrusive thoughts about things that people said or things I’ve done, and whenever people try to talk to me to pull me out of it I get more intrusive thoughts and it worsens. I get intrusive thoughts that I’m a burden, that no one loves me, and I should’ve killed myself when I was 14. I want reassurance, but even the act of wanting reassurance makes me spiral more since it convinces me I’m doing it for attention. It’s like there’s 1,000 thoughts happening in my brain all at once, and I’m not able to keep up with them or even consciously think all of them. Sometimes the only thing I can say or think is “it hurts make it stop” on repeat.

These episodes will last anywhere from hours to days. I always feel shaky coming out of them. What do I call this feeling? Could it be depression with some element of psychosis?",Weeping_willow_trees,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e11cyp/do_i_have_psychotic_depression/

How do I not ruin my relationship with my depression?,"I love my boyfriend but our relationship makes me miserable.

Before meeting him I had nobody I could even talk to casually- now I can talk to him about my feelings and absolutely anything, which is amazing and I am very grateful for him. But we are very different, and because of being around him all this time, I feel like all of my insecurities are constantly in my face. I still have 0 friends- people are friendly with me, but it's not like anybody would want to casually grab a coffe with me. Him on the other hand- he has so many good relationships in his life, it's crazy to me. I didn't think it was even possible. He has close friends he can have fun and cry with, has good relationship with his siblings and anybody that meets him wants to talk to him. He is extremely friendly and charismatic and can adapt to people easily. He's attractive and confident- and I'm constantly embarassed of everything that I do. I don't even post on social media because I feel like either nobody cares or they will make fun of how pathetic and unskilled I am. It's like he's living in creative mode, while I'm constantly overthinking every move. But I have nobody else. I try to reach out to people but it never works. And I'm not a people magnet like he is. I found myself being upset and jealous of his female friends often and feel insecure as I know that if we broke up he would go back to his tens of friends with benefits or any girl that is interested in him, and I would be all by myself. His friends like me but they are still his friends, and they like me exactly and only because of that.

I am in a relationship but I feel lonely all the time. And I don't want him to know that I am this insecure and jealous and pathetic. I already constantly wonder why he is even with me. I thought that being with someone like him would help with my self esteem but I feel the opposite. I feel unlikeable, boring and unattractive. I don't even feel like a person. I feel like I'm just there to observe him most of the time. I was depressed and lonely before, but it at least made sense then as I was kind of a shut in and it felt like there was nothing outside my room filled with my negative thoughts. Now I'm constantly slapped in the face with the reality of most people- with their own problems and all, but able to connect with each other and actually be alive. But I'm still just an observer, even in my own relationship and life and I can't help but cry every free evening that I have.

I hate how I feel now, but I don't want to go back to how it was in the years before. Maybe I will never feel fine, but I don't know how to control my feelings anymore. I've been on every possible antidepressant, on anti-anxiety medication, neuroleptics, mood stabilizers and ADHD medication and nothing helped. I can't afford therapy. I hate feeling like this but I am extremely scared of him leaving me, because I had nothing good in my life before he was in it and was s\*\*\*idal. I know it's not healthy but it seems like there is no way out of this + he might be the only person that actually cares about me. I am 28 and I've never had someone that would be so genuinely interested in how I feel about anything. Outside of that he's just a really kind, curious, genuine person and we have similar views, sense of humor and interests. I just don't know how to cope with all these negative feelings all the time and not sabotaging the relationship by being down and crying every time we see each other or being secretive and dishonest. I don't want him to know how insecure I am, this is not who he was attracted to and it's not ok for me to make him my therapist now. I already stopped speaking with him for a few days once because I was crying all day every day, and even though I told him I need a break because I'm stressed with whatever, he told me that he needs me to communicate and it made him very worried. I was so jealous and irritated by him not seeing how he's hurting me but at the same time felt so bad for him. In all of this, I think I hate myself the most.

TLDR: My relationship somehow lowered my self esteem even more and I am having conflicting feelings about the only person in the world that wants to see me. I feel like I can't trust my emotions and feel like I'm going insane.",skippidy-flippidy,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e119wx/how_do_i_not_ruin_my_relationship_with_my/

"Im losing everything and i can't stand up for myself, how do you find strenght to do so?","(if you think there's better sub to ask it please suggest me which one thank you)

I just want to ask just this:

When you have nobody on your side and everyone against you keep pushing you to the side, how do you fight for yourself? 

I ask this because i've learned about myself that once i lost my family and live completly by myself, it's like i lost a will to live too and with every problem coming up i imedietly feel defeated and powerless, like i can't defend myself anymore about anything. It feels like i dont have any self worth to do anything for myself anymore.

 (I dont have any closer friends, i have only a boyfriend but i don't feel it's supportive relationship and even with him i feel with time i'm losing myself by allowing him for mental or physical abuse, in general for things i've never thought i would allow)

My boyfriend once said it looks like i was never taught to stand up for myself, and yeah i never learned that. But throughout life i had so many moments when i stood up for my siblings, for my mom, for a friend and i handled some very hard situations and thought it made me a strong person, but now i look back the only reason i felt strong enough to deal with anything was always the feeling i do it for someone.

So this year i lost everyone of the last close people to me. And from this moment any problem i experience i feel just hopeless and like there's no solutions for me, i started to feel completly powerless in relationship and even afraid of my boyfriend.

And now i have situation where i can lose everything i own, also my only place to live if i don't stand up and fight for myself - and even in this situation i just feel so small and like i have no power to do anything, i feel outnumbered, overpowered and like i'm a nobody.

So i'm serious about this question, because it feels like i'm a lost cause by now - how can i find strenght and feel worthy enough to fight for myself?

scared to tell anyone else about my depression ,"So I’ve been depressed on and off for a few years now but things have really taken a turn for the worse when I got diagnosed with a physical health issue about a year ago. I told my friend about my passive SI and depression/anxiety a while back. Since then I’ve gotten a therapist, psychiatrist, and medication for it but it’s still pretty bad.

I depended on her too much this past year, being anxious that I was being too much on her and that I wasn’t getting better fast enough. There was a point where all I could talk about was how bad I felt and that was the only topic of conversation. At the same time she would often cancel a lot of our plans and I felt guilty for being such a strain on her. She began to resent me and I completely get it. Our relationship has gotten better but I’m terrified to talk about my mental health with her at all. I feel like it’s such a waste of time and I feel immense guilt every time I go to her. I’m even anxious at the thought of seeing her again.

I want to have friends that care about me but I’m scared of hurting them with my depression. Do I just stop telling people? I’m tired of being such a burden on others and I don’t know what to do but I’m scared of losing everyone.

How do you manage the loss of appetite?,"Barely anything seems appetizing anymore. I force myself to have the food I am offered by my family but I dislike eating in general right now.

I can’t do this anymore. ,"My name is Cory, I am 29M, I’ve always suffered from anxiety and depression to an extent. But I thought I had it. I was in a good marriage with 2 beautiful children. Until everything went to hell. I lost my job as a software developer and have had every other door close in my face since. My wife of 8 years told me she didn’t really love me and wanted a more exciting life and so she asked for a divorce. She told me my 2 yo son isn’t even my son. So now I live in a trailer with my 6 yo daughter, I can’t find a job to save my life and I just try every day to keep a smile on my face for her. But I’m tired. Tired of trying, tired of failing. I’m a failure of a husband, a failure as a father and a failure as a man. I’m worthless. The only reason I haven’t ended it yet is that I don’t want my daughter to think her dad committed suicide. I try to teach her to love herself and be proud of herself and I can’t even do that. I find myself daydreaming of getting in an accident or someone walking in to where I’m at with a gun. I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I don’t want to be this way anymore. But I don’t see another way out. My heart is broken and it is gone forever.

M27 first time posting here.,"Finally gathered the courage to speak about this on an open platform. This incident has been eating me up for the better of a year now, I've tried everything yet can't move on from it. I feel there's no hope and I've lost all trust from love and relationship.

Okay so like I don't even know where to begin.  Four years, man, four years we were together.  Trying for a baby, finally got the positive test, we were over the moon. Then this work trip comes up, which required me to be abroad for two weeks.  Finished everything early, figured I'd surprise her, you know, how much these girls loves surprises.  Booked the next flight back, picturing her face lighting up. Walked into the apartment, dark hallway, bedroom light flickering. Called out her name, all excited, and that's when I heard it. Sounds, laughter, stuff you don't ever want to hear.  Opened the door and well, let's just say our future together went up in flames right there. And the worse part of it all is that the baby wasn't even mine. Couldn't get a straight answer out of her either.  Who knows how long it'd been going on behind my back. Walked away from her and the relationship and a baby that could've been mine, the whole thing.  Just sitting here now, feels like someone ripped the rug out from under me. It's been quite some time since this happened.

Just a broken guy looking for some direction in life.

I’m 25. I live on my own. For a while, I thought I felt happy. It was false happiness. I could see right through it. I knew deep down that I had nothing to be happy about. I knew that no matter what I told myself, I’d still be a shitty person. Fat. Ugly. It’s finally coming to an end though. I’m slowly snapping back into the reality of my situation. Slowly realizing that I’ll finally be out of this endless loop of suffering. At least I hope. The times I’ve tried in the past, it really seemed impossible. I just want nothing more than to be unrestrained by time. 

Today, I realized some of my close friends think I’m a creep. I don’t understand what I did to make them feel that way. I’m asexual and I do my best to protect those close to me. I don’t get it.

Especially when traumatic things in life happen .. because as it is it’s hard to get up on the daily even when nothing is going on. It’s an everyday battle and it’s like we are expected to try and combat this with therapy and medicine and not many understand the severity of mental illness. Those things can help but it’s not a fix.  It’s like no matter what we can’t be happy or know how to turn that switch on and off. people don’t know what it’s like to be that down bad.

Ambitionless person,"Hello fellow depressed sadistic people. I am 24 male. A hopeless person, who lost the will power and no intention of improving. I still live with my parents. But it's much common in India. So no taboo. Still people see me with ill eyes like some one has casted black magic on me.

So let's get to the main topic.
About my family my dad owns an coal exporting business. They have like 4-5 tippers. Each tipper has 1 driver 1 cleaner. Most of the things are automated, so my dad only checks up weekly reports and clearing the payment from parties. My dad has did so much hardships, throughout his life to setup all this from zero.

Reading till you think like I got good life, but no you are wrong I don't have interest in any of this. My dad always think of me like working somewhere abroad in a big MNC. But I don't have any ambitions like that in me.

I don't know how to handle all this by myself like my father. I haven't seen how they manage people. I actually don't know will I able to get anything, or just everything collapsed when I take anything in my hand. I don't know negotiations and don't know how to talk with people in rough manner. I am fked up.

I don't know whether I work in my core field or help my father out which I am afraid of. But as their only son(I have a sister) it's my duty to help them out. I can't make much money in job. And the work time is also less like my father do around 2-3 hrs a day. Idk man I just don't know.

Pros :-
1. I am 6 ft, 100kg+ guy with strong body type.
2. About my education I have BTECH CSE degree. I have worked around 6 month in my core field. (Currently resigned)
3. I don't smoke, drink or weed. (Not a single bad habit, watch porn sometimes if you consider it as)

Cons :-
1. I generally grown up alone, no siblings till I was 7.
2. I don't have any friends, spent my college days alone in hostel room. (Doing nothing)
3. Since COVID I gained about 20-30 kg due to my turtle like lifestyle. (I was about 75-80kg that time)
4. I Woke up around 9-10am everyday(since COVID).
5. I have never work out. Not even a single day in my life. 
6. I don't know what I want from my life.
7. I don't have much self esteem as me, other than my father's name. (Without th3m I am nothing)

They  showed me a policy some days before, which states that when I become 30 years old, I will receive 50 laks INR. I literally ran and cried in my room. I definitely think my father deserved a better son, who would have made him proud for the efforts they took. They are the best father but I am the worst son who did nothing but embarassed them everytime. Unlike me who feel like a loser, who got everything sorted but still don't want to admit it.

A poem I wrote,"But they don't understand it
They don't know that I'm in pain
And all my efforts to be better
I feel they are in vain

Waking up feeling nothing
And going to bed the same
So throughout all of this
How am I supposed to be sain 

I am strong for all of you
But I don't care about me
No because if I look at myself
I hate what I see

And what you don't get
Is when I look in the mirror 
All I see is someone 
Nothing more than inferior 

So why should I care
What happens to me 
If I'll never know 
That feeling of glee

I sit in my mind
Broken and sad
And I don't know why
I guess that's what makes me mad

I don't know why
My mind is like this
And it can't be fixed
By that true loves kiss

So I sit here 
Feeling unheard 
And you know what 
That's why I hurt

I put on a front for everyone ,"When someone meets me or even when my friends hang out with me while we play games together, I put on a front that I am this happy guy, but deep down I'm suffering so badly.


When I was with my last girlfriend, I bought a ring for her, but one morning I got a text from her saying, ""I just can't do this anymore..."" Of course since I was in love with her and she was my world, I tried so hard to get ahold of her, but with no luck. On top of all of that, my Grandmother(RIP) was put in the hospital where she would die a couple of weeks later.


Ever since then I have been so freaking broken on the inside. When I needed my girl the most, she dumped me like I was trash. I guess I am trash since she wasn't the only girl to do this to me. I'm 32 and I have nothing to show for it... No house, no kids, no wife... I guess I need to just get used to the fact that I am just going to be alone my whole life. Video games can't even hold my interest anymore hardly. 

Sometimes I am so close to just getting into my Truck and just run into a wall or something like that to just end this pain I feel every second of everyday, but then I just can not get myself to do it. I do not know what stops me, but something does if that makes sense.

Dont have the energy to cook anything and pretty much let myself live off of one or 2 string cheeses and what not- little to nothing, well i went from 167lbs to as of rn 155lbs in a few weeks and i cant help but feel like its not enough, my head is begging for them to cook food i cant stomach, to go out more- i hate my body and this is the fastest ive dropped ever.. But i dont think i want to have this?

I dont want to develop a Ed- dont want to be put at risk of doctors asking questions, im almost 20 and yet here i am feeling like a child- how do i stop this before its all my head craves? Seeing the numbers drop is just- good? Feels good.. But- fuck man- even that is causing my depression to skyrocket cause it turned into a ""not enough"" situation i cant bring myself to ask anyone around me so i might as well ask the area where depression is well known

How do i stop the depression -&gt; ed spiral??

What do I do ? ,"I'm just 18. From a middle class family. I just completed my school and scored average. On the result day my mom was ok but my father was disappointed as always, he knows well that I'm an average student but he always expects more. When I was in school I 100% decided to END my life because there was nothing for me to do. I doesn't score good,my father abuses me (physically and mentally),I'm not good looking, I have no social skills, I can't talk properly (I stutter), didn't had many friends. But after completing school and there was a RELIEF which didn't last long.

If I tell you that being this way wasn't my fault it was my father's then I'm not wrong. My father is strange. I don't seem to understand him fully. In 18 years of my life my father always wanted me to sit in the house and study as if I was preparing to go in war. He always restricted me to hang out with friends. Whenever he sees me standing outside he shouts ""COME INSIDE"".

I despise EVERYONE who have a nice and friendly Family. I never got to make any girlfriend not even a female friend, I just can't talk properly and who would want a friend like that, my personality is just a joke (I have no personality). My every friend has a supportive family they can go anywhere they want but I can't, to join them I would just lie knowing even in the 1000 years they would never let me go. 

I'm fuckin 18 years old and they would still treat me like an 8 y/o. I don't understand why they do this because if they were SUPPORTIVE they would've motivated or understood me even a bit but they don't. I've lost my count asking them for gym so that I can join my friends but the only point in their defence to stop me is that they say ""they're all idiots they've got nothing to do what if heartattack strikes them or they're just spoiled"". 

I will rot in my room for the rest of my life or I will hang myself to fan(most peaceful option though).",imyourkook,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1e0uq3g/what_do_i_do/

I can’t get out of bed even when I want to ,"I don’t sleep all night, by the time morning comes I tell myself that I should close my eyes for a bit and that makes me sleep through the day. Even when I know I have things to do I can’t seem to get out of bed, I keep seeing dreams of situations I run away from my life. People I don’t wanna face and everything that is wrong in my life. I get these paralysing thoughts and I can’t seem to move even a little. My legs seems like they are weak, I have no reason to want to get up.
I don’t want to get meds I want to heal by myself but it’s so hard. 
I just moved 10 days ago to a new apartment and there are boxes everywhere I haven’t even been able to unpack, or shower. My best friend leaves in a few days and I wanna spend time with her but I can’t seem to move. 
My life is in shambles, no prospects or anything. I left my university and I’m supposed to “try” to apply for studying abroad but my parents keep telling me we don’t have any money for my education and I keep loosing the battle to my anxiety and I can’t even get myself to try. I blame myself because I can’t make up my mind to choose a path, I’m 23 and my parents are really old. The thought of leaving scares me but I’m stuck in this loop, I wish I knew what to do.

I went skydiving and felt nothing...,"Last week I did something that I thought would cheer me up. Something that SHOULD have made me feel something. This is not the first time I've I jumped from a plane. I'm a licensed skydiver and it was my 51st jump. It was however, my 1st time jumping in another country. Before the flight I had a little bit of anxiety. However for the entire plane ride, opening the door and even diving out of the plane; I was numb. Freefalling at over 200km/h for 40 seconds, I was dumbfounded how I could be so immune to this. I pulled my parachute, landed and acted like it was awesome when people asked so I didn't come off as a psychopath. I'm not crazy. I'm just depressed. 

I'm the kind of person who can't sit still for too long. I'm 26 and I've moved about 12 times and had over 14 jobs. My current job is packing parachutes for a skydiving company. 

I try to fill the void with adrenaline and new experiences but as soon as I get bored I move on because I know that I'll get extremely miserable if I stay put. 

This is a reccuring problem in my life showing itself again. I know I'm not the only person with depression who copes this way. It's not great but I've been able to keep my head above water because of it. I haven't returned to my servere suicidal teen days but I'm not fulfilled in life by living a nomadic lifestyle. I find it almost impossible to attain significant relationships. It's exceptionally difficult to grow when I keep handicapping myself by changing the game or environment. But i'm never satisfied and never content. So... I move.

"I feel horribly spineless, and somewhat lost ","I struggle horribly with others opinions of me, and have grown to hate myself due to their opinions of me. I feel often misunderstood, and not able to convey what I’m actually trying to say, this causes many of the situations i find myself in.  However, there are times where I just shove down my feelings and don’t actually confront them. I struggle to even tell my therapist these things, because I worry she may think less of me. (Yes I know this is inherently contradictory to the entire idea of therapy, but even still I struggle with it.) 
Many people agree that I’m not some horrible person, even when I tell them everything I struggle with, but i still deal  with feelings of extreme inadequacy and very much with what if’s about things that happen  (what if x happens because of y). All my friends also say I should drop the toxic people in my life, but I struggle because I worry of what they could say about me to other people. 

I know many of you will just believe this is self-sabotage on my part, and i feel that to a very heavy degree, because every time I have anyone swing any praises my way I believe none of it is warranted, and I believe that I don’t deserve any of it. I am on a pretty low-strength antidepressant, and it has helped me immensely, though i’m pretty  sure my body has just gotten used to the medication itself. 

I also am one to ruminate deeply and despair about my past, I haven’t done anything greatly heinous or anything like that, however I am scared some of the stupid and or embarrassing   situations I have been in will come back to bite me. Every single day I wake up almost numb to the things around me, and if something does flare up it is usually fear about perceived issues or mistakes I’ve made in the past. Being completely transparent, I have made people uncomfortable unintentionally  and have struggled with boundaries and oversharing in the past, but many of the people in my life have said they have seen my growth and change, though in my own eyes I can’t see it because I seem to climb out of one emotional hole, just to find myself back at the bottom of another months later. 

Finally, i have a mild leg disability (Triplegic Cerebral Palsy) that while not greatly altering my appearance, it seems to greatly affect me emotionally and mentally, in the fact that it causes much of my self-esteem issues, and I believe up until recently had made me struggle with interactions because I would make up my mind about how people would perceive me just solely based upon how I assumed they would react which wasn’t fair to them at all.

I wear countless masks throughout the day and hope the illusion will break so I can be the authentic self. A meager reminder that I am not human but a shell of what was. The only thing left behind in that box is sadness that has formed into nihility and disappointment of what existence is meant to be. I want to see color for what it is, not just the hope to see color again. I worry that I never knew what color was, because I can’t seem to remember what it’s like to be more than a mere hole in what should have been. Perhaps a masked man’s destiny is to be the antithesis in color. But their eyes weep for color.

"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail.

*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.  

Please [let us know discreetly](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) if you see anyone exhibiting these or similar behaviours. We don't recommend trying to engage with them directly.",SQLwitch,248,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/cz6nfd/new_wiki_on_how_to_avoid_accidentally_encouraging/
Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is ever allowed here. No matter what day it is.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide is, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times. 

Please understand that we're all for smart, strategic mental-health and suicide-prevention activism. It's essential to fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and to fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding. Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL. 

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population. We used to allow it but the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming.  We do regret the need for this rule, but the need is inescapable. 

Our population is all too well aware of the issues and causes that need support and largely not in a position to take action, so besides the fact that activism is often salt in our community's wounds, it's a waste of the activists' time.

**tl;dr** Any fundraising, awareness raising, petitions, calls for participation, or any post that's about any cause or issue (rather than a request for personal support) is not allowed here.

Suicidal thoughts comforting in everyday life,"I was scrolling through this sub a few months ago and tried to take my life and failed. I was unemployed for a year, barely no friends, just broke up with my partner, absolutely nothing going for me. I have never felt this low. I was one of those people that couldn’t understand people actually going through with it until I did. 

I woke up one day and started looking for jobs and would tell myself “if I don’t find one I can just kill myself” then I went to a mental health professional to get meds for suicidal thoughts, I told myself “if these meds don’t work I’ll kill myself” they worked to subside my suicidal thoughts about 75%. I got a job offer and told myself “if I hate this job I’ll kill myself.” I didn’t hate the job, don’t love it tho

Does anyone else do the same to keep going? Thinking of suicide is comforting for me that there is a way out but it had made it easier to move forward and deal with stress with it in the back of my mind everyday.

i don’t understand how normal people think,"i wanna preface this by saying i am in no way saying that people don’t deserve to live, not at all, and i don’t want anyone to misinterpret my words as that. i’m just thinking i don’t understand how normal people have the inherent feeling that they deserve to be alive, because i don’t. like even when they fuck up, they never feel the urge to hurt themselves or kill themselves. i just don’t understand. how do people constantly have the innate feeling that they deserve to be alive? i just don’t get it. 

i don’t think i’m going to kill myself because of my fear of the afterlife (or lack there of) but i fantasise about it constantly. i think about how i would do it. i plan it. i type out goodbye messages i never send. i want to do it so bad but i’m scared. and i don’t understand how people can not have that feeling, because i’ve had it for as long as i can remember. even since i was a little

I (35M) think I have decided I will end my life (fake names),"I talked to a friend (35F) a few days ago, Leya. We were talking about her friend Angie (36F). Jessie does not have herself together. Has CC debt of 5k, due to having fun. Her career isn't that great either, she barely has enough to pay off the CC debt. Leya, is accomplished (well deserved) has a strong social group. She shared that if she were in Jessies shoes, she'd off herself.

The thing is I, am not well off. I have a CC debt of 15k. 12k due to schooling. The rest due to actual needs. I lost my job in April. I haven't been able to find a job since then. I have hardly anymore savings since I moved to a state for family since my mom died.

in late 2011, I was pursing a different career pathway. but my brother POS who I was living with at the time in Boston, threatened to kick me out if I continued to pursue that career path. I wish I just told to piss off then. I have chosen to take such terrible advise from someone I mistakenly looked up to. I realize he did not look to my best interest.

Too little to late, I am no longer associate with my family due to the mistreatment. Additionally my brother said he relates to our father 2 weeks prior to sharing how our dad used to beat our mom, so that was a factor in making me realize how inhuman POS is.

But I am not great either, I have lost many friends, I have tried therapy for the past 6-8 years. It helped, but every time I lost a friend, or had to end one... I try to date, but I don't put any effort in. I have a hard time flirting because I know I wouldn't be a great partner. I would make her miserable. I just feel terrible. I feel let down. I feel hopeless. I feel unworthy. I feel unwanted. I know it is my fault. I could've had a spine and stuck up for myself more. I could've chose not to move. I could've called out the terrible treatment of mom.

I have currently have nothing. I have my moms jewelery, and there is no way I am giving it to my family. I will give it to the few friends who really cared for me though.

I haven't been happy for the past 13 years really. I haven't been me either. And these past 5 years have been pure misery. I don't think Leya intended for me to take what she said to heart. But honestly, I just give up. I have given up for the past few years and only yesterday did I realize it. I want it all to end. I am a coward in so many ways. I just don't understand how others did it. But I don't want to live in misery. I might be able to avoid being homeless. But I will still be miserable. I will still have no job. I want to feel peace or nothingness.

Edit: I have a friend who wants to help me move back. I'd also be sharing an apartment with someone. But the fact I am getting help makes me feel disgusted with myself. I can't live myself already. And I already feel misery. I don't want to be a leech or a parasite. ",Eyewanthappiness,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e466y0/i_35m_think_i_have_decided_i_will_end_my_life/

Weight problems,"I have some kind of eating disorder. I'm stuck in a binge restric cycle and I can't stop fucking eating.

I can’t stop thinking about it,"I (23F-ish) can’t stop thinking about killing myself. I tend to end up imagining how or when I’ll kill myself, and I keep imagining what or if I say anything to bother people before I do it. I have a handful of friends who I feel as though I have trapped in a bugs bunny-esque social contraption to stay out of obligation and I know my family despises me and how I rarely leave my room. Often, I crutch these ideas as though I’m telling my “imaginary therapist” but lately that barrier has been withering away and it feels more solid. I refuse to tell people because of how they have reacted to less intense things I or other figures have said in the past.

I’ve been thinking that I’m evil, unloveable, and repulsive. I know what my body looks like and I get the whole “you’re just not your type” but at the end of the day I hate how I am regardless of the state because I’m the one inside it. I’ve never been desired and the idea that I could be is laughable and eldritch. I feel as though the only worth I have is through my job, but that the cost of me existing outweighs it, significantly. I feel evil for existing and not having died sooner.

For a while I thought I was fine, I was able to beat this shit back into the bay for a few years with it cropping up occasionally but I feel like I’ve fallen into “bad habits”. I want to lie down on the train tracks and get run over.

I hate this shit so much because I know that sometimes I feel better, less or even not suicidal. But the issue is that I really feel like a completely different person, and being that way I know logically that I have the same thoughts but they just don’t “feel” the same like I’m flipping between two side of a coin. When I feel like shit, the “good thoughts” just feel like bs i tell myself, and when I feel fine the “bad thoughts” just register as melodramatic nonsense.

I just wrote a suicide note,"I was thinking about suicide for almost 4 years. And I have never even felt like to write or think about writing one.

But today (tonight) I did. I just felt like it would be good for explaining, not only for those I leave here, but also for me.

I wrote it as a (draft) so I might will write the real one when the time comes...

I'm getting more desperate day by day. I think I'm getting better but no, it's getting much worse. My (deep) downs are getting deeper, and more frequent.

I got too much love as a child. It’s ruined me.,"I’ve come to the conclusion lately that I do not want to live and function as an adult. I shouldn’t have to have any commitments or responsibilities. I should have died age 7. My life has been downhill since then. 

My parents loved - and still love - me so hard, it makes me hurt inside. I don’t know if that makes sense? I refuse to look for romantic love because the only people I want to care about are them. The more years I spend masking my true self (because nobody - nobody - would ever suspect I’m like this; me, the attractive, successful career woman who has bought her own apartment and been living independently for over ten years), the more I want to give it all up and just move back in with them and totally regress. I want to regress to the age I was when I didn’t know of negative emotions, or anxiety, of grief and loss. I want to be ignorant. I am both saddened and filled with rage that growing up happened. I want it to be just the three of us forever. To play with Barbies with my dad in the garden. I want to see colours as brightly as I used to. I want my mum to hold me tight. The love I experienced in my childhood is like a chokehold. On a bad day, old memories is all I can think about. I cycle through them in my brain and cry until I have no voice left.

Nobody asked me if I wanted to be an adult. Nobody checked with me. I watch my friends get married and have kids and I’m like why. Why do you want to adult so badly? How sad that you are now taking care of your own children. You should still be children yourselves. Why the fuck are we getting older?

And then, because everyone seems to be going down that path, I start thinking ‘What gene am I missing that I turned out so wrong?’

I would like to die a dignified death with my parents in a couple of decades’ time. I can hold on till then if I know I get to go with them. I fully intend to end my life as soon as they go, but I am hoping that they might be interested in looking into options of going the three of us at the same time.

Seems like my end is near ,"The last couple years have been really difficult. I have lost a lot. A couple of the main things are my mom and my home. I am currently in a homeless shelter for the last year and now they are pushing me out the door. The other week when they gave me a date, July 26th, I flipped out. 

I have a job but not enough income to afford to pay for an apartment. I have had epilepsy my entire life so it's has been difficult keeping a job and getting along with people. I made a decision about 20 years ago that if my mom passed away first and I ended up on the streets I wouldn't go on living. I mean there is no point. Before the Covid started I lost my job because of my seizures, my cat passed away, my friend passed away, had to sell my car, my mom passed away and now am homeless. There is more but that's the main things. There has been so much in my life that I have thought about suicide before. That cat I mentioned was a stray cat that I started to care for and I never really liked cats. She helped me through so many hard times in my life. I believe she was sent by God to help me through the bad days. It's just like everything worth living for is gone.

I really don't know exactly what I will do if they kick me out but I am sure it won't be good. I will be back to where I was a little over a year ago or be seeing my mom in Paradise. ",Mission_Star5888,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e41zii/seems_like_my_end_is_near/

I wasted every opportunity,"I’ve been suicidal since I was 13, I’m 25 now, still waiting for when things get better.

My body has been failing me for years, and I feel trapped in my body. 

My mom got a job at a university breaking her back so I’d get free tuition, and I flunked out because I was too sad my dad, fiance, and brother died. 

I got a job at the university so I could finally get my degree, and year after year, my body has been on the brink of shutdown and I’ve had to keep postponing going back. 

My mom had 2 heart attacks, so my husband and I moved back in to help support her financially and take care of the home. 

I told her today I want to quit my job and find somewhere that treats me better. She told me I was a loser, wasting my life. That I want to be sick, that I want to be mentally ill.

At 25, I have no accomplishments. I have an entry level job. I live with my mom. My body is giving up on me. I’m in pain every day. I watch people younger than me pass me by every single day. I’m mentally ill.

Give me truth.,"Harsh truths. Gentle truths. I need either at this point.

I have suicide plan ideas, no solid plan yet. I want to die. Hanging did not work back when I was 19, so don't wanna try that. OD is extremely difficult to do, I'm more likely to just get hospitalized for that. I do not like gore so don't want to expose that to someone by shooting myself with my step dads gun or jump off a cliff. On my list is either charcoal burning, jumping into a cold lake hoping for hypothermia/cold water drowning, or purposeful heat stroke (I'm a runner; I imagine this would be easy to do just not pleasant to experience). I know the biggest challenge is my body's natural desire to live, unfortunately.

At the same time I don't know if I am actually going to go through with it. Maybe I wrote out the plans as a coping mechanism - to know it is there in case things hit the fan more than they already have, such as my mom dying from cancer/complications of cancer.

I'm on vacation, without any actual plans. I'm just bopping around. Even on vacation I am painfully depressed. This isn't like me, I usually find adventure and fun in the smallest things and find great joy in the spontaneous and I romanticize the shit about everything and anything.

The other night, I could actually feel the emotional pain where I did not want to breathe anymore.

Some background about me: I have depression/anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD. I also have a clinical doctorate and do not dislike my job, but I'm also in 200k+ debt that will be forgiven if I die. I have been feeling quite isolated in the small town I've been in since last fall. My mom got diagnosed with late stage cancer and while she made it through chemo and radiation, she has been having toxic side effects from immunotherapy and recurrent respiratory failure episodes in which she has had 6 hospital admissions in the last month alone. I am not close to my dad or step dad. I feel lonely and I have no close friends. I'm scared of living a life without my mom. Without my aging cat. Without anyone. Life looks bleak. I'm tired of being the funny person and the one that looks out for people, but all alone once I'm at home. Silence is no longer comforting, but neither is music anymore. Nothing soothes the ache.

I do not enjoy what I usually do. I want to force myself to go out and trail run and boulder, things I love but I just do not anymore. I know these are textbook symptoms of depression. I have the logic to identify what is going on, but that does not make me feel better emotionally. I love the moon and sunsets and now when I look at them, I feel nothing. I have no interest in anything in life.

Yes this is a post for ""attention"" because I want to spend the next hour reading advice or insights to keep me distracted, genuinely. I have nothing else going on. I have plans to go through with this on either the 18th or 20th. But I also have a therapy appointment tomorrow too and yes I will let her know, maybe she will admit me. Maybe that's what I need.",Important_Plate6912,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e486ph/give_me_truth/

I’ve let my folks know I need to move back home. I’m going to put in my two weeks at work next week, and there’s a possibility I’ll be hospitalized.

It’s gotten so bad I’ve had to force myself to eat. I can’t enjoy anything. I can’t just exist and not have anything to live for. I would rather just end it somehow.

Gender Dysphoria and Hopelessness,"I (18 AMAB) have been very depressed over my gender dysphoria for a long time, and have been diagnosed with clinical anxiety and depression for longer.

My family has no interest in helping or supporting me with wanting to be female. Any time I try to talk about it, I get shot down, told it's just a phase, or anything else except some empathy. I've been explicitely told I'm not allowed to ""Walk around here (home) thinking I'm a girl.""

Worse, my dad recently expressed that he thinks that project 2025 is a good thing and trump is a patriot. What's so worrying this that we don't even live on that continent. It just tells me that he's so conservative he's transcended nationality to support bigotry.

I hate looking in the mirror. Showering is agony. Even masturbating just feels bad, because I hate my genitals.

I have considered genital self mutilation, anything to get rid of it. But I'm afraid I'll be confronted by my family in a less than comfortable manner.

I'm male, 21 years old and living in Italy. I've felt depressed in the last years, but i think that it's only in the last two that i've got clinical depression. Sadly i don't have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist, it's just that my sadness is worst and i see nearly every symptom in me. 
I've always thought about the possibility of suicide, but never in a totally serious way until these last months. Now i'm searching ways to do it, thinking what and if leave something to the few people i care etc.

To be honest i don't know why i'm writing this. I was searching ways to kill myself and found this subreddit, then thought ""Why not?"". Now i feel even more pathetic to be honest, i've read a lot of stories here, people in huge pain and with big problems while i'm depressed just because of problems with myself and my family. It feels like i don't deserve to complain about it and that i'm just stupid to be sad.

Two days ago i was hanging me, but choose not to because i cannot leave my girlfriend alone. She's also depressed (actually diagnosed) and doesn't deserve more suffering, i'm trying to live in orser to make her less sad, but i don't know how long i'll be able to.
She wants me to go to therapy, but i don't think my parents can afford it and probably would think that i'm stupid, crazy or not really depressed if i'd tell them this.

I am this close to doing something,"TW for suicide (duh) and self-harm.

Frankly, I don't want to die at this moment. Disappearing sounds amazing, but me comitting suicide would make my mom very sad and I don't want to put her through that. 

It's really weird and stupid, but for years and years I've just had intense fantasies of getting really hurt and being hospitalized. I have no idea why, as I know this wouldn't fix anything, and probably just make me feel worse. But Gods, I just want someone to actively care for me and see how miserable I am.

Yesterday evening I told myself, tomorrow would be the day. This morning I was supposed to slit my wrists. Not sure what the plan was after that. Either call the emergency number myself or have my mom help. 

Well, I did it, kinda. Not enough to seriously hurt me though. 

I just can't get it out of my head, and everyday I'm in a constant debate whether I should do it or not. 

What I absolutely do not want though, is to get the rest of my family involved in this, and Gods those social workers. No offense, they're just doing their jobs, but I seriously cannot deal with those people anymore and I can already imagine the conversations. Also a mental hospital sounds absolutely miserable. 

Then, make it look like an accident? Be hit by a car? I frequently go out, it wouldn't be strange for me to wound up in an accident at all. But that'd hurt damn bad, and the chance of me dying would be bigger.

These thoughts are horrible and I've had them for so long, but never have I been so close to actually following them as I am now. I just *cannot* live like this anymore. I am so goddamn miserable everyday and no one can do anything about it.

So much therapy, so much different medication, so much ""how does that make you feel?"", so much being forced to look into my future when I don't see anything there, and *none* of it has helped in the slighest. I'm done, I need a break. 

I can't talk about this with my mom, it'd make her so concerned and she already has too much stuff going on, in general I just cannot seem to talk about anything like this face to face with someone, and I'd be scared a therapist would put me in a mental hospital. And frankly, 'talking about it' has just never helped for me.

How to stop active suicidal ideation? ,"I don't want to kill myself but I am starting to feel convinced that death is the only way to stop the pain. I've been dealing passive suicidal ideation most of my life due to mental illness, and it has recently switched into being more active ideation because I've been starting to think about actual plans on doing it.

I've tried reaching out to people I consider to be my friends but it's like they all take a step back whenever I'm feeling more depressed instead of helping me and I don't know how to deal with thst. It sucks because it more or less confirms how I feel like no one really cares about me and that I really am as alone as I feel.

I can't afford to get into treatment even though being in and out of it various times throughout my life hasn't seemed to help since I always find myself right back to feeling like killing myself is a reasonable option.

It doesn't seem to matter what kind of activity I try to distract myself, suicide is always somewhere in the back of my mind.

Stressed out about something that might’ve happened and I’m having suicidal thoughts again because of it.,"
CW: Possible pedophilia 

I just remembered something that happened when I was about 13 years old and it’s stressing me out. I think I walked in on my little sister (who would’ve been about 11 at the time) masturbating to a picture of out step - nephew who would’ve been a toddler then. Or I just saw the photo of him on my sister’s phone, there was no nudity in the pic or anything explicitly sexual, it just looked like my sister found a regular photo of him and zoomed in on his butt and screenshotted it. I don’t really remember this and I don’t know for sure if it was him but I do remember finding other pictures on her phone of similar things that she found on google but they were adults. I told her and our youngest brother about these other photos and she said she just thought they were funny or something (I think) and I thought it was funny too. But I sometimes sort of remember walking in on her masturbating to one of the photos but I honestly can’t remember any of this clearly and it’s stressing me out so much. 

I’m 17 and she’s 16 now and she’s never really expressed attraction to children, she did say sort of recently that Sheldon from young Sheldon was cute but not in like a weird way. But what if she did actually have a picture of our step - nephew and she had it for sexual reasons? What am I supposed to do? I remember worrying about this a little while back but I stopped for some reason, I think I stopped worrying about it because I couldn’t remember how old the child looked in the picture and thought it was someone close to her age at the time (which it still might be because I can’t remember). If that did actually happen, I don’t think I could bring myself to tell my mom and I don’t know if she’d actually do something about it anyway. I’ve told her that me and my sibling are likely struggling with mental health issues before and she just ignored it. 

Everything about my family causes me stress. I wish I could kill myself but that’s just not an option for me right now. I hate this. ",Zestyclose-Baby-9526,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e459dx/stressed_out_about_something_that_mightve/

My mom has been pushing me to get a 2nd job when I literally just got one 2 months ago and I’m still settling into it. Why can’t I stay a kid forever? I don’t feel like an adult at all. I feel like I’m still 15 and trapped in an adult body. I have no social life and I’ve never dated. I have 1 best friend who just graduated high school but she lives almost an hour away and she just got a part time job. I’m very lonely but I’m embarrassed to admit it. Life feels so hopeless. It seems like all my future holds is going to college and working for the rest of my life. I recently weaned off my Luvox gradually over the course of a few months from 50mg to 25mg to 12.5mg and now 0mg so that might be contributing to how I’ve been feeling… The only things stopping me are fear of what’s after death (if anything) and I can’t just be a selfish bitch and leave my twin sister alone. I love her more than my words could even express and I don’t want her to be sad for the rest of her life if I were to give in and finally do it. I have a method in mind but I’m scared it’ll fail and I’ll be looked down on by family and family for attempting. I have a good life. I have everything I want. We live in a nice house in a nice neighborhood. I have a brand new car that I got for my birthday. I feel so isolated but I can’t bring myself to actually do something about it.

Looking back, I think I was having a mental health crisis last night. For some reason, at dinner, I felt a wash of calmness come over me about my life. This calmness is **not** the type of calmness someone should have. 

I thought “maybe if I just go to sleep, the thoughts won’t be as prevalent”. Then I woke up in the middle of the night with these thoughts in my head the loudest they’ve ever been. Then I bargained with myself “If you write them down, then they are real, and you need help. If you don’t write them down; you’ll be ok.” Finally, the voice was so loud I had no choice. I started to write from 4-7AM I was research and preparing.

When my sister died, we had a terrible time finding all her accounts and contacting her friends. 

Last night I took multiple steps in preparation.

·      Made a sheet with all my important account logins (with instructions on specific logins to make sure they don’t cancel things like my cell phone before all those are completed)

·      Located the deed to the house (at least I think it’s the deed)

·      Turned off things like two factor authentication on accounts wherever possible and FaceID

·      Confirmed the beneficiaries of my employer life insurance policies? (Did you know that some policies through your employer only allow you to change your beneficiaries during either a life event or open enrollment?)

·      Tried to confirm if self-extermination would still pay out the above (in general policies apparently do after 2-3 years of being written – always check your specific policy though)

·      What contact they should let know that I self-committed.

In addition to the above, I even started to do one of those online wills. But then I realized the following.

·      I need two people to sign my will. Who could I get to sign this without setting off alarm bells.

·      Would my last will and testament even be valid when it was created in crisis?

Then finally I started writing a letter to my mom. It wasn’t a letter explaining why I did the irreversible; but why I felt this way and how I promised her if I ever felt this way, I would seek emergency help. Then I questioned myself, ""Am I really at that point""?

I then decided to find a better definition of what it means to be in a mental health crisis. Does thinking about self-extermination make a crisis? If so, I’ve been in one for years with varying intensity. Does preparing for the logistics of post expiration make a crisis? We all know that if someone attempts self-extermination they are in crisis. But what about before that? How do you recognize that you, yourself, in that moment, are in crisis and need help but don't have a fully thought out plan?

By this time, it was about 7AM. I decided that I am unable to work today and e-mailed my boss such. I almost slept on the floor of my bathroom because it is the only room that I could make completely dark to match how I felt. However, I did not go that far. I just kept the ac at the temp I normally sleep in and cocooned myself in my blanket in a tightness I have never done before and slept. If I woke up, I would just lay in my cocoon till I would fall asleep again. I kept doing this till now, 1500 US eastern.

I am telling myself I am writing this because I am unsure I need help, and I think I may have to go at least on a 72-hour hold, but because for me 

·      I am unsure I was or even still am in crisis

·      I bargained with myself that if they I can push a little harder and wait a little while longer; the feelings will go away, and then can try and just get through life.

The feelings aren’t going away, they may become subdued; but they do flare back. Even in this moment, as I close out this, I still wonder if I am crisis and need to seek emergency help. The scary thing is what they will do to me, and how at that point, I will truly feel like I have failed at life.

Maybe I’ll stop barging with myself and go; maybe I won’t and just try and push it down again, hoping it doesn’t come back worse because; today…I fear by doing what I did above; I have made it 1000% times easier for me to go even further the next time these thoughts come around.",ThinkImInCrisis,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e43873/am_i_in_crisis/
I cant bring myself to do it and it pisses me off,"Ive been toying with the idea of doing it in my head when something bad happens but it has gotten a little worse over the years. I feel like such a fraud bc i know deep down i cant do it i dont have the gall to. And it makes me so angry that the little comfort i feel when i think about it is not possibly attainable because in the end i cant do it i cant even properly harm myself. I just punch myself when im in the pit sometimes in a fit of desperation. I dont want anymore pain, im so tired of constant anxiety and panic. im an unlikeable negative person who does nothing but leech and has no future. Noone likes me and cant stand my existence. Even my parents dont like me and my sisters all pity my abilities. I always wish for me to hit a rockier bottom so i can finally reach the point of no return and do it. Im such a fucking poser and everytime i express these things no one fucking cares because they know im a coward. I hate the lingering fear i feel, i hate how i like some things in life and a part of me is still somehow hanging on. If i could, i would step on the fingers of that part and get it over with to feel some overdue relief.

I might ruin everyone’s vacation and I do not care.,"In almost 3 weeks, on August 3rd is my 15th birthday. I don’t know if I can keep going that long, but I don’t want to ruin my brother’s birthday just 5 days after my own. Even tho he doesn’t like me, I still love him. And I think he’d show at least a bit of care for me. Everyone is really excited for my birthday, but I can’t keep living and it pains me that everyone else is so happy for me while I’m laying here with my 3 attempts that no one knows off, thinking about making it 4 and not chickening out again. School will be over in 2 and a half weeks, starting summer vacation that will last for 6 weeks. I don’t think I’m able to stay home for that long. I’m extremely uncomfortable around my family. If I kill myself before or during it, I would ruin it for everyone. But I’m starting to stop caring if others care. It was not my choice to be born and I know it’s extremely selfish of me to think that way but I don’t want to live for anyone else anymore. Who knows, might also ruin everyone’s last weeks of school/ work today.

"I am cold and heartless, I am the one who is going to be the end of me.","Whenever I think I am standing up for myself, apparently not, I am just distroying myself and painting others in the bad light. I know I assume shit and sometimes I forget how nice ppl are and what they have done for me.

But is it bad to be hurt over something? I know I behave badly and rudely. I am cold and heartless sometimes. But I also sacrifice, I also do little things out of love. 

I can't say that or express it cause if not, I am just asking for credit and I don't see what they have done for me. Which I am not saying they didn't. I am just presenting my side of the story and when I defend myself they get angry and justify themselves more.

I trusted them, they have broken it many times. And I have too. This all is making me feel suicidal. I have come this far and faced many hardships before too.

But sometimes you know, I wish one of my attempts were successful. It was for a reason I was trying to die. Now I have too many reasons to live for, I have wasted my parents money too much and I have made them have hope. 

I wish I didn't give them that, I really want to die. Unlike in my last attempts. Right now I have access to tall buildings, can buy medicines I can overdose, I can hang myself without interruption for hours but I can't die even if I wanted to, I have to pay back all the favours and money only then I can die, which isn't for years.

I will be counting down each day, till I can die. Probably when I turn 36… I wish I died when I was 10/11 cause I was depressed and wanted to die then too.

If I can go back in time, I want to tell myself that you are nothing special, your dreams are useless, even if you win, even if you come close to completing your dreams you will always be looked down upon cause of your gender.

You can't escape violence cause it will be inflected upon you one way or the other. I wish you tried harder to kill yourself. Once upon a time I tried to fight those thoughts and the ppl who told me that, it's ironic that I am gonna tell myself that again.

Don't trust others or yourself. Cause both will fail you. I wish I died long ago, at least then I wouldn't be a villain or someone who often commites mistakes that are unforgettable and unforgiving.",Thr0wAwayAccount4,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e42t1x/i_am_cold_and_heartless_i_am_the_one_who_is_going/

"I wanna do it, but im 15, is that too young?","I am no ones first person. Everyone has someone, like a pair, and I don't. My gran's (who I live with) first person is my extremely unstable mother, who I am turning out exactly alike. My aunt has my cousin. My mother has my step father. My father has my half sister. All my ""friends"" (Who call me a disapointment and just ignore me and hate me ig) all have the person who they'd pair with iykwim. Like in our friend group, (fake names) Anna has Fred, Naomi has Garcia, ect. People who they'd call their best friends or someone they can talk to at any time for no reason. And I have absolutely fucking no one. Also, why the fuck is my mother the one who's ""sensitive"" and ""has mental health issues"" (She's an abusive narsicisst), when I'm the one who's planned to kill herself over 4 times. I'm the one suffering because of her. But to everyone else, she's just ""sick"" and ""needs to be given time"". She abused me my entire life and is still getting in little snide comments every time I see her, but I'm the one who's ""horrible"" and will ""spend the rest of my life alone"", and ""No wonder no one likes me"". I hate this fucking world and my life so much. I practically just turned 15 a month ago, and watch me not have another birthday again.  And now my mother wants to come to Australia with us next year even though she's already went. And it's not just for a holiday, it's for me: my exams, getting into collage, graduating, and my birthday. And nobody seems to understand me and they all just yell and hit and throw stuff. I have no friends. No support. No therapy. Nothing. And Because of this fucking stupid thing, I can't do shit. My family go out for food all the time for birthday's and special events, but I can't. Because I physically cannot force myself to go and eat with 20+ people (my family is giant). I hate it. I want to be normal. I want to be able to talk to people. I want to go to parties. I want to stay out late and hang around with people. I want to do things. I hate autism. Anybody who says ""autism is a superpower"" and ""Autism is an amazing thing"" is fucking lying. I would give anything to be normal. If someone ends up making a ""cure"" I'll be first in line. I want to kms. I want to. I really do. I need to.

Don’t know what to do anymore / Rant,"
Im 17f, and a military brat to start this off. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve dealt with major rage issues, I’ve slammed and broken iPads, computers, household items, punched walls, etc you get the point. This, mixed with a dad with PTSD (and probably bipolar) and a sister with audhd made home hell. It felt like constantly walking on eggshells.

For a while in my life, the mix of my dad being a chronic asshole and my mom just trying to enjoy her life lead to lots of fighting. A lot. There were months where there would be screaming matches every day between parents, where computer mice were being thrown through walls from across the house (impressive throw though) or smaller things broken. This usually ended with a “we’re getting a divorce” (spoiler, it never happened), being threatened hundreds of times. Whenever I talked to my sister, it turned into a game of rules, what can I say not to peeve her, what can I listen to on my phone, what can I do in her presence to not bother her, which a lot of times ended up happening anyways. When we were kids, whenever we argued we were told to just shut up, and we’ve grown up hearing yelling, so when we disagree nowadays we do just that. It turns into a game of who can hurt the other more. This makes my relationship with her very rocky, we’ll go from pissed to happy to pissed again, to once again happy within the same day, every day.

When I was a kid, things started popping up early, me scratching myself at 6-7, moving onto poking myself with needles when I was 8-9. This only got worse as I went to blades. My parents swear it’s a teenage thing, but because of the ages mentioned I don’t think it is. I’ve always felt this way. A mix of how easily I flip out now, and how I treat myself and others, my family sometimes treats me like I’m just crazy, which pisses me off more and makes me start insulting them. I know part of it is pent up anger, but I’m starting to think they’re right. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I cannot get myself to get up and go to school anymore, I’ll miss 70+ days a year even though my school is only half the average school day. 4 hours. I cannot handle 4 hours of school. In turn, my dad yells. I cannot keep friends, I go through a phase where I’m obsessed with one friend, then I ghost everyone else and sometimes even said friend I’m fixated on in the moment, simply as a “do they care”, and even if they do message me I continue doing so. This makes friendships hard, I’m constantly finding a new friend every few months, even though I have others messaging me asking to hang out. I scream at my family, I ghost my friends, I cannot keep my room cleaned to save my life, ive been pushing for a psychiatrist for years because of my doctor suggesting potential adhd, and a mix of my parents not wanting to accept both of their children can have issues and psychiatrists full on ignoring us because the area we live in is godawful when it comes to mental health is making it impossible. I’ve tried anti depressants, and it hasn’t worked much, and I don’t benefit those around me. 

As a kid I was an edgelord, and I still am I guess, when I was 7-8 I watched gore, I won’t say the website but it was a very well known site. It was a mix of morbid curiosity and outlet, maybe I was partly trying to understand my dad at the time with his combat related ptsd, why he was so mean. I used to flex this to my friends, describe all the gnarly details as if it was something to show off, then I’d go home and watch that same thing. I know now how cringey that was. The issue is is that habit stuck, I still find myself visiting those sites, and doing mass research into any crime that sounded interesting to read. I know it’s cringey. Although, suicide videos always stuck out to me since I was a kid, it always being an escape in the back of my mind because of it.

Now I’m here, I just got done being left on hold for over an hour while trying to get ahold of a psychiatrist again, I’ve been hospitalized for attempts before, you’d think they’d care more but it’s been years of this. Years of being given referrals to clinics that don’t take my families insurance or just flat out ignore us. There is nothing I can do anymore. I feel so done with it all. No one’s taking new patients. I’m sick of screaming at my family, I’m sick of making my friends feel like shit because I can’t message back, I’m sick of feeling my heart get torn in two every time I get a message telling me that a friend is done with me, and I’m sick of being forced through these overwhelmingly strong emotions with nothing helping.

This is probably very poorly written but I do not care, i feel like a broken record and I don’t think I want to continue ts. I cannot believe how much the mental health system has failed me, I tried getting help, and got ignored. They couldn’t care less about me and I’m done giving a shit in a life where no one else does

¿Cómo superar el miedo al abandono?,"He estado tratando de superarlo durante mucho tiempo, pero la verdad es que desde que era pequeña, me he sentido abandonada muchas veces. Por amigos, familia y exparejas.

Más o menos logré superar el trastorno alimenticio, pero esto es lo más complicado. No quiero tener miedo de ser abandonada, pero cada vez que alguien me dice que no lo hará, terminan yéndose.

How to Overcome the Fear of Abandonment?,"I have been trying to overcome it for a long time, but the thing is that since I was little, I have felt abandoned many times. By friends, family, and ex-partners.

I more or less managed to overcome the eating disorder, but this is the most complicated thing. I don't want to be afraid of being abandoned, but every time someone tells me they won't, they end up leaving.

Are there any alternatives?,"Almost all sources of happiness for me are gone, and those left became self-destructive because I abused them too much. My current and future circumstances as of now (3, 4 years) won't be different unless I change my habits. But since I can't do what makes me happy, I can't keep up with the short-term constructive lifestyle alterations. There's just no purpose behind it all. I'm the only one who can give meaning to life, and I fail to do so ever since. But earlier I had the things that brought me joy at least. 

Suicide is the epitome of egoism, and if I went through with it, I'd definitely destroy the lives of my parents. And I'm not selfish to that extreme. I'm already a failure and waste of potential, but I don't want my family to be depressed forever whenever they recall memories of me.",vastwin777,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3ucas/are_there_any_alternatives/
Why do I feel like this,I am 15 and constantly get suicidal thoughts. I have a good life a decent house. I live in a ok area everything is fine. But I don’t know why I just have this thing in the back of my head that makes me hate life. And I go through random depressive episodes everyday. I got close to killing myself once. But ussually people who are depressed have problems I don’t have a lot other then I am ugly but it doesn’t bother me too much. I have my parents right now so I go to them when I get these weird thoughts but what am I going to do when I grow up? What’s going to stop me from offing myself then? Does anyone have any idea how to help this other than medication because my parents are strongly against that. I’ve tried therapy but all they told me was how to deal with the panic attacks and anxiety. It didn’t help much. But I feel stuck I don’t know what to do and I don’t want this part of me that makes me hate life for my whole life I won’t make it.

I have it all. And I am still empty and I want to go. ,"Throwaway account 

I just build a house with my wife. I never wanted to do it but because I had/have troubles saying what is important to me we did it. And by we I mean me. I coordinated everything, worked my ass of while it was build and had an extremely tense and devastating year of 2023. my batteries were empty when the construction phase ended and I was deeply depressed. Then the moment came and we moved in and I have to say that I hate the house. On the one hand it’s loud and build on a place I never wanted to live but if I am truly honest, it’s the house itself. Everything it stands for - the way my life turned out and how it is filled with things I never wanted. I fell into a deep state of depression, lost 10kg (20lbs) since march and was crying almost every day. But I pulled myself out of this hole by going to my therapist, doing sports and then eventually taking medicine against my anxiety. I found some ground again when I was recognizing something on my stomache while doing some woodwork and I went to the hospital. 2 hours later I was in the OR getting operated on my belly. Everything was good, I went home, fell in the same depression and was hit by extreme pain 2 days later. Went to the hospital again and had to stay 7 more days because my wound was infected. Now I have to rest since 6 weeks. Can’t do sports, can’t really move and I am deeply unhappy. I find happy moments while doing music and I was brave (or call it dumb) and went to a concert this week. Wasn’t too good for the wound but I needed this. However there is this constant flow of darkness surrounding me and it just is there all the time. A couple of weeks ago at my lowest point I made plans to kill myself. Now they are reappearing over and over again. I stand up - I feel helpless - I count the hours on the clock until the day is over and I restart again. I am so lost. I hate this house, I hate my life, I am beginning to fall apart from my relationship, to my friends I feel like I am a liar and I can’t get rid of this constant pain. I don’t feel any good. I hate myself so much for this. I am sitting in a fancy new house, with a wife that loves me, yes I had surgery but that’s gonna heal and if I want to I can be a father soon. And so many would die for this - and I want to die because of it. What is fucking wrong with me???

l feel like a retard 😓 [19 M],"I often get made fun of for my poor English skills, which makes me really anxious about speaking. Just thinking about it gives me panic attacks. My classmates tease me about how I look, so I don’t really consider them friends. I’ve always dreamed of having a British accent, hoping it would help me fit in better. But most of the time, I feel lonely and isolated. At 19, I haven’t had the usual experiences like going to parties or having close friends. I worry about my future a lot and feel like I’ve failed, even though I used to dream of being an astronaut since I was four. Agoraphobia keeps me indoors; I’m too scared to go outside, even when my family goes on trips. I constantly think about my flaws and feel empty, much more than just typical teenage struggles.

Living in a developed country where everyone speaks English fluently makes me feel even more inadequate. I get jealous when I hear someone from another country speak with a perfect accent and flawless grammar, and it makes me feel like I’m not brave enough. Even my relatives, including my cousin, call me a coward because I’m afraid to speak English. Whenever I try to speak, it usually ends with people laughing or avoiding me. High school was tough; I was bullied a lot, called names like “monkey,” and people made hurtful jokes. My self-esteem is low, and I think I’m unattractive and unwanted. Whenever there are team activities, I’m always seen as weak or left out when others pick their teams. My parents favor my lighter-skinned brother, which makes me feel unloved and constantly compared unfairly.

In my native country, it was no better. My kindergarten teacher used to make fun of me and physically abuse me so severely that it lasted for years until I moved to the UK at 14. The teachers there shamed and physically abused me for minor reasons, but where I lived, this treatment was normal. My parents were also harsh; they would beat me severely for even the smallest mistakes, never giving me a chance to learn. My so-called friends used to mock my appearance, calling me ugly and making me feel worthless. Now, at my age, people make fun of me because I’m still a virgin. It’s led me to smoke and drink beer, neglecting my self-care and feeling like I don’t matter anymore.

I have always been labeled as weak and a failure, especially by my dad who constantly tells me I will never succeed. He looks at me with disappointment, seeing only failure. I’ve never achieved anything worthwhile; I feel like a coward and stupid too. Exams and assessments were always my worst nightmare; I consistently received the lowest marks. In group discussions, no one liked me because of my language barrier; they often ignored me or skipped over me altogether. I’m scared to become an adult because I feel too weak, and I worry that I’ll end up alone. These thoughts weigh heavily on me, making me doubt my ability to handle adulthood.Oh and btw lm black 
l just feel like humanity has failed soo badly
Laughing at each other because of different skin colours it’s just stupid l wish for a better future

"Trying, but I don’t know what for ","I’ve been suicidal on and off for years. Most of my adult life, really.

There were times the thoughts were worse, I’d thought about how and where. I’d stashed pills ‘just incase’. I’d written notes. Never solid plans, but it was on my mind all the time. 

One night things got really bad and I had an episode that could have taken my life. I was ok but that was the start of me getting therapy and I worked on myself for years. I did eventually get better. I had turned my life around in a way and thought things were going to be good from then on. I was really proud of myself for all I’d overcome. I thought I had the chance of a good life, but it was a lie. It all crumbled. Long story short, the circumstances were all my fault but I lost the thing that mattered to me more than anything. My cat, I’d had her for 6 years since she was a kitten. I loved her so much. She was always there for me and she was the reason I didn’t act on my thoughts to end it, when the pain became overwhelming. I knew no one would love her how I did, so I stayed. Then I got better and always promised her that I’d keep getting better and build a good life for us. Instead I fell for a man who claimed to love me, but just used and abused me instead. My self esteem and identity and all the work I’d done to heal was undone. Worst was what happened with me giving up my cat, only for her to die, which was the most traumatic thing I’ve been through. I died that day too, really. Nothing has been ok since then. Not really. It is all my fault she is gone. She saved my life and I betrayed her.

I tried to heal. I really did. From the outside people would think I’m doing great. I left the toxic relationship. I got a new job. New place to live. Even eventually rescued a sweet dog from the shelter, who I of course do love, but it’s just not the same. It isn’t the same connection. It isn’t enough for me to stay for. The emptiness I feel without my soul cat is too great. The pain of her being gone, knowing it was my fault and she didn’t have to go, it’s unbearable. The anger I feel towards myself, and the anger towards my ex who broke me down and took everything from me. He got to move on without any consequences. While I am left a shell of who I was. I lost my life. 

I have fought before. I have been strong before, but I always had her to comfort me. This time is different. I am more tired than ever. It’s been over 3 years since then. 3 years of trying to move on without her. I don’t know if I can keep trying. I don’t want to die, but I need all this pain to stop. I dont take care of myself anymore. I’m doing the bare minimum to survive. 

I’m just surviving out of shame now really. Because I don’t want this dog to have to go back to the shelter, and because my house is a mess and I don’t want anyone to find it this way. I’m trying to work on organising my things, but I don’t have the energy. Maybe it’s for the best, because I worry about how I’ll go with 1 less reason to stay when I already have so few. 

I’m just exhausted. It got better before, but I really don’t think it will this time. I’ve lost too much. ",throwitawaypo,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3s9fe/trying_but_i_dont_know_what_for/

She's currently in the hospital because she was refusing to eat so they put a tube in her. She was previously in a psych ward but that didn't help her, she still managed to SH and it was bad for her being in there. 

Today my dad found suicide notes she wrote. I am so scared of losing her, I don't know how to help her, I don't want her to die. I feel like such a useless big sister because I should be able to help her but we have tried everything and she still just doesn't want to be here.

sick of this life. ,"I doubt anyone will see this but I need to vent. I made this new page just to be able to say how I really feel without judgement.

 I’m sick and tired of this life. I’ve been through so much in life i could write a book and to top it off, my fiancé took his own life last year. I haven’t even hit 25 yet and my life feels ruined. ill never love someone the way I loved him. i’ll never get to have children now (pretty sure I can’t anyways due to endometriosis) or be married. i’ll never have my happily ever after (by choice, I refuse to find a new partner) i’ll never be the same person I once was.  

I’ve had on and off depression for years and i’m TIRED of it. i’m tired of faking like life is okay when it isn’t. i’m tired of hiding how I really feel. I’m miserable. I’ve tried taking my own life in dumb ways (OTC pills and eye drops, i know. dumb.) and of course I never took enough to cause actual damage. The worst part is i’m scared to do anything further because I don’t want to feel pain. It’s cowardly. Everyone says someone who truly wants to take their life will just do it, but it’s hard. This isn’t a cry for help, it’s just how i really feel. 

Every time i’ve tried, I got so sick and regretted it simply because I was still alive and throwing up. Never went to the hospital for any of my attempts. I suffered in my room in silence. My 2nd to last attempt I research for hours on drinking Visine (yes, the eyedrops). I drank 6 bottles and guess what? Nothing. I felt like I was nodding out and two days later I was back to normal. I was in the car with my friends and they didn’t even notice meanwhile my heart rate was slowing and i was losing hearing a bit. i fell asleep in my car and woke up hours later still alive. Why is it so hard?

 I hate expressing how I feel because then everyone looks at you like a charity case or says how ungrateful you are. I have been on depression meds, hate them. I won’t talk to a therapist or anything because advice doesn’t help me. I will fake like it does but it truly doesn’t. I’m so tired of being here!!! I’m so so fucking tired. “It gets better” Yes, it does for some people but i’m not one of them. I’ve had suicidal ideations daily for YEARS. I want to swallow all the pills I have right now but I can’t even fathom the fact of ANOTHER failed attempt and getting sick. Worst case scenario waking up in a hospital room with my family crying wondering what they could do differently. 

I miss my fiancé, I want to be with him. I don’t want to feel this pain anymore. I’m so miserable and there’s only one way out but it’s so hard to reach. It sounds sick but I pray every day that someone with a terminal illness and I can switch places. I would do it in a heartbeat. There’s so many people who want to live and don’t get the chance, why can’t I take their spot? I’m not selfish, I know how it sounds but it’s just how my brain is wired. I’m tired of heartbreak, waking up every day, having to pretend like I love life. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my family and I know people have it worse than I do, but man I just want to be gone. I don’t want my family to feel the way I feel about my fiancé leaving me which is why I hope for a freak accident or something to happen to me so they don’t have to feel guilt. i’m desperate to leave this world and I wish someone understood that.

 i’m just tired. so damn tired. 💔",anon-burnr,7,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3fa2m/sick_of_this_life/

I'm planning on faking an attempt ,"I live in a very toxic house I have a very abusive mum physically and mentally. She's done some messed up stuff to me leading me to have BPD. I really struggle with all the urges that come with it especially the compulsive guilt tripping i know it probably doesn't look good for my case to say that and then talk about faking it for attention. I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day, around the ages of 8-12 I used to act on it very often every time it was ignored and my mum had completely forgotten about it until recently when I brought it up in an argument and still wasn't concerned.

Before anyone says that faking it for attention is wrong I know this but in this situation it is my only way out.  I'm fully aware of the risks this is not an impulsive thing that i have decided to do overnight I've thought about this for a while. I don't care I will do whatever it takes for me to get help to be better for the people in my life. No one can change my mind i have tried so many different things without it working this is my last option

I've built a nice life for myself I have people around me that I can trust and I love, an amazing boyfriend, and a decent job. I know you can't cure BPD and I'll deal with this forever but I have a chance to live a somewhat normal life the one thing I want more than anything else. The one issue though is my mum I'm only 16 and I can't move out at this stage and I've stopped all my therapy sessions because of her cutting off my main support system. I'm unable to talk to the people in my life about issues at this point as i know i will end up accidently falling back into old habits. I've run away a few times and once even gone to the police because of my mum's abusive even while drenched in water, bleeding and bruised they chose her story over mine this is my only option left.

I need help, I know that I'm a very manipulative and destructive person but I don't want to do the stuff I do and I've finally managed to get somewhat a hold of it I never want ever again to act out and hurt anyone I love I've worked so hard not to act on many of my urges in recent years but I can't deal with it much longer in this house and without professional help. I know I need professional help and I want to get it but I can't in my current situation so I'm planning on faking an attempt to get the help I need.

I just need to know the safest way to go about it to at least get me to the hospital. I would prefer not to mess with meds but I have a full box of valium and was wondering if that would be safe or another method to take a few.",lzur1,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3vhhe/im_planning_on_faking_an_attempt/
Need help figuring it out,"My life is a calm mess. The only thing preventing me from killing myself now is that I don't want to leave my gf alone. That would make her sad, deeply. But nobody knows what I'm going through. I'm usually the one others go to to tell all their problems, to be listened to and get some advices. But nobody's ever there for me. To be honest, I never reach out to anyone. And now I just feel like everything in my life has failed and I no longer have any hope. I feel like my head is full. I've been thinking about suicide for months.

I feel like I don't really live anymore. Like I don't exist in my own life. I feel close to no one. Life has just became tasteless and colorless. I'm not sure I'm in love with my gf anymore. I just take care of her because she loves me. I spent the whole year lying to my whole family (mother, brothers etc) about my life. They all think I'm in another city for college, but reality is I didn't even register. I wanted to business and I had one year to succeed. My time period is coming to its end and I didn't succeed.

A part of me feels guilty, though. That I didn't go through with my plan. That I'm still alive. And a part of me wants to kill myself still. It's a constant thought on the back of my mind.

As long as I have time to make my mind numb with scrolling through bullshit and having a few laughs to myself during the day, it seems like life will at least end without too much effort. 

I’ve accepted that I may never get the job I want, or if I do, I’ll fail at it and end up delivering food again. If I’m an epic loser for the rest of my days, it’s okay, my life will just be a very slow form of suicide.

I'm a mother and a wife and can't do this anymore,"I'm 33. I've been married almost 10 years to an incredible man. My children are 6 and 4. But I've been suicidal since I was 12. I've lived with deep depression ever since. Twenty long grueling years of pain and struggle and mental breakdowns and tears. Living has been AGONIZING. It takes everything inside me to get up every day and take care of my house and husband and kids and a full time job and family and friends and pets. I can't mask it anymore. I can't pretend everything is ok. I've dealt with relationship trauma, family trauma and drama, financial ups and downs, medical issues upon medical issues, and truthfully just terrible luck. Every corner I turn there's a challenge and a struggle. Simple things are never simple.

I'm done. I surrender. I quit. I feel like I'm being held hostage to stay alive. How can someone else tell me that I should keep living or not? Should that be up to the person actually having to live that life?

I have so many people that are clueless to how I feel on a daily basis. I've been able to put on a front for so long. But if I'm not allowed to end my life, then I will slowly kill myself. I started smoking again. Getting very high once everyone is asleep. I'm done taking care of myself. 

It would be easier on everyone, especially my husband and kids, if I could just slip out the metaphorical back door and everyone could be at peace. They wouldn't have me to deal with and infect their life anymore. And I wouldn't have to be in pain. But I can't. I'm stuck here and it's bullshit. 

I recorded messages for people closest to me. I thought that would wake me up and make me keep going but it just felt like another check mark forward on this journey to end my life. I've been getting rid of my things slowly so that it's a minimal burden on those if and when I go.

About killing myself.,"Hi, it's 03:32 AM when I'm writing this. I guess I just will write what's on my mind and maybe feel better after that. So, I'm 16, I have an amazing boyfriend and I love him so fucking much... I can't even describe how much I love that boy.

I had my first suicidal thought when I was 14. Bad things happened involving someone I really cared about. I remember I was crying so much, and then I thought about fucking killing myself for the first time. After that, more shit started to happen, with that I begun with the selfharm and after that, smoking, just to try to feel less pain. The fact is: in the last 2 years, a LOT of shit have been happening to me all the time and you know what? It's not like I'm not blamed for some of them. Last year, I had my first suicide attempt after a breakup. My parents were there to give me all the support I needed and that makes me feel like the worst person in the world. They don't deserve it. They deserve better, they deserve a child who don't fucking give problems. Does that makes sense? I don't have idea. I started dating my boyfriend in June 3 and things got better since then, but sometimes I feel like I'm not enough, and with sometimes I mean every fucking day. I want him to be happy and I'm fucking sure he won't be happy having to deal with trash like me. I'm so lucky to have him by my side but I hate myself so much that I catch myself thinking that I don't deserve to be happy and in fact I don't deserve any happiness. I'm a hopeless teenager whose only future certainly is death. I should just kill myself already and then my boyfriend would find someone better. Someone who don't selfharm every fucking day, someone who don't need to smoke to feel alive, someone better. Someone who won't give problems and will give him happiness. If by some reason you still reading this shit, I'm sorry for wasting your time, friend. Live a happy life and don't be a useless fucking trash as I did. 
I just need a final trigger to do it. I got ways to do it, I know how to do it, but I'm a fucking coward who have fear of pain. I want to die but I don't want to feel pain. Makes sense? Probably not. Since I can't talk about those things with the people around me, I guess this is the right place to say stuff like that. Just needed to put it out.

Lowest point of my life,"Not even sure this is the right subreddit to post in. This morning was the worst point of my life. I got into a massive arguement with my big bro which I didn't even start. I broke glass, I started yelling at him for starting it.

People at my school used to call me horrible names and it's been sticking with me ever since. Every person looks at me in disgust like I murdered someone or something. I just wish someone was there to talk with and reassure me but nobody is willing to actually have a normal conversation with me. Kids at my age are having fun and hanging out with friends while i'm just here on my bed all day. Whenever I try to make a friend at school they either ignore look at me in disgust.

Found the last words,"I can't live without my ex. I cant live with myself knowing I take some of the blame for the relationship ending.

I was immature, he responded to it with cruelty. The name calling, the screaming, it was all a reaction to me being stupid, being retarded. 

But its been two months and I can't live without him I dont want to remember the good past or imagine a future alone so I want to stop at this exact moment in time. Stop it all here and jump off the world.

Just looking out for the day

When you're close to me

He'll understand it. And he'll know it means I'm gone. I won't send it if there's any chance I survive bc this isn't a manipulation play. It wouldnt bring him back I'm not crazy enough to think that. We're done. Nothing will make him respect me or love me again. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.

"There's something other than depression I have, but I don't know what. ","On top of my suicidal urges. I have this weird desire to hurt others, nobody in particular. I feel I might not do it, but I can't deny the thought crosssmes my mind when I'm with someone. I am frankly disgusted by myself for wanting to kill others. 

Whenever I'm alone I have had vivid though brief fantasies, they feel so real and I have this rush of adrenaline from it, so much infact that I start shaking and I can feel my heart beat out of my chest.

 It's like an intrusive thought. I know very well that I most likely don't have the capacity for this kind of violence but the thought alone is still admittedly horrific. There dosen't seem to be any restrictions on who I think on, it's not decided by hate or by connection, it just happens. I don't believe I would hurt let alone kill another human being, but I can't say that these graphic and violent thoughts don't entice me. 

I'm deeply sorry for disturbing you or coming off as some weird edgy teen who should go out into the real world for once. I just feel lost and afraid of my own thoughts. I am a problem, aren't I?

A permanent solution to a temporary problem? How temporary?,"I'm 48. Single. Gay. I've been struggling with my mental health for decades. I've had 8 therapists. Tried 4 different meds (one has worked well enough to keep me alive so far). I've given up drinking, surrounded myself with a great support network who I support too. I could write a book on my own mental health.I got fit. Gave up defined sugar. Get cardio maybe 4 or 5 times a week. I'm popular, smart, funny, talented, warm, welcoming, I have dozens of friends. And well over 10 close ones. I make friends easily. I am luckier than 99.99% of people who have ever lived. I live in one of the best countries in the world for LGBT rights. But I've been lonely all my life. A lot of LGBT people of my generation suffer from loneliness because they hide their true selves from everyone in their life for a long time. There's a barrier there and we learn to live with emotional isolation.I've watched my 3 younger siblings have relationships, get married, have children, settle down. I have never had a relationship. The loneliness for affection is debilitating. I feel worthless and old. My poor mental health means I struggle with employment. I find it reasonably easy to find work but end up in incredible emotional pain after a few months. And then leave. I am approaching my 50th birthday and it makes me feel like a failure. I have thought about suicide at least once every day for over a year. I rang the suicide help line a few months ago. Attended therapy with them. But they're focussed on crisis management. This isn't a crisis. This is the way I live. A life of feeling like this is tortuous and doesn't seem worth it. It seems to be getting worse as I get older. My hope of recovery is fading.

Wish I could get over my fear of pain,"I once again have found myself looking into exit bags and OD medications. The other simpler, n the moment methods just scare me to much with the pain that you’ll endure during or even after if I’m unsuccessful. I wish I could look past the physical pain, and accept that it’s a small price to pay to end lifelong agony that awaits me. Bipolar is too much wait to bear for me, and the loved ones around me. I can tell my friends, colleagues and work management hate me now. They can’t stand my lack of communication of missing work, events, or other things. I reach out, and no support that they can give helps me. I just wish to die, a quiet and soft death. 

I wish I was brain dead, just a vat of meat that goes through the day, outside of the reality of my tired heart. I continue to hurt the ones who care about me. Just broke up with my partner in a manic episode and yearn to ask for help from them, but I can’t hurt them again. Then I think of the one who got away years ago, and I think of her everyday. I can’t even say that her hating me is a personal delusion, people have told me, she’s told me. I’m a selfish asshole, ‘fuck you’, ‘how could anyone love you’. I don’t know how anyone could either. I can’t reach out to her, and I know my friends resent the way I’ve treated both her and my most recent partner. I think it’s time for me to rot in the ground, or sink to bottom of a river. Just let me free. I’m planning on buying the helium tank tomorrow if I can afford it. I’ll pull into an alleyway close by the store and put the bag on my head. I’m ready to go. 

Please just let it work, and not fail. And if it fails, I hope I’ll be brain  damaged enough that I can’t feel this pain anymore.

The fear of Eternal Recurrence,"In 1882, Fredrich Nietzche wrote about the thing he called ""the heaviest burden"", or what we also know as eternal recurrence. More than simply reincarnation, it's the idea that our lives will be repeated in an endless cycle and nothing will be different.

""This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence.""

The point of what he wrote was not to speculate about what comes after death, but to invite us to think about how would we react to such knowledge. Would we reject it? Or embrace it?

Sometimes I think the only thing keeping me here is the fear that what he wrote was true.

"I'm worried, the idea of dying seems to be settling in my head, It's like if I almost were acceptant that is going to happen at some point.","I had ideations most of my life, they started at age 14/15 when things really derailed for me, I expirienced depression aswell as social anxiety, when I was 16 I reached rock bottom I wanted to die so so bad I was fucking mess in all aspects.

With the years things started to get in place inside my head, I wasn't okay but at least I was semi-functional. Today I'm 28 and I can say with no shadow of a doubt that I trew down the drain my 20's I had bouts of depression and ideations would come from time to time. Aditionally I expirienced some depersonalization at times and a very bad period of obbsesive compulsive thoughts that wrecked me.

I left myself be dragged by my own life, I had relathionship that meant the world to me, I can see how if I got any better it was because of her, she made me keep going. But wasn't as happy as she should and left, I don't blame her, she put up with so much shit from me. She did enough.

I'm back at square 0 only this time dragged by the worst mental health I ever had in my life and I'm lonelier than ever since, unlike in the past, now I have someone I miss like hell.

Her loss made me loose my shit, I didn't / don't recognize myself, I tried to do better, did all the shit I was told to do, ALL of the stupid things they tell you to do, I did. Not going to lie I shortly felt better, wich wasn't difficult given the state I was in a few months ago but I never felt alright. Eventually I went back to being a mess.

I'm a crying mess at home, at work, when I shower, when I drive, when I wake up or go to sleep. I lost 22 pounds, I feel weak, snacks are 3/4 of my diet, I've got nightmares, I feel hopeless etc  I'm not detached enough to not see how this is really concerning. I almost end things on march 27, had several intense mental breackdowns, the ideations were crazy but they calmed down until last month when they started to get out of hand again, but different this time.

They used to make me feel scared and desperate now it almost comes with a sense of acceptance. They come I see them and it's like if it were normal. I often catch myself imagining how the scene would look like, I searched how to do it safely, if I see smt that could make it happen I register it in my head.

The night of saturday I drove to the abandoned train station of my village, I sat down with a drink and snaks in front of the tracks at night several hours registering at what times the trains pass. As I sat down against an old wall I thought of death, things I lost and sobbed, the roar of the train against the rails, the vibration on the floor and up to my body and the strong air flow they cause passing by had a total different feeling that night.

I'm really worried, this is not fucking normal. Aditionally I'm scared for the people around me and the emotional impact I would cause on them.

287 days,"Just a little update, not that anyone gives a shit, just thought I'd speak my mind. Shit has not gotten easier. Still just as sad. Even more depraved at this point. Fantasies are getting more frequent to the point it's uncomfortable. The only motivation I have left is the fact that I might move out soon. But that will be after my 18th birthday. So... I don't know. I might postpone my suicide. I might not. We'll see. 

I'm getting to the point where my anxiety evolves into full on agoraphobia. It's already getting there. I think it's because I feel filthy. I'm afraid someone will find out about my desires. I've semi told one of my friends. Only part of it. Only the rape shit. I've been lusting over scenarios like that a lot more nowadays. Anytime I'm alone with anyone my mind starts stirring, and my cock goes hard. I guess it's kinda counterproductive to post ABT my desires when it's so easy to connect to me irl, oh well. 

I've also found that I haven't matured much since I was rlly young. Or maybe I devolved at some point, either way, in my mind I always see myself as a younger boy than I am, and I actually like that too. Whenever everyone else has actual responsibilities they manage to balance, I can't even study for an hour. Oh well. Goodbye, I'm getting bored, and I forgot what else I was gonna say.

I had a storage but had to get a new one cause my old one that held all my sentimental things well they are all moldy. Dead people's things anyways who cares. I shouldn't be sentimental I guess. The universe has spoken. So now what I have left is going into another storage cause I don't have a way to find a home. My truck will need to be towed somewhere because its broke down outside said home.

No body cares. I have zero family other then the adopted dad and I dont give a ahit if he is mad I miss my flight. I just dont give a shit about anything.

"Idk why I’m writing this, I guess I wanted to actually share my story for the first time","So, I’ve pretty much decided it’s time. I’ve got my method figured out and supplies ready- won’t disclose because it’s costly and will surely do the job, with the least amount of pain. Last time I attempted the gun misfired, that was a few years ago and I couldn’t bring myself to do it again.

That was what I thought was the lowest point in my life. I’ve wanted to die since I was 7, I was always different from everyone else, and bullied horribly for it. I transitioned into a girl when I was in my mid-teens. Got addicted to meth and heroin, and I just planned on using until I died. Unfortunately that didn’t happen fast enough and after 6 overdoses I guess I thought I couldn’t die. My family member actually was there with me one time and left me there alone in case I died and police showed up. I woke up projectile vomiting.
By the time I had gotten out of addiction I was an adult and my father (RIP) got diagnosed with an incurable degenerative disease and passed a few years later. I was working in the service industry and didn’t think about school.
 
One day I met my stbxh. When I tell you it was like the sky opened up and everything came together believe me, it was magical. I left the service industry for a better career path during covid, and started to actually make good money. Everything was looking good and I was feeling okay for once, but we (stbxh) were off and on every few months. Nothing and nobody compared to him, and I could never forget him, never could be with anyone else. So after a year separated, we got back together. Eventually we got married, I thought he had really changed. 

I ended up leaving my job to be a sahw. Life happened, time passed and one day he sat me down and said he wanted a divorce. The one person I ever truly loved and could see myself with, the most perfect man in the world really just pulled the rug out from under me again. Except this time I lost everything. Our home is his property, I had no job, no health insurance, nothing to fall back on except my mother. She and I share the same bed because all the other rooms are occupied by other family members. All of my stuff is still in boxes because there’s nowhere to put it. 

I really tried hard to pull myself out of it, I got a new job, got accepted into school, saved up for one of my passions, but the truth is that I can’t even think about enjoying any of the rewards of my hard work. I have literally no friends (none, I am completely alone and always have been. Except for one friend who I don’t talk to anymore because even that relationship was codependent), my family is addicted and dysfunctional, my poor cat misses her father and yowls every night, and the love of my life disposed of me once again like nothing. All I’ve ever wanted was to be loved like that, and I had it. Now it’s gone and I think about the life I’m creating now and it’s meaningless. I think about the future and it’s bright and fruitful, but it’s meaningless. I know I won’t ever feel that way for someone else and there’s no job, possession or accomplished dream that can replace it. My options are just too narrowed as a trans person.

So here I am at the even lower lowest point in my life. I’m ready, and I’m gonna make sure I don’t fail this time. I just really needed to tell someone because this has been a secret I’ve kept to myself for decades now so I don’t end up hospitalized. I’ve really thought about my options and this is truly the only feasible solution, I won’t ever be happy like I once was and I will be alone forever. And I’m so envious of people who can thrive like that but I’m not one of those people. I’m tired of being alone. I’m rambling, I’m sorry. I just needed to get this off my chest because no one knows. I know, this whole thing sounds stupid and pathetic. That’s definitely how I feel right now. Stupid, alone, thrown out, codependent and pathetic.

Let’s just get this over with ,"Someone just one person at least please read this. No one will listen to me. 

I’m 16 

I split with my best friend of many years because she had begun physically abusing me and then I told her I thought I was going to kill myself and she blatantly didn’t care. That was the beginning of the end. 

A few months later, she spread rumours all around my school that I lied about a bunch of random shit, the state I was born, my sisters name, my self harm, etc that I didn’t, but no one believes me for some reason, even though it’s so easy for me to disprove to everyone. Everyone is constantly talking so bad about me saying horrible and disgusting things and I couldn’t take it. So I stopped going to school for pretty much the rest of the year. I’ve been suicidal constantly since this, which was in April. 

Then my parents kicked me out but then randomly out of nowhere reported me missing when they found a paper I wrote before. It basically said if I didn’t check on them before the 20th I’m in danger but DO NOT report me missing under my birth name. For context I had my name legally changed and the original name is my most well guarded secret and embarrassment. Not sure why but hearing it makes me wanna seriously kill myself no joke. 

I said in the letter I wouldn’t kill myself so not to worry because they knew about how I’ve been the past few months UNLESS they reported me under my birth name after the 20th. Then guess fucking what they reported me missing despite kicking me out under my fucking birth name. There would be absolutely no reason they’d need to used this name, it’s not my legal name, it’s on none of my IDs. They were telling me to do it. They got me put in police custody and a mental ward, the worst experiences of my life. 

Now I’m getting further and further off the deep end by the day. I’ve started thinking my pets have been replaced by spies and every typing error I’ve made in this I’ve taken as I sign from God to kill myself. I got super worked up before writing this and usually I’d be calm by now but I’m not. 

Tldr everything is fucking horrific and I’m killing myself tonight.

Idk what to do,"I'll start by saying im 25 years old, I have two young children with my girlfriend. We live in a trailer and a month and a half ago, I lost my job. I worked a very dangerous job where i picked up an addiction from substances my boss and other coworkers put me on to during my time working with them, not to say they are the reason for my addiction, but they introduced me to that specific drug. After a long period of time struggling with that addiction I was finally able to let go of it for a couple weeks before I got into an argument with my boss in which resulted in my job loss. My house is falling apart, the bills keep coming, my girlfriend is the only one working despite my constant efforts to find work. I've applied to so many places indiscriminately.

Nothing’s ever enough,"By all accounts I have a lot of my life together. A master’s degree, a high stress career that doesn’t pay enough considering I often work 70 hour weeks and carry all the stress, but I’m struggling to find anything in my field that’s remote and pays the same. 

Plus, if a recession is coming, my position is about as safe as I can get, minus it killing me from stress. I just worked a 75 hour week and cried multiple times from stress. I work 9-5, then nights and weekends, and never get to leave work at work.

I’m 32 and through all of my 20s I had my own apartment, but couldn’t save anything because of rent prices. The last few years, I had the most awful neighbors of my life at two different apartments, and a roach nightmare. I couldn’t do it anymore, but I couldn’t afford a house on my own.

Then I moved into my parents’ house to save,  but I’m suffering mentally by giving up my freedom. Everything in my life feels out of control. 

And despite saving a down payment, the goal post keeps moving and prices and mortgage rates go up and up and up and I can’t keep up. It will still be years before there’s remotely any hope.

I’m extremely introverted and need alone time to function. Little things keep happening and I never get any peace between work, parents, personal life. If I could just get my own place again I think I could cope, but every time I meet a savings goal I’m still further away from being able to afford this shit because the housing market gets worse. And if I even discuss the idea of just renting again, I get screamed at by my mom and called ungrateful and stupid.

if feels less and less impossible ,"I already decided on a method, now I'm making further plans about time and place. I'm actually excited to finally end it. It feels good to finally prove that I actually am mentally unwell and not just faking or lazy. Thinking about people grieving about my death (especially my dad) puts a smile on my face. some time ago, ending my life felt so distant and improbable, like winning the lottery. but now that feeling fits more with the idea of a normal life, being able to function or having a relationship. I lost hope and stopped caring. it feels like the end, did my 20 something years, worth a try but ultimately not really worth it. as far as I know myself, im gonna chicken out at the last moment anyway, but I like to believe that I'm finally able to do it when the pain becomes unbearable.

I’m only living to go to therapy,"My dad gets drunk nearly every night and picks verbal fights with me, only me out of my mom and younger sister. He has such high expectations for me that once I got a c (my lowest ever semester grade) and he started talking with my mom about how disappointed he was with me, as if I wasn’t there. He clearly doesn’t love me, because it’s a repeated pattern. He even told me “then I don’t love you” a couple of weeks ago when I stopped him from committing but didn’t want to hug him. He clearly doesn’t trust me, and doesn’t respect me when I’ve done nothing but earn and deserve both. He makes snide comments about my body, and if I get (or have) an eating disorder it’s completely his fault.

I’m so tired of trying to be happy.,"I can’t do it anymore.

This world sucks. We’re always reaching some unattainable goal of happiness, suffering through hours every single day just so we can get some dopamine later. I just don’t want to live that way.

My years have gone like this since I could remember:
January-June: Work, classes, sleep, repeat. Too tired to do anything fun because I get worn out.
June-August: Finally relaxing while I wait for impending doom
September-December: Work, classes, sleep, repeat again. 

I’ve repeated this endless cycle forever and I will continue it until the day I die because it’s impossible to break it. It’s simply life in civilization, and it’s come to the point where you can no longer choose to live in the forest or something, but I don’t like it. I don’t want to wait through months of suffering just to get some enjoyment out of life. All I’ve been told is “suck it up” or “I’m sorry, I understand” but that doesn’t give me a solution. I’m a control freak in a world with no control and it brings me misery.

My mother recently took away my self-harming tools and I’ve been at my breaking point. That was my last ditch attempt at coping and it’s now taken away by the people who love me so I can’t even get mad. I don’t think I’ll kill myself anytime soon, but I can’t see myself being alive any further than this. I’ll most likely do it by the start of the school year if something doesn’t change. Life sucks and I don’t want to deal with that. I never asked to deal with that, to be born, but it seems I have to manually take myself out.

Charities and government-adjacent organisations do quite literally NOTHING apart from check that you've essentially registered as homeless (day one obvious stuff) and are aware of where to get a free meal every day. Presumably this is all they do all day and they are paid for it. Bizarre. Glorified directories.

I was on and off various SSRIs for years. Always been skeptical of them but in times of desperation I would go for it. Maybe some small benefit after a few months but hard to tell if it was that or other self improvement things I was trying. Either way, no meaningful difference. Therapy was a joke. Unfortunately, therapy and SSRIs are the only thing medical professionals recommend. ""I know you've tried A, B, C, D and E.... but you haven't tried F yet!"". Fuck you. Another flavour of pill is not going to change me, and my refusal to try is not proof I'm not serious about wanting to get better.

Despite having a long history of depression, whenever I've spoken to them recently they just latch onto the fact that I'm homeless. Obviously its not nice, but that's really not my issue. Worse still, it is very clear they think I'm just trying to score some free food from them and get somewhere to sleep indoors for the night. I've been to A&amp;E three times in five months. One time I was on the very edge of ending it, but they talked me down. The next time I visited I overheard them talking and they flat out stated they thought I was grifting so I left and decided to never speak to them again.

Last roll of the dice was to see my doctor because generally they're more qualified than the social workers role playing as mental health professionals. In addition to SSRIs and therapy she also recommended Jesus. In fairness, my medical history may have had my past beliefs on there which made her comfortable bringing it up - but what the fuck. Won't be going there again. 

Family are trash and not worth talking about. Haven't seen them in years and wouldn't want to. No friends either and I always have to ask myself why. I had them in school which is relatively easy when you're forced to see each other nearly every day. Genuinely enjoyed their company and would sometimes have periods where I would see them outside but it always burned me out after a while and I would pull back. We drifted apart but no hard feelings on my end. I was also involved in a bit of a scandal which definitely was my doing so that finalised things. Met nice people at various jobs but always kept things confined to the office and the occasional work party. Had a few girlfriends but never made it past early stages. The desire to keep it going was never there and I was happier alone. I'd have periods in my life where I told myself ""relationships aren't supposed to be easy, I need to sacrifice more"" and I would always end up hurting myself. Maybe I'm high functioning autistic or have some kind of personality disorder, who knows. Numerous professionals have asked if I'm ""sure"" I haven't been diagnosed with anything but they never press further.

Social issues aside, I have other flaws. I've always been lazy at work. I have known for long time that lack of sleep is a significant driver of my depression but efforts to correct this never lasted longer than a few weeks. I've drank alcohol excessively at points and gotten into some terrible states, though I have ""quit"" for months at a time when I felt like it. FWIW I've not had a drop in months, can't enjoy it living like this. I messed around with a married woman for a brief period despite her having kids and knowing she probably only latched onto me because of family issues she was having. Saying mean shit online. I have been cold to people and sometimes relished in knowing they were feeling hurt. Me simply getting involved in anyone's life knowing I will eventually make a mess.....its not right. This isn't just bad social skills, something else is wrong and I can't make it work despite a general desire to do the right thing and strong aversion to anything outright evil. The willpower isn't there to change myself in any meaningful way.

I've rambled. The burst of emotion which prompted this has faded but the final mission is still scheduled.

Fuck you to:
Teachers at school who witnessed me having a personality transplant overnight and never thought to ask what was wrong.
99% of homeless charities - and homeless people quite frankly.
The NHS. It's dogshit and needs to be pulled by the roots (not just based on my experience)

Thank you to:
My past girlfriends. Love will always be there, sorry I couldn't make it work.
My last two friends. It was only a year but it was special. And I promise I didn't fancy you-know-who. Objectively gorgeous but purely platonic on my end. 
People at work who tolerated me more than was reasonable. 
Everyone from church. Sorry for sudden departure.
The two charities that offered real help.

When I go, it won't be messy. Just a long sleep. Let's see what's next.

All the self help shit, going to the gym making sure I get good grades, going to work traveling etc… It’s all fake I’m still dead inside and feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I feel like I can’t form any meaningful connections. I got hopeful I could recently but it looks like I’m scaring them away already. I’m not even close with my friends but they’re close with each other and their partners. While I’m kind of an outsider but not really. Really I feel like the diversity hire of the group.

I’m probably going to kill myself tonight,"I don’t know if this needs a nsfw marking so if it does I can or however that works.

But im pretty sure im going to do it tonight. I’ve had a rough life if that’s how I should put it, a lot of bad things have happened to me. And for a while I thought I was getting better, but it turns out that was fake. It doesn’t really improve for me. Up and down, back and forth of happy and sad. I’ve dealt with depression for some time now. And the past few weeks I’ve sort of been driving myself crazy. I’ve also not had a good relationship with the people around me. Me and my mom have been arguing or fighting a lot despite my efforts to avoid it, trying to be better, etc. my siblings hate me. They tell me that everyday and they’ve just resorted to insulting me and telling me to kill myself. I don’t have any friends nor do I have anyone im romantically involved with. I’m alone 99% of the time. I have nobody, I am nobody. I am a living embodiment of nothingness, of failure. 

I try to be a good person. I do good things, I help people whenever I can. I have a job and I’ve been in school. I have always made a point of being there for others in any way possible. But nobody gives me the same. People either use me for money or try to use me for sexual things. That’s all I am to anyone. Someone they can use, who they know won’t argue. I’m a pushover, a failure, a disappointment, and so much worse. 

And I was having a bad day again, and my mother and I had to argue. Like the universe had an itch it needed to scratch. And now im sitting here crying planning everything out. I have no notes to write. Maybe one to my mother apologizing for doing her the disservice of being her child, of ruining her life just by being in it. And just a general note of what I’d like done with my things and my pets. I hope they get taken care of nicely when I’m gone and I hope my things don’t just get thrown away, but if they should, I understand that decision as well. 

I know I can’t talk about methods or anything so I won’t. I don’t plan on doing it in a messy way, I’ve cleaned everything so I don’t have to burden anyone with the cleanup afterwards. 

I just hope if anyone on here sees this that someone would remember me. Whether in a positive or negative light, I just want to know someone knows I existed. That I was here. And I tried. I just want to be remembered as a good person that tried. ",StateFormer6241,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3hr1r/im_probably_going_to_kill_myself_tonight/

Writing letters,"This is my first and maybe only post here. I'm 34/M. I've been suicidally depressed for many years, but ultimately have admitted to myself that I'll likely never drum up the blistering level of courage it takes to actually follow through. This, ironically, depresses me more than anything. I feel trapped here, unfulfilled and hopeless, because I lack the balls to put a gun to my temple and pull the trigger. 

I spend a lot of time reading and listening to material on suicide, its ethics, testimonials from those affected by it. It's a morbid form of research, but my hope is that I'll eventually find a way to be unafraid, or brave enough in the face of fear to commit. To me, the greatest possible tragedy is continuing on through the length of my natural life, always sad, angry, resentful.

So far, I'm too afraid to buy a gun or the necessary chemicals. But I always knew that if I ever committed, I wouldn't just leave a note. I'd write a small handful of individual letters to my friends and family, apologizing, telling them I love them, trying to explain. I decided to write those letters tonight, and I feel good about it. Like I'm finally doing something. It'll take hours and I'll cry a lot during it, but it's a step that I can take.

Please don't have children. It creates meaning in one's life the way a pyramid scheme creates profit for its owners. You are merely shifting the burden of meaninglessness onto an innocent child.

In February she left me because I could not handle my addiction issues. I have been spiraling hard ever since. I watch her grow as a person an genuinely looks like she is so much happier. Its fucked up but it hurts me. Not because im not happy for her but I am the complete opposite. It would crush me if she saw how I am right now. I spend my weekends binging coke an alcohol an sitting in my room genuinely tweaking. But its the only thing that takes the weight off my shoulders. It also makes my situation so much worst, when using my habits of porn addiction become very dangerous to myself. I dont know how but I got into exposing myself online an sending dommes money.

I total get it,"Why people with mental health issues get to the point they cannot carry on.

I’ve been trying to tell people how I feel - what is going on in my head, but no one - absolutely no one - gets it!

My partner is beautiful, really supportive, but has no idea how close I am to totally losing it - and I can’t tell him for fear of screwing up our relationship and losing him.

I’m so unbelievably tired. I’ve spoken to work - they don’t give a crap, the Union, my local doctors … it’s like I’m screaming at the top of my lungs, but no sound is coming out.

And the amount of times I’ve heard ‘I’m listening’, then paraphrase and it’s nothing like what I’ve just described.

Feel like I’m being unreasonable and should just try harder, but then fall into the void all over again - and it’s getting harder to crawl back out.

No wonder so many people fall between the cracks and lose the battle.

It truly is an invisible disease. If you don’t look sick, you must be seeking attention or trying to get your own way / out of something.

And no one - NO ONE - listens!

I recently had to move back in with my mom (and her mom) since living on my own is just too expensive in this economy. I was hesitant since the reason I moved out was her fighting, screaming, and hitting me a few years ago. It started off fine and calm but these past few months have gotten worse like they use to. She claims it's my fault her and her mother fights, that I don't do anything she ask me to do, even though I do, and she snaps back with a ""not without bitching."" She screams at me over the smallest things, screams at the dogs, screams at her mother and it's just too much now at this point. And when she blames me, I rebuttal with ""maybe I should just kill myself"" and she replys back ""maybe you should.""

It’s all bullshit. 

I’ve been to various therapist throughout my life from the age of 12 to my last one being around 20. I’ve been to church. Talked to a priest. Went to physical therapy that involved spirituality. I have written, cried and bled all over journals. I have taken walks. I have listened to music. I have taken naps. I have reached out to whoever I could because I was scared I would do it. I have called a suicide hotline. I have prayed. I have manifested. Nothing. Absolutely nothing has worked. 

I was born a crybaby and now I’m 24 and nothing has changed. I have always felt disconnected from this world and it only amplified when I started getting treated like an outcast at a very young age.

i've slowly lost interest into everything i liked, the person who left me doesn't seem to wish to come back and laughs at me every time they see me wounded up, i loved them with my whole soul, i purely loved them

A popstar pushed me over the edge,"I’m 19 (trans fem, which is kind of relevant), and I’ve gone through life unhappy, constantly setting arbitrary goals thinking it’d help, but when I get there it feels the same. Anyways, a couple of weeks ago I tried listening to this singer that I’d heard a lot about, and I absolutely fell in love with her music. I spent two days straight listening to her stuff, and then I actually looked her up. She’s beautiful, she started at a young age, and she is unfathomably talented. In the span of a few minutes, all the joy I got from listening to her music melted into misery as I saw, for the first time ever, a life that actually appealed to me, that I knew I would almost certainly never reach, even if I dedicated every second of my life to it from now on. I have no idea why, honestly I’ve never been that jealous of celebrities before but this singer just broke me. I’ve been kind of on the edge for a while, but this stupid thing kind of finished me off. It’s been over two weeks of sadness and crushing envy now. I’m just exhausted, I really have to end it.

The funny part is, even if everything lines up perfectly and I somehow become the next big thing in the exact right way by the time I’m her age, I’d still feel unhappy. Everything just feels so unfair. Why couldn’t I have been born as somebody else? Somebody who was the right gender, someone pretty, with a little bit of talent and a family that encouraged her to do what made her happy, not what they could brag about to other rich assholes? It’s so frustrating that my brain works this way. With the conditions I was born into, I could easily live a well above average life, but that just wouldn’t be good enough for me, I have to live the exact life of one person out of over 8 billion to even have a remote chance at happiness. 

I just really want to kill myself so I can rest. Either I do it now, wait until the end of my young adulthood crushes the last little bit of my potential, or somehow through some massive series of miracles get to the life I want, realize I’m still unhappy, and probably kill myself anyways.

Damn the consequences with not going to work, I just can't face the onslaught of tomorrow any more even after spending a month out sick this year and using all my leave.

The problem is, if I explain my living and employment situation it sounds normal to good but I have things going on in my life that mean I am taking a step backwards every day. If I am not perfect every single day then I don't get done what I need to and I am falling further into debt with myself. 

I am mentally fucked I can manage my mental health without work and work if my mental health is stable but I can't manage both, one takes priority and it's not me. but I do because that is what you are forced to do if you hide it well enough. I don't know how to explain it to people because they are not like me, they don't deal with this brand of hell where there are no good days.

I am a broken biscuit masquerading as functional. Many people tell me that this is just normal because they arent like me. They dont need to reign in a need to scream, or resist the urge to rip their skin off, tear themselves to peices and hope the doctors put them back together right this time. This is something i actively have to do. I need to reign in a mental breakdown almost every day, sometimes even multiple times a day just to make it to tomorrow.

They expect me to pay it by August 9th &amp; I cannot afford to pay $1400 every month. My loans can’t even pay for it. My parent cannot afford to get a parent plus loan because they are in default. They encouraged me to go to this college for the experience and left me in the dust once finances came into the conversation. We are not rich at all, in fact, we are damn near poor. I cannot express in words how upset I am for listening to them. I was so excited about going and now I am on the verge of dying.

I’ve applied to plenty of scholarships and my parent acts like I don’t apply to any because I complain about having to do them. You would complain too if you’d have to write essays on top of essays and ask for recommendation letters just to not receive anything. Not even a letter confirming that I didn’t get it. I am currently waiting on a response for 36 scholarships, got denied 7 and only got 2 local ones that add up for $2,000. Even that doesn’t pay off the amount of money I owe my college. 

Community college is not an option. I told my parent about maybe going there first because I actually cared about debt and they shot it down immediately because they believe community college is only for dummies and that because I was an honor roll student that I should go to my dream college. Them being my parent, I listened to them because the adult is always right, right? I was wrong.

I can no longer live. The amount of stress I deal with almost every day thinking about my tuition is unbelievable. I can’t live without stressing. Every day is stressful. My job can’t pay my tuition off. I can’t live knowing I got kicked out of my dream college for being too poor to pay off my tuition.",Plane_Primary_2408,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3d288/if_it_isnt_today_itll_be_sometime_next_week/

Rigorous search for truth led to nihilism,"I searched for evidence for god or the soul or the supernatural or whatever. I used to be a christian but left due to lack of evidence and problems with the bible and mental gymnastics.

The past 2 months i was on a vigorous search online for arguments and evidence for god. I was studying arguments like TAG, open individualism, ndes, and others but I find them all to be not sound.

So what i feared is here, nihilism. Atheists that dont go here lie to themselves. I cant go back to regular life because i couldnt even fucking find purpose in the first place, thats why i searched for the past few months. No spiritual meaning, just emptiness.

This combined with other shit in my life like porn addiction and ocd makes it a living hell. I was gonna kill myself in april of 2023 but backed out due to being scared and no reliable method to do so.

I’m stuck and dying seems like the only way out,"Posted this in another sub too but it might be better suited to here:

Honestly I felt so stupid and dramatic writing all this but I’ll post it anyway because idc anymore. 

I’ve been depressed and feeling suicidal for about 3 months now but things have gotten majorly worse in the past couple weeks. I don’t know how I make it through every day, I’m so bored and there’s nothing I enjoy anymore. The only reason I’ve made it until now is my family and my dog. However my family are going on holiday without me in 2 days. This is like the 5th time they’ve done it because I have severe anxiety and I can’t go with them. This time though, I REALLY need them. I’ve tried expressing what I’m feeling and had the help of my mental health worker too but they’re going anyway. My MH worker thinks they should go too and I’ll cope better than I think I will. I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they’re the only thing keeping me going. And while they’re away my dog is going to the kennels because I can’t even look after her by myself. 

I’ve expressed these thoughts mostly to my MH worker who has relayed them to my family but my family don’t understand why I can’t tell them these things myself. I’ve told them it’s very difficult. I’ve expressed the fact I want to die to all of them (MH worker and family) and I felt like they under reacted. Maybe they think I’m being dramatic and I wouldn’t actually do anything, which was true up until now but now I’m in such an awful place I don’t trust myself not to try to hurt myself or kms. Tonight I self harmed for the first time. I didn’t do much and am too much of a wimp to be honest but I had an urge to do it. I feel like I’m a manipulative bitch because it feels like the urge came from me wanting them to see how bad things are. I still have the urge to do more but like I said, I’m a wimp. Anyway I feel like if I tell my parents, everything will blow up. They get so stressed out about me and I know they need a break but I can’t survive that right now. I honestly feel so stuck. Dying seems like the only way out. 

I’ve also had intrusive thoughts about hurting other people. Like I said, I don’t trust myself. I would never do anything like that in my right mind but clearly I’m not in my right mind right now and I’m worried I’ll go crazy and snap. I genuinely don’t know what to do. If I don’t let my family go I feel like they’ll resent me. But it’s not like there’s even any way I can make them not go. So therefore suicide seems like the only way out. But nobody believes I would do that. I’m so stuck. ",imaginaryability41,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3hny6/im_stuck_and_dying_seems_like_the_only_way_out/
Thought of killing myself ,"I am 18 and about to go to college.  I have had thoughts of ending myself since i started highschool and i even told my mom about it (she encouraged me to do as i wish), i did try overdose but failed. A big part of the reason is school, the admission for medical school is in a few days and i can't focus at all or bring myself to study, I am not ready for it. It is my parents wish. I did communicate with them but they dont seem to understand saying that all the money they wasted on me by food, books will go to waste and that I am lazy. I did try my best but curently I am not in a good mental place, I feel stuck again. I don't have a friend to call right now and I just want to throw away some bad intentions I have at the moment. I know I can just leave and go to another college but I don't want to worsen my relationship with my parents.

It’s back,"I am currently 28 and have struggled with the darkness and suicidal thoughts since I was 6.. that’s the earliest snippet of memory in life I have. I thought about jumping out a window. Home was never home. It was abusive.. neglectful and not a very good place. I don’t have many memories of childhood besides maybe a few short snippets of certain situations. In my teens.. I’ve come to realize I was groomed a lot.. I let older men take advantage of me so that I felt wanted. It was mostly online. But at 17 I let a man SA me and I was happy about it I guess.. he was 30 and I was just happy someone wanted me and liked me. At 18 my first time was not my choice I was held to the ground and then held and was told “I love you” so I thought it couldn’t be that if he loves me. Now looking back on the past I’ve seen how much I’ve never had a say in what happened with my partners and I was never asked for consent ever. But I never said no.. I just wanted them to like me. Now I’m 28, single.. and I’ve been working so hard to heal and heal the generational trauma that was handed down to me. I am the fixer, the healer, the nurturer. So that no one has to ever go through hardships like I did. Now.. now yes I am suicidal daily.. but lately.. well more so recently.. at least 3 months now. I’ve cried myself to sleep, or just don’t sleep until my body finally gives out.. I am also having health issues, my liver is having issues.. and I have to go get checked for breast cancer as well.. at this point I am feeling very worthless and done. I see no light. I’m a mom.. my son is the most wonderful soul and being a mom is the best thing to ever happen in my life. I am also currently in college.. but I’m dropping my classes due to my health and mental stuff. I can’t keep up with it all, I’m exhausted. I don’t have a job. So I feel useless even more so now. My son deserves better. I am a failure in life.. and I have tried to unalive myself before.. 2 times actually.. I was a failure at even that… but I’m here.. I’m here cause I have a son.. but today.. right now.. I’m crying.. and wanting to not be breathing. I want to give up.. I want you to finally be free.. free my family and son of the burden that is my existence.",Fantastic-Ad2297,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3hlqe/its_back/

I'm a shitty boyfriend because I push her boundaries. Especially during sex. I'm a monster to her. And I don't know why. She's the best thing in my life. She's my shining star. And I hurt her.

If I Wasn’t a Coward…,"I just had a birthday that puts me close to 40. I left an abusive marriage 2 years ago and things felt like they were starting to turn around.

For maybe the past week, I’ve been breaking down and crying every single day. I am right now. I’ll think of something or an interaction with someone just triggers a, “yeah..

I really won’t be alive longer than 20-25 anyways. Medication is just a cover up for the mental illness underneath. It isn’t going away, it’s still always gonna be there.

One day I called a hotline, but another just tried, I just failed, but I genuinely tried and si think nobody cares. No one has asked me why I did it. Maybe not even I know the answer.

i wish to relieve those that i burden,"first reddit post and i have no idea what i'm doing, sorry if this is a mess or has typos, but i have no one and nothing else to turn to.

20M, and i barely exist, i have no life in or outside of the house, i have a long distance boyfriend who is great to me and i love him dearly, but i can't fathom putting all of this on him, sometimes he acts in a way that makes me think that my emotions are too much for him, and i can respect that. so, this is truly my only and last choice to talk about this without many limits.  
  
i am unemployed and not schooling at the moment - i've taken a gap year, i was in high school when covid hit and finished my last years from my bedroom, where i have practically been almost every day since for the last three or four years. i am terrified to head into college with all these functional adults, and i've been suicidal since i was eight years old, and i never planned to make it to this age. this all means that i have no idea what to pursue in college, no idea what life i want to try and live. with the rise of AI creatives, i have been completely displaced in my (former) dreams of pursuing something artistic, though i'm fully aware that art hardly makes money, and that my skill does not exceed anyone's - i bring nothing to the table to make me worth looking at over AI anyway. 

as previous stated, i am essentially bed-bound - i've been trying to make more plans to get out of the house, but i can't drive and must rely on my only friend to come pick me up to get me from point A to point B, i do not make any money to pay back the gas that they spend, i am a burden and quite useless in this regard, and it fuels my idea that everyone in my life would be much better without me leeching off of them.

some issues that don't need much elaboration is that: i am overweight, i likely have PCOS (and may have possible fertility issues, i never wanted kids but to have the ability deprived from me when my body is already useless makes me so upset), i am a person of color, i am not very likable, i am unattractive, apart of the lgbtq+ community, i'm not very smart, i haven't achieved anything, i am a financial burden, an emotional burden, all of my hobbies that could potentially generate income - i am mediocre/subpar at, i struggle with a porn and masturbation addiction that i feel horrific about, through all of this, i have come to realize that i have *no* redeeming qualities that make me worth taking up the space that i do. i've tried accepting this fact, but i absolutely can't, because i am surrounded by people and social media that constantly reminds me that the people around me are so much better.

all this said, as a very brief **tl;dr, i have no redeeming qualities to make up for the space that i take up and for the burden that i am, and it's eating away at me.**

i'm still learning how to be an adult, like everyone my age, but *worse*, because i am horrifically behind the curve, with parents that coddle(d) me into adulthood, i am overly reliant and can only front for non-family to make it seem like i have my shit together, when i clearly don't. i think that at 20, i've definitely hit the limit for being like this and i feel the need to relieve everyone.",dayluto,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e3ecyc/i_wish_to_relieve_those_that_i_burden/

I can feel my mental state deteriorating,"I'm getting worse and worse at everything I do. I haven't had a job for over a month. I keep hitting shit with my car when I never used to. The idea of death has been ever-present and comforting for a long time now. The hardest thing to argue with is that it would be better for other people. If I'm going to keep fucking up this badly and not contributing to this world, and I'm not even enjoying myself, then what the fuck am I doing here? I do understand it would be traumatic for those around me, but I don't exactly have a huge circle and it seems like the net negative i contribute would at least be put to an end if I wasn't around. However as a biological organism I am scared to die. It sucks that the main thing keeping me here is my own cowardice, although I do respect human life and think it's bad to take it for an objectively small reason. But it doesn't feel small to me.

im 25 and lost everything,"i made up my mind in march, im 25 i just lost my job, my car just got repoed and my wife left me in january and is now inlove with another man. Ive always struggled with mental health, and ive been suicidal for as long as i can remember. I still live with my wife and it killing me. Our lease is up in september and thats when i plan to do it. I dont know who i am anymore. Its been an ugly seperation with her, with her getting arrested for domestic battery, with her telling me if i killed myself she wouldnt care. Telling me im worthless and useless. Ive been dreaming of the end since i was 15. I have nothing. I sit everyday and i try i try to do evrything right and im trying to find a job and im really trying not to give up. but tonight when my wifes boyfriend blamed me for him cheating on the girl he was with and i told her hes been sleeping with my wife...and its my fault and he deadnamed me and threaten to come and kill me...SHE laughed in my face and left me alone in this house to be with a man who has been playing her. I feel like i was left for the dead. My heart is aching, my soul is crushed. She doesnt love me anymore and i keep pretending she does. She just looks at me in the face and tells me she doesnt love me, she only cuddles with me because im a place holder. I let this woman destroy me. I let her kill me. She tells me she cares and she loves me but switvhes so quick. I hope september comes faster. I hope my suffering ends. I'm ready.

If no one save me I'll kill myself,"I know they say at the end of the day YOU have to put the work in to get better, but what's the point of getting better alone? I'll still be alone. I'll still have no one to support me when things get tough again or to cheer on my accomplishments. 

I need someone to come and save me, to take a strong an suddenly interest in my wellbeing. To hold me when I'm having a breakdown and to bring me a bite to eat when I haven't left my bed all day. Someone to pet me and get me to go on a walk with them. Someone to laughing with at stupid things, Someone for me to help as well.

But I don't have that person. I don't have friends, at least none that close. I'm alone. Just me and my cats. I also take help take care of my grandparents that live close by. My mother is in another country, she's dying as well. 

So either someone appears tomorrow and rescues me, or i will do the barely minimum to live, i will take care of those who need me, then the second they are all buried and dead, I will kill myself.

Such a stupid situation happened recently. Had a misunderstanding with someone and couldn't clear up the tension after multiple attempts, and now they're telling their versions of events to people and they're starting not to like me because they're catering to her. I know I ""shouldn't care about what others think"", especially if I know the truth of the situation, but I don't understand how you couldn't when life is basically being perceived by people you encounter. Even if this is only a portion of my life and it's not going to be a problem anymore in the future, there's MORE things to worry about in the future. I will have to adjust to adulthood without being able to have found peace as a teenager because I've been struggling with mental health for my whole life. This past year it's like I finally found peace, and it's all arising again because of this stupid misunderstanding. I'm going to graduate, have to go to college / find a job, work the rest of my life away and grow distant from my friends because they're going to be so focused on their occupations. My mother is also 54 this year, I have no doubt that she's going to be dead by the time I'm at least 30. So, while I'm navigating life after high school I'm basically going to be counting up the time until my mothers death because of her health and age. My sister also has mental health issues and has attempted suicide multiple times, and I feel like in due time she's going to kill herself. I feel like all my peace and joy is stuck in the past, and nostalgia has become something I experience every single day because I just wish I could feel at peace again. Peace of mind is so taken for granted and I would do anything to have it back, but it's just like those days are too far behind me now and all that's left for me is trial and suffering until I die. I struggle with romance because I can't fathom being so in love with someone to have that ripped from under my feet, which I feel like is way too common in our generation. I don't see myself having kids because I don't think I'll be having them any time soon and I think my mom will be dead before I can have any. I don't see myself living a full life, and I never have. I try to be so understanding towards everyone I encounter and I just wish that ANYONE would have the same patience or kindness towards me, but you can't expect to receive it just for giving it out.

Just being with her was enough to keep me going, she was the one thing that never failed to make me happy. I never shared any of this with her. I was so afraid of losing her if she saw how truly broken I am. The past year has been so rough, I know I haven't been the partner she deserves. I've felt so numb, stagnant, so tired and despite my efforts to hide these things they've bled through into my life. Making me into someone I wish I wasn't. She deserves so much more than that.

I want to kill myself because I can’t draw.,"Hi friends. I know how stupid it sounds, but the title pretty much sums it up. I apologize that this also kind of gets a bit ramble-y. My mind is really racing atm. But thank you so much for even just deciding to read any of it, being noticed really means a lot. I will do my best to monitor this post and reply to anyone, but this is a throwaway account so bear with me if im slow.

I’m a 17 year old female surrounded by a friend group full of talented artists. For years I have struggled with this feeling of worthlessness because I lack any real talents. Everything in my life seems to revolve around art, and it kills me that im incapable of creating anything im proud of. My friends and I are sort of nerdy and really enjoy making characters and plots and stories together… but it pains me so much that I cannot put what is in my imagination onto paper or tablet. All of my friends get so much joy out of spending time drawing, and I just wish I had that. I am constantly whining and complaining about how bored I am and how much I wish I had a hobby. I have been doodling from time to time since such a young age and even after all these years I have never gotten better. “Practice makes perfect” is one of the biggest lies I have ever heard. Some people just have a natural talent. Yes, practice is important… but it just doesn’t help if you don’t have the initial spark. I’ve tried so hard, I really really have, but any time I try to bring myself to try again, all I want to do is break down crying. All I can do is compare myself to my friends. I know how dumb it is, but I am genuinely considering killing myself just because I have no artistic talent.. it’s all I’ve ever wanted in life and it’s simply not doable. All I want is to be able to fill my mundane life with something that makes me happy. Something that brings me even the smallest bit of joy. But I can’t. I’m simply not good enough, and never will be. I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to keep living so miserably. This is maybe the closest I have ever been to ending it once and for all. I have never previously attempted, but have had police show up at my house to do a welfare check in the past. I wasn’t necessarily planning anything, but I was definitely in a rough mindset. Im just too afraid to really try, and don’t want to hurt my friends and family, as well as my boyfriend (who also heavily struggles with mental health) because he has told me so many times that he would kill himself if he ever lost me to suicide. I don’t want to rip two families to shreds just because of me…

TL;DR: Surrounded by people more talented than me, constantly brought down by my lack of talent. All I’ve ever wanted is to be able to draw, but im simply not good enough for it. I just want to be able to do something that will make me happy because my life is so mundane feeling.

I’m a pathetic excuse for a human being.,"I’ve always been a sad person, I see pictures of me crying from when I was younger over stupid shit. I’m just a very emotional person I will cry if the tone of your voice changes or if someone looks at me weirdly. I don’t know why I’m like this but I feel so pathetic all the time. I feel like I’m not human, like a parasite that infected the human vessel i am and am controlling it (very poorly at that). I don’t think I was meant to be born, or be a human at all. I am simply not fit to live. I cant function normally, I can’t talk to people without driving them away because I make everything uncomfortable or annoying. I cant even walk because it hurts so fucking much, I’m a failure of a person. I’m so stressed out I have so much to do and I know I’m going to fuck everything up, and disappoint everyone like I always do. I don’t know how to stop this, I’ve tried multiple medications but they just make me want to fucking shoot myself. 

I’m a horrible person on top of that, like I couldn’t get worse. I never text my loved ones, I never call. I struggle to some empathy I just sound like a heartless bitch when someone tried to talk to me about their feelings. Then I starts complaining and expect them to listen, when I can’t even show them the same they do for me. I can’t help it, it’s just how I am a worthless piece of shit. I’m so stupid and ugly, I don’t know why my mother even bothered to give birth to me.

"I trusted you. Now, I hope you know it's your fault.","I attempted it about a month ago. There was a friend of a few years I trusted a lot. They were worried about me, reaching out, trying to help and reassure me. I told them about my trauma. About how it makes it difficult for me and that sometimes, impossible to function. About how alone I feel, about how much I think about killing myself. Trying to explain why and how. Laying myself bare.

Until today.
I was tricked. I was betrayed. This person used me, and now, they are exploiting my trust, using my trauma against me. Spreading lies about me. They reiterated how horrible I am, how much I deserved it. That they will let everyone know about how horrible I am. That they will make sure I don't have anyone left. That I deserve to be miserable. That they actually don't care about me at all, and that I should feel sorry for even bringing it up or existing.

I feel so sick. I couldn't do this to my worst enemy. I am so fucking stupid, entrusting myself to them. I trusted them, I thought they meant it when they said they cared. That they really were worried and that they wanted me to get better. Knowing it's all a lie hurts so much. It hurts to be hated, but it hurts even more to think you were loved only that they just wanted to laugh at you and see you being torn down. 

Thinking I was not alone was the only thing keeping me from leaving. I couldn't do it, I could not live with the guilt of hurting someone like this by leaving them behind in grief.

My bf got strong suicidal attempt(he’s breaking with me for this…*,"What should i do if my bf got strong suicidal attempt?

I’ve been dating him for a while and things always go fast and smooth between us, i can say everything is going quite well so far, and we just past the first month of our relationship.

Technically speaking, he’s the very first serious partner in my life and i cherish this relationship a lot, we love each other a lot too.

He told me from the start that he got some mental issues, so yes he has drug problems but nothing like addict, i know it can relieve him sometimes but i hope i can help him to gradually quit this.

At first, he always said things to me like “baby u are legit the only reason that i wouldn’t kill myself” or “i wanna try to quit drugs for u”, i was quite touched and motivated, i sort of wanted to *save* him, i know it’s stupid though but i still feel like so.

A big problem in this relationship is that, most of the time we have to do long distance, his hometown is close to me but not where he does uni right now.

So last time when we saw each other, we spent 4 days together, there was this night where everything was so good, vibe was alright, until he told me maybe we need to face reality of long distanceand other things.

I’ve always been an insecure person and when he kept emphasizing *reality* i bursted out crying and i ended up crying for almost an hour, out of breath. But he was too, there was this moment that he can’t help himself so he escaped to the bathroom just so i wouldn’t see him crying out loud. But i did hear it, of how he was out of breath like me.

From this i know at least we really love each other and i also told him that i really want us to work out.

But today, he texted him quite a bit less than before so i asked him if everything’s alright, he said he’s hungover and tired. And he said he’s worried about me, for being too attached to him that if one day he leaves me i’d be too traumatized and even ruin my own life. So he’s trying to let me withdraw. He also said things like he think he would *eventually kill himself* because of all those issues, and they are getting worse every year and he doesn’t know if he can handle it.

I cried again, but instead this time i couldn’t cry in his arms and feel his firm hugs, and everything of this relationship suddenly feels like time bomb right now.

I feel so sad thinking about all these beautiful things have barely started but i already have to prepare to be losing them, it really breaks my heart.

I tried to put myself into his shoes, i know i can’t help him because it’s actually not about me but himself. He does love me, so he wants me to be less sad if bad things really happen one day.

I really don’t know what to do right now. Unlike other crisis, this one makes me feel really weak, and my heart hurts everytime just by thinking about it.

All i ask for right now, is that he can live on long as he can, even if he loves someone else after me, even if we couldn’t be together.

Btw, at this moment, i am still waiting for his good night. Please.",PoppyAlbaPulcherie,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e356ok/my_bf_got_strong_suicidal_attempthes_breaking/

Wanting to die at 29 after 4 years relationship ended,"Sorry if my english is not good, I’m european. I don't usually write personal things on Reddit but I really need to get this out because I have no one.

I was with my ex for 4 years, until February this year. I'm 28 (almost 29) and she's 32. These 4 years we always had a good time and we did a lot of things together. We shared a lot of interests: anime, video games, love of animals, volleyball. We attended the same volleyball team and over the course of these 4 years her friends also became mine; I have never had many friends, in fact practically none, whereas with them I had found a group of emotionally intelligent, funny people with whom, together with her, we met to role-play every weekend. 

Then in the last year the situation started to go badly.
For a variety of reasons related to our respective situations at home, she no longer came to my house, and I no longer went to her house. Specifically, I no longer went to her house because her retired mother was always there smoking and we didn't have a shred of privacy, she didn't come to me because my house was always either too cold in the winter or too hot in the winter. summer, because while studying at university I didn't have the money to pay the heating or air conditioning bills.

The problem was that she simply seemed to have accepted the fact that we could only see each other once a week, on the weekend, and only with our (her) friends. The more I asked for a solution to be able to carve out time for ourselves too, the more she told me that, due to the situation at our homes, this was not possible. Punctually when I brought up this topic we argued, because I seemed insistent, and it seemed absurd to me that she considered a relationship based only on this.

Sex was gone.
We went from doing it less and less, to doing it once every month and a half/two, until we didn't do it anymore from June last year until November. 

She just didn't seem to feel the need to spend time alone with me. We saw each other either at volleyball, or with her friends.

In November last year, after yet another argument, we took a break, in which we continued to see each other only as friends doing the usual things, that is, seeing each other at volleyball and on Saturday evenings at our friends' house.
During this break I thought a lot about the situation, and I was ready to change to start again for the better, but in February she instead told me that she no longer wanted to continue, and that if I wanted at most we could just remain friends, because being together as a couple it made her feel bad.

This thing literally broke me open and made me a non-functioning human being.

I loved this girl and I still love her, I wanted to build a life and have children together.

I left the volleyball team and the group of friends because hearing or seeing her again made me feel too bad, so now I'm completely alone. 
I have no friends, I have no family, I have no girlfriend, I have nothing. 
I see a psychologist every two weeks but it isn't helping me at all. 

Since February I have done nothing but work, come home and stay in bed, I no longer function as a human being. All I do is think about what I could have done better to prevent her from leaving me. I'm eating out of regulation and staying in bed all day. I finish work (remote work), I throw myself into bed, stare at the PC until late at night and start a new day like this, uninterruptedly, since February.
At almost 30 years old I feel completely finished.

Yesterday I indirectly discovered that she is seeing another person.

don’t feel like going on ,"I feel ashamed typing this when many others in this subreddit are experiencing much worse compared to what I’m going through, but I really need a place to pour out my feelings to. 

I don’t feel like living. I have nothing to live for. I’m only existing because my parents are still alive. I can’t kill myself yet, I have to provide them with a good life as a token of gratitude for raising me. Other than this, I truly have nothing to live for. 

I’m not the best at socializing, I’m not beautiful, I’m not Asia’s beauty standards sort of skinny, I don’t have any particular talent. I feel like I’m such a waste. 

Sometimes I want to just kill myself but I can’t. I have to wait until my parents pass, as morbid as that sounds. Only then, will I allow myself to do it. I’ve already envisioned how my death would go. Carbon monoxide poisoning, along with my favorite melody and a beautiful sunset.  My country has stunning sunsets, so it’s perfect :) 

I’m writing these here, because I can’t confide in anyone in my life. My parents are going through issues of their own, and I don’t want to burden them with this. I don’t think my older sister would understand what I’m going through, so she’s out as well. I don’t want to confide in my friends, the last time I did it, I could tell they wanted the conversation to end. 

Nobody likes hearing someone else talk about how miserable they are, so I’m throwing this out here.

I thought I was stable. I wasn't. ,"I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

• i feel like i'm in automatic mode, by that, i. mean that i do stuffs without realizing i'm doing it.

• my whole body is shaking and my heart beats really fast.

• sometimes i realize what i am doing, like, i regain consciousness.

• i have huge black-outs.

If he gets elected odds are, best case scenario, i lose HRT and wind up forced to detransition, at which point I know I'll kill myself because the dysphoria would be too much. Ive been there before, before I transitioned, and transitioning is the only reason I survived. 

Or what he has planned is worse and something worse will happen to me. I don't want to be tortured by his rabid cult. I'm already worried I'll be hate crimed if I leave the house. 

I have people trying to get me out of the red state I live in, but I'm worried something, anything will go wrong. And even then, getting to a blue state is different entirely than moving to a different country. We're poor, I can't work due to mental disability. I'm pretty sure we're stuck here.

i have no will to try anymore. ,"i'm going to be 32 in february which in itself is a huge achievement; when i was a teenager i never thought i'd live past it-and i might have been right. i've taken most of the people in my life for granted because i was so swept up in trying to cultivate this image that i was doing better than i actually was, and a person that people would like rather than be the person i am. i tried to forgive and forget the child torture i was forced to endure living with my mother who isolated me from everyone and everything, had her friends monitoring the house while i was stuck there alone five days out of the week, until eventually i was old enough to ""take care of myself"" which seemed to make her think that was permission for her to only show up at the house two to five days out of the month. i was never taught discipline. i was never exposed to social environments so i've always struggled with etiquette. i was never shown how to believe in myself, or accept love, or that i was capable of success. i've always been treated like i'm just wrong, body soul and mind. i ruin everything. im a plague. i dont deserve anything good because i'm always wrong and i always fuck everything up. i've never been able to break through the abuse, and i've never had a single therapist who was proficient enough in their art to actually give me the help i need, because i cant afford good insurance that would pay for a more efficient practitioner. and i wont even try. i to my core, don't believe i deserve the help, or to live happily. i can't break the cycle. i was sexually trafficked as a toddler with several other children and recorded as i was assaulted. i've told nobody that mattered this.

my mother and i got into a heated argument a year ago where i held her accountable for some of the things she did, and we didn't speak for five months after. imagine how shocked i was when she texted me threatening to call the cops if i didn't return the guns and silver i ""stole"" after breaking into her apartment (understand i don't drive bc of disabilities and she lives very far away; i take two trains and a bus to get to her place - not to mention i'm agoraphobic ?? it takes a two day pep talk just to convince me it's safe to go to the store across the street from my apartment), and then when i refuted the accusation she said "" yea you probably already sold it all already so nvm "" and then proceeded to tell the family that she SUSPECTS i did these things. if i was to break into her apartment to take anything, it would've been to take the fucking dog. now the family won't tell me where my dementia addled grandmother has been moved to bc they think i'm some kind of drug addicted arms dealer. there's no words for the shock and grief that's subdued me. she's always been a horrible mother and person, and yet i'm in agony over this. i've been grieving the loss of something i never even had for over a year, and all my will is just...gone. i can't hold down a job and i don't care. i'm gaining a lot of weight, and i don't care. i'm isolating and can't get out of bed anymore, and i just don't fucking care at all. all the work i put in when i was in my twenties to give myself some sort of reprieve (ie medications to keep me straight, a modicum of work ethic to keep a roof over my head, maintaining a healthy diet and routine) i've demolished in a state of apathy and self sabotage. there's no joy in being alive when i can't pick myself up. i need help with everything, and i have no one. i don't even want to try. i'm inclined to ask my roommate to remove her shotgun from the home, but i've seen that outcome, and i don't want that to be the last thing she sees of me, and i don't want to leave the dogs scared and confused, and traumatized.

i can't afford to flee the country, and i desperately need to because it's trying to kill me. i have no support systems. i can't stop grieving. i'm crying every day. i don't want to do it anymore. there's no future. it's not worth it. i don't want to get up anymore. there's nothing to get up for. i'm angry and mean all the time. i've never been a good person and i cannot change no matter how hard i try. i wish i was dead.",krichur,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2t7r8/i_have_no_will_to_try_anymore/

Porn memories from nearly 6 years ago coming back and causing me extreme distress. Please help me,"I am 21 and when I was 16 I was using porn too much (2-3 times daily). I was always straight and knew I was straight but I escalated to a picture of a feminine mans butt (I had a thing for girls butts back then). There was no nudity and it was shaped exactly like a girls due to surgery.

I only pmo’d to this a few times before stopping. When I stopped completely I realised my actions and I had so much regret and for a year I was in such a depressive state as I thought I ruined my sexuality. I eventually came to the conclusion that it was my porn use that caused this and that I am still straight.

Fast forward to now I a few weeks ago I remembered my actions and I can’t stop thinking about these actions and I’m spiralling out of control. I just can’t believe that I did that back then and even though I have no desire to ever do it again, it’s just really paining me to think of my past actions.

I regret these actions so much and that’s the truth. I’ve no desire to ever do it again.

Can I still be straight despite doing these past actions? Or am I not straight because of these past actions?

Thank you for every answer to my actual question and not a bunch of „don’t do it, you’re so young, you have so much beautiful stuff ahead of you. I don’t want them.)

Thank you.",throwaway25253679,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2zgpp/dont_talk_me_out_of_it_please/
Any advice for someone wanting to end their life very soon? ,"I (15 year old female) have been feeling this way for a while now. I’ve been struggling with my toxic mental health for a long time now and nobody around me seems to care about me at all. My mum always just shrugs off everything I say to her yet tells me I can go to her for literally anything. My dad’s worse tho he always shouts at me and tries to manipulate and gaslight me into thinking I’m a bad person every single chance he gets. Tho, he’s not exactly wrong about that I’m not a good person I’m a worthless bed rotter who watches g0r3 in my spare time and wishes I was the person dying in the video. Disgusting right? yeah ik. My sister hates me too she treats me like I’m a weirdo and always acts like everything I say is stupid which makes me feel stupid yk? Not only that I once ran away because I had another argument with my parents and I tried to kill myself. The first time I ran away that night I had a knife with me but, I wasn’t fast enough and they caught up to me and forced me to go back home. They didn’t even care about me they just said I was “making a scene.” The second time I ran away I couldn’t take a knife with me cause my parents prevented me from getting to the draw with the knives in it so I left without one. My plan that time was to just keep running until I found another way I could end my life like jumping into the canal and drowning myself. Well, long story short I got brought back home that time too cause the police were called. It was strange tho cause I didn’t feel scared or worried about getting in trouble with the police when I had to talk to them I felt comforted like I was finally being listened to. I felt attracted to the policeman that was talking to me like he was the first man in my life to ever be a good man to me. It was amazing. But, he left eventually and the feeling I had left with him it was so disappointing. But, I’m not gonna mess up this time. I’m planning to run away again very soon not sure when but I’ll figure it out soon. Except, this time I’m gonna take my mum’s car instead of running. I’m gonna crash the car with so much force that my death won’t even feel real. I can just imagine the cold air on my skin and the illuminating traffic lights as I drive. Then BOOM I crash and all my pain comes to a much deserved end. ",R4bb1t-Gutz,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e33so3/any_advice_for_someone_wanting_to_end_their_life/
Good News! I've finally decided the date!,"19th of July, Friday is the day I will finally be free! I will finally don't have to live anymore!

I have booked a therapy session that day and I have to commute my way there. I will get tot he station and as the train approaches I'll throw myself beneath it and that will be the end of it. 

It will happen so quickly that by the time anyone can do anything about it, I'll be long gone.

This is it. Now I'll be no more and don't have to live any longer. I never had a choice to be born so I'll make sure I have one now. 

There is no turning back and no last minute back outs. No more of that. It only happens in movies and TV shows that the person has a last min moment of clarity or some shit and they stop and then they get help and become better. I regret that.

I keep wondering which night will be my last.,"I haven’t been able to get up and do any work yet.

None of my schoolwork or committee duties seem like they matter anymore.

I’ve been staring at the dxm pills on my desk and drafting messages to loved ones, but I find that I get tired to write.

I feel like I’m living life asleep, I sleep when I’m to be awake and I stay awake for unhealthy hours just in case I manage to gather enough strength to work through the night. 

It hasn’t happened. Not in a month. 

I’m in so much pain that I’m numb, I can’t even cry.

I just wanted to tell you, since no one else knows I’m planning on dying soon. I’ve ended all my conversations with a smile, hopefully.

I’m going about everything in the middle. Like I’m doing things and saying “this is the last time I’ll ever see or do this” but at the same time I’m worried about the future.

I’m so tired of explaining myself, and trying to understand things. I’ll leave my notebook next to me when I go, even if it’s hard to decipher without annotation. 

I hope that even if no one can understand me—-
I just hope my writing would show people that I was never just a character. 

That I wasn’t just two dimensional, and that I tried my best to keep my mess away from others.

Should i kms?,"TW: SA, CSA

Hii im \[20, F\] actually thinking about commiting bcs i feel my life has come to the point where i cannot keep going. Ill explain, i had an extremely sad and rough life which has caused me trauma and personality disorders such as bpd. I was s3xually abus3d as a child (cocsa) and as a teenager by older teenagers. This led to several identity issues for me with my sexuality. i became fixated on sex by age 6, which only made my situation worse as i would try to have sex with people and the only people who would have me were pdf files.  I became exposed to pdf files and pdf file p0rn by some of my abusers by age 13. my mouth was r4ped at that age and i developed an oral fixation. I became addicted to smoking cigarettes and marijuana, also took a bunch of drugs and acohol during my teenage years, as one does, and i developed an addiction to benzos. i started to sell pics of myself to pay for my addiction. This benzo addiction kept going until i was 18 and my family sent me to rehab. I recovered and had to be put on medication for my issues. abilify and prozac, i take them to this day. I also had an ED during my adolescence and self harm issues. I am now recovered but i ache greatly as i want to feel how i felt before, i felt alive. I have gained like 40 kgs since my ed and i wish i could go back to how my body was since i no longer find myself cute or fuckable. i dont go outside anymore, i dont have “friends“ to “hang out with”, i have a psychiatrist and psychologist but nobody else to talk to. I only stay at home and play online (Dont have online friends either). I am extremely unbearable in relationships so nobody will put up with me, i am also ugly so its hard enough. should i just off myself as i am clearly in for a long life of suffering? My memory will not cease and i cannot forget how good having friends and taking drugs felt, or how greatly being loved by someone feels like. i still havent finished school yet because im a loser who failed chemestry and its been years since. should i just kms?

Passively suicidal,"I dont feel like i deserve the gift of life . Basically, i got with this girl, which was my my mates ex, breaking bro code. I did so bc of a mixture of loving her as a person, greed for my own self, and the fact i felt sorry for her as his ex allgedly violated her(not true and it fucked me over, you'll find out soon). It was smooth sailing for the first week, chill, no drama, but since the group found out abt us being together, they aint happy. As a result I pressured her to let me expose him of his alleged crime to the group. They called cap, kicked us out. She got very upset, so much so that on our date, i had to stop her from scratching herself (self-harm) because of it. I thought i was in the right all this time, even kids helpline said it was violation. Keep in mind she has past trauma, and she had not been shaking and being this stressed since it. 

She then called the cops and they said it wasn't S/A, for a valid reason which both of us had overlooked. We then apologised to the group, and she left me on her own accord, which i accepted. Not only have i caused her to legit stress about this, making her want to disappear (she is moving schools bc of this), but ive almost caused the mate i stole her girl from to commit suicide, as i yelled at him with not very nice language abt this when confronting him, threatening to blackmail him and mentally tortured him. Sure the last bit was my fault; the group hates me and her now. I feel that it was all 100% my fault, even though i was only trying to pass the message on. Ive caused her and her ex emotional damages beyond my comprehension. 

Ive had a panic attack about this too. This is not the only incident i have hurt people, as i used violence alot, bullied, and was an overall dick to alot of people last year. I thought this one i was gonna change, but ive only repeated my mistakes, and my reputation at school was already bad enough, but now i'd rather rot at home and learn nothing than have to deal with all this.

what’s the point,"i know someone if not all of y’all will tell me to just leave and be done with it but i cannot physically bring myself to do that yet so please, please don’t. “i know you said not to but you gotta leave” no i don’t want to hear that i just want to know that i’m not insane right now without being pressured into doing something like that, maybe i’ll be able to leave on my own.

that being said, my relationship with my SO is great, i love him a lot, he’s usually affectionate and appreciative of me.

but then he gets in these moods. he’s got depression that tends to come and go. when he’s depressed he blames me for every problem that HE caused in our relationship.

he cheated on me (if you can call it that, he stayed texting random bitches who live across the country from us) … we fought a LOT about it but stayed together. he’s shown me he’s sorry, and he’s the one who came out and told me about it on his own. i didn’t find it or nothing.

his problem with all that though is that i was “so angry” and when he’s depressed he says he thinks about it and can’t let it go. i understand that, i slapped him as hard as i could across the face. but fuck man, how would you respond?

oh, and the fact that his mom and family found out about this and hate ME??? not for the slap, i don’t know if they even know about it. because i was so angry at him even though i stayed with him. i was angry so i said a lot of hurtful shit. i get that. i fucked up.

but he always acts like we’re past it when he’s happy. couples go through shit, right?

i really have no purpose if not for him. all i do it work, cook food for him (i’ve realized that’s my love language) and try and help him with his dream career. he works a more physical job while working on his career on the side. the only chore i ask him to do is the dishes. we both are working now to save up money, he said once i’m pregnant and i can stop working if i want and he’ll provide. i’m happy with that.

but right now he’s in one of those depressed moods. and i’m feeling it right now too. more than normal. i know this will pass like every other time. but i’m so tired, man…

I feel so fucking alone,Ever since 2020 I've felt more and more disconnected from society and people at school especially after what happened at home where my dad beat my mom. I feel so guilty for only making things worse for my mom and being against her instead of with her while she was being abused by my father. I feel like I've been an asshole to everyone who's ever tried to help me and I feel like sometimes I just bring misery into this world. I feel spurts of productivity sometimes but then I feel really depressed and alone. I just want someone who I feel like I can open up to and love. I just don't know if I can go to my mom as I don't feel comfortable opening up to her and I genuinely think that her life would've been better if she never met my dad and thus never had me. I've done so many awful things and I think that maybe I'm just a bad guy. I wish I was never born so then I nobody would be hurt from me and I wouldn't feel this hurt. I feel like I've caused so much pain to my mom and I just want her to be happy. I feel empty a lot of the time and things don't fulfill me like they used to. I'm not sure if things will ever get better sometimes because sometimes it feels like life is going in a loop. I feel so betrayed by my father because I loved him so much but he just kept abusing me and my mother and it hurts so much to think about how he never really loved me even though I loved him. Sometimes I envy my sister because she never had to live through any of this since she died at birth. I'm always too scared to kill myself and sometimes I feel better so it makes me hopeful but then it fluctuates a lot.

I’m going to kill myself on my birthday in a few weeks time,"How do you tell everyone around you that you’re terminal? I have everything planned. I am going to make sure I am at peace this time. Nobody knows at all. (I’ve struggled with co morbid mental health issues my whole life. I can remember feeling immense anxiety, depression and suicidal from as early as 5 years old). I will be 35 this year on my birthday. I feel like I’m drowning and I’m exhausted. I just can’t fight anymore. It felt good knowing I had a date planned. I have had so for the past 2 months or so. I thought with that slim bit of hope that I would find reasons to stay. It’s the opposite, every day I beg myself to put myself out of my misery sooner.

...I don't know what to do. ,"I'm done. I don't want to do this anymore, lol. I can't control my emotions, I don't have a grip on life, motivation (what is that?,) I don't want to physically talk to anyone about it, I just want to be gone. I don't know. I'm not particularly sad about anything, nor am I angry anymore. Like many of you, I've been through hell too and I used to cry for hours and pity myself about everything. I was disgusted in myself and my family for many yucky reasons but now.. it's like there's nothing? 

I have no desire to work, eat or actually LIVE, you know? I've been passively suicidal for about 7 years, going on 8 years in roughly a month and I'd usually cry, think about dying, maybe some SH and then I'd go to bed but tonight.. somethings different. I literally just had a cry but it only lasted like 5mins or so and now I'm completely neutral.  I still do not want to be alive but I don't have the overhelming urge to jump off a building or drive my car into the gas lines. I think I'm just.. done.. I don't feel anything????? But I like it??? 

It's peaceful but I feel off at the same time. Like.. this isn't right.. I'm so confused. help me?? Can you?? Advice, anyone?? I feel happier, I guess.. I think?? There's nothing so I'm not sure.

Keeping it simple. I just don't like being alive.,"People always tell me to keep living this, and don't kill yourself that, but honestly, for what? I'm gonna die anyway. We're living in a world that's run by hatred, evil, and selfishness. I don't really want to live in a world like that. I often find myself pondering about my life, thinking to myself, is there really a point to continue living? Even if I get what I want, how long will I stay satisfied? Whenever I'm having fun, eventually it ends. Whenever I'm relaxing or chilling out, eventually it ends. Everything is temporary, and honestly it's just really boring. Even the few things that still excite me to this day have a weaker effect on me than it did years ago. Maybe it's because my life's just been on a downwards spiral ever since I graduated high school. Maybe I just lost any and all passion of living. I'll admit, I made a lot of messed up decisions and probably wouldn't be as suicidal as I am now if I didn't mess up immensely, but to be honest? I'm in a state to where I really just don't want to deal with anything anymore. I'm not even upset about it either, although I have Major Depressive Disorder. I just don't really feel anything, and in a way that's worse than being straight-up sad or depressed. Maybe I'll feel something when I die? Maybe in death, I'll start feeling again? Death, unlike anything else, is permanent, and maybe it's exactly what I'm looking for. A break from the mundane. The routine. A way for me to escape my haunted past, perhaps.",MajorRobology,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2tzjm/keeping_it_simple_i_just_dont_like_being_alive/

How do I open up to someone about my thoughts? I want to get help.,"Years ago I first started developing depression and anxiety symptoms due to bullying and stress in school, mainly due to being neurodivergent. It made my life a living hell because I had no friends and my own family would call me r3tarded or say I was “acting dramatic” if I tried to open up. If I showed any deeper symptoms, they’d tell me I’d get locked up in “The Loony Bin” where I’d be strapped down to a bed and pumped full of pills like a slave. Hearing that was already terrifying enough, but to hear very real and very similar incidents happen to people I knew didn’t make it any better.

None of them know this, but I almost went through with overdosing one night in the 7th grade due to a humiliating incident that turned out to be my breaking point. For whatever reason, I just couldn’t go through with it. Maybe it was my dog or my few online mutuals on PopJam, but instead, I just cried myself to sleep and foolishly hoped that I wouldn’t wake up the next morning. I had a similar incident due to an ex, but that was less severe I think. 

My family would always tell me that “depression was temporary and it’ll go away on its own” but it never did for me.

Years later those thoughts just became passive. I didn’t want to kill myself, but at the same time I didn’t care what happened to me anymore. I didn’t care if I got kidnapped, or got run over, or anything like that. As long as it was quick I wouldn’t mind. There were times I would walk on bridges and have intrusive thoughts about jumping off. 

Even when going through diagnosis stuff and even when some people asked, I could never tell the full truth that I had suicidal thoughts. The idea of being abused, assaulted and cut off from the rest of the world in a closed facility was a concept worse than death to me. Even prisoners had more rights than that. It was essentially a punishment for not getting the job done yourself, run by people that only saw broken individuals as trash to be repurposed instead of fixed.

But I’m tired of living in mental exhaustion everyday, waiting for something else to kill me. I’m tired of not knowing what I want to do with myself one day and feeling like I’m just a useless background character in everyone else’s life. I actually have a few people I care about and want to stay for. But I don’t want to keep living like this anymore and I don’t know how to change the way I feel. I’ve tried getting out more and getting into hobbies but they’re never permanent solutions to the pain. I want to tell someone so maybe they’ll finally understand why I am the way I am. But I don’t want to risk being tortured if I say the wrong thing or too much. If anyone has any advice, I’d appreciate it.

I'm losing hope in humanity and things just keep getting worse,"I just want to state I'm doing okay in terms of a place to work and a house to stay at. I'd say I'm dealing with less stress than the average person working in the US. The issue is I'm breaking mentally when I thought I overcame some of my biggest problems that held me down. I use to deal with a lot of depression and anxiety. It held me back horribly and I tormented myself In the past thinking how the way people treat me I must deserve to suffer. I thought that maybe I had done something so horrible in a past life that I absolutely deserved the hurtful things friends would do to me. I'd lay in night crying about how I would be better off if I had disappeared and the only thing that stopped me was not wanting to end my life just out right sense who knows where you go and what damage I would cause to people finding out I killed myself. Even my family treated me horrible as a kid I know I was not raised well. I wasn't raised horribly but I still went through stuff that caused me to develop how I felt about how I deserved to suffer. I know it was what caused my anxiety. Even back then when I expressed my severe panic attacks no one tried to help. They even found out I was cutting cause I tried getting help through a suicide hotline who just threw cops my way so I had to get cuffed and sent to a mental hospital. Explains why I don't go there for help anymore.

Of course I no longer face this exact challenge of hating myself. I actually have grown to accept the things I like and and who I am. I have bought things I like to look at like art and just stuff that would help me. Ultimately I begun taking care of myself and loving myself. With all of this it was very impowering I felt good about life. The last time I felt depression/anxiety was 5 months ago when my bestfriend who I talked to everyday for a year started ghosting me. She had moved back home and shortly after the energy we equally put in started halting. I gave it time thinking oh she just wants to be with family for a bit. A month passed. I had grown to hold a lot of anxiety and concern the friendship was ending. I expressed my feelings of how ever sense she moved back home I felt I wasn't someone she liked anymore. Like I was just used to pass the time she was away from home. I only received deflections and how my comment hurt her. I was just shocked.

What made all of this worse is I had just helped this friend get a new pc with a good amount of money. Money I was anxious to spend but there were no issues in the friendship prior. We always worked things out we always played games and did voice chat. When she needed someone to vent to I tried to be there for her. I gave her advice helped her away from bad friends. Showed her how to be more positive and get through work. I put so much into it and I loved it. That friend felt like a sister to me that I didn't have. Just like that though I was no longer even a thought to them. They said they would pay me back first. They ended up paying others back first. I asked them about it. They said how I told them they could take their time. I did. Though there was absolutely desire being shown to pay me back. 2-3 months in no money was given back. I was dying over this. I spent a year with this person almost daily sharing so much. Now I'm not only not worth talking to but I'm not even worth getting the money back that I so kindheartedly loaned. Remembering hearing how she looked up to me so much. Hearing how I helped so much. So I guess it wasn't meant at all. Or they liked my actions but not me as a person. Eventually I had looked into stuff and my mind switched. I was done treating myself bad over all the stuff that went wrong.

I started taking care of myself and buying things for myself. It honestly didn't feel as good but I know it was helping and after sometime I realized how horrible those close friends were to me. So I started trying to better determine my friends and started a goal of staying out of friendships that had drama. Anyone who I had issues with I put a long stick between us at the very least. This horrible event at least gave me room to treat myself better. Then it started. I started realizing how sickening it was for people to treat such a sweet person like that. To selfishly use me like that. Use me as a wallet. Use me for emotional validation. Use me to fill in their boredom. Most of the closest people hurt me the most. Said some of the most vial things I had heard. It all ended on such bad terms. It made me question if I should have anymore close friends. Shortly after someone who I considered a friend started trying to make me mad. I knew what they were doing cause they started instigating things. They even expressed how they were trying to instigate. I can't just leave this friend because a good friend hangout with him. I'd have to leave as a whole.

All of these little details all of these little actions that I saw in people. I saw how sickening we are as Humans. We steal from people who love us. We use them like tools. We do anything to make ourselves feel better even if it means someone dies. What was unbearable an amount of depression and anxiety is now an unbearable amounts of anger building up more and more. I knew how everyone close to me treated me so disgusting. No one sacrificed anything for me. No one did anything that was at their inconvenience. No one in this world wants to be understanding. No one wants to put in the same effort all the time. My friend group is getting smaller and smaller. I don't make anymore friends. So it just seems like a painful process of me losing all my friends in some disgusting way eventually and I'd have no way of know sense most just switched up on me. Where they take advantage of me or use me in any kind of way. Where at the end of it my health is never a concern to them. Its disgusting how much stuff I dealt with that was horrible as someone with such a big heart.

Now I don't know who to trust anymore. I don't know whos going to toy with me next. I know I can't make any friends not that I don't talk to people but because I'm such a different person from everyone else. My interests are niche and very few people ever know them. No one really gets my way of joking a lot and Im so spastic. I have a lot of energy and I just act dumb because its fun. I don't hate me for this but I know the way I am doesn't bring anyone in which as a human is making me feel very lonely. So while I'm losing people there is absolutely no one showing up in life. I'm growing up and I know less and less people will like my way of joking and interests. Its just saddening cause I use to love people and I wanted to give someone the most a human could. I wanted to experience true love. The closer I got to this it felt like life was stabbing me in the most painful way it could. People I thought I knew who lured me in only to use me and throw me away.

So despite wanting to love people and care for people and help I now Just feel so much disgust and hatred. I'm so full of anger and it gets worse everyday. I stay physically active to hopefully burn off this anger but I can still feel it there. Even if I manage to get it out of my mind during it comes back. Its just there. I'm so disgusted by what Human do. It feels like truly humanity was never full of love. It was never a place with good people. I just hate how no one cares. Whats the point. Whats my purpose. I just want to say fuck it and leave everything. I don't want to deal with this shit anymore. Getting close to someone just means a big chance at me getting screwed over in some way. I don't know how to feel or what to do now. everything is just feeling worse. I just feel like blowing my brains out. There is no good here. I won't even feel that happiness i did from friends in anything else and I've been trying. I want to be happy but I can't find anything to distract me away from this anger like those friendships did. I love my hobbies and interests but I'm not a fueled to them. At least when i do them yes I enjoy it but this anger comes back.

I'm so sick of it. Its tormenting. You think you make it into a peaceful happy life then either someone or life itself kicks you down as soon as you get better. I just don't want to be here anymore. Not even cause I hate myself. I actually want myself to be okay so just imagining ending it all being free from this painful headache. From all the sickening humans out there. That sounds lovely. Its sound like that would be the only thing I'd have to finally put my mind at rest. No more emotions that take over my life. It would be fine if I could be okay for a whole year without breaking down so bad like this. But i don't ever get that. Sense 13 my like has just felt like shit. I don't know how to feel anymore. Yeah maybe I can ride this out but ya know when you actively snap into a positive mindset finally and then anger comes along to kick it out. Well whats the point. All of that work is gone. Its obviously impacting my friendships and even work. I can't talk to people when the thought of blowing my head of is in my mind or when the crippling disgust of all the horrible things people have done to me is catching up. I'm just so annoyed now. I haven't hurt anyone but I've just stopped showing up. Only 2 fucking people would care about where I am and the other would be concerned about me.

Well I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't really have anyone to go to with this. Its funny I wanna give up on Humanity and stop relying on people but I'm here. I just want peace really. Also if anyone is concerned please don't have police show up again. That actually caused me to lose a lot of trust too. Maybe I'm just paranoid now cause how would they tap my stuff on here but whos knows. Just send the police to deal with the guy who needs comfort and care. I know it would be expecting a lot for some to read and respond sense nothing is ever really free but yeah. Well thanks if anyone does. I'm gonna lay down and hope I can swiftly fall asleep before it gets even worse.",Fluffy_Tax1711,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2qav2/im_losing_hope_in_humanity_and_things_just_keep/
How does everyone feel so much?,"What I can’t understand is how people have such strong feelings. They have the motivation to get up, to feed and clothe and wash themselves, to go to a job, to heal themselves when they’re ill. And the people who are suicidal - they feel hate towards themselves, or the world, or sadness.

I just feel nothing. I look at the world and I just think what is inspiring about that. I have no idea why the average person gets up in the morning because I am one of them and none of this feels worth trying for to me. It all just feels so pointless - it’s so much effort to stay alive and for what exactly? A boring world full of boring mundane days and tasks, the same social interactions over and over. I just don’t care? 

I feel like people expect depression to be strong feelings of sadness but I wish I could feel that because I don’t even gaf enough to look after myself. I just think the world is overrated in the same way you might look at a supermarket offer and think “not good value for money”. 

I’m alive for my family but that’s their feelings, not mine - I think staying alive for the potential of a few specific happy moments is just illogical when the rest are shit. ",absolutethrowaway77,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2rm6s/how_does_everyone_feel_so_much/

I was working along those things consistently for a month, it tapered off in the 2nd, before i finally lost motivation. I slumped. I spent the last month's worth of weekends rotting on my bed.

It's been 3 months since we broke up. This is really bad. My career is now struggling and it's very irresponsible of me to burden my teammates for personal reasons but i just can't function.

I think i need someone to push or coach me but realistically, I'm 26. There's no one to do that for me anymore. I'm an adult. 

I don't know how to go on. I miss her so much and i am incredibly lonely. I don't know who to seek and I don't want to go back to my old friends, after so long, just to let them hear me whine. It'll be as if i am only there when i need an emotional bolster.

I have already processed things and formed conclusions on how it wont work out if we were together and how she was not good for me. But this didn't help at all to making me miss her less, it only rationalised why i am here, not solve the pain. I also processed my shortfalls but my fear is the inability to grow from it and my current dysfunctionality is validating that fear. There are aspects in my life which were like this for a decade: where i couldn't grow in no matter how much i tried.

I'm 20 (f) and have been depressed since I was 14, have very bad social anxiety ever since I could remember &amp; to top it off I am autistic. 

these days, the only thing that really makes me happy is smoking weed &amp; occasionally taking other drugs. I've just started a new job &amp; even though I'm proud of myself for finally doing something with my life (I graduated 3 years ago) I hate myself for being so stupid and anxious at work. I lay in bed all day, scrolling on tik tok or instagram, distracting myself from living. I don't have any friends &amp; I do have a boyfriend, but I'm not that happy when I'm with him either. besides work I don't do ANYTHING and it's frustrating me because I can't get myself to do anything. why am I so lazy?? I'm literally burnt out from doing nothing all day. I have a gym membership but I never go cause my anxiety is just way too high. 

I do hate my body &amp; I wish I could bring myself to go to the gym, but I don't eat enough. I even hate eating, it feels like a chore and nothing that I enjoy anymore. I hate how I look, especially my body, since I don't really eat much I'm way too thin and almost look sick. I've spent such a long time trying to love myself, at one point I just decided to give up. I feel like I am so ugly &amp; even though people tell me that I'm not, I'm so self conscious of myself. I feel like even how I'm walking is wrong, I hate my posture and my teeth, I hate how I dress &amp; I don't have any money to buy myself nice things. I compare myself to so many beautiful women online &amp; know that I'll never be happy with my looks. 
it doesn't matter how many times I change my hair, change my make up, my personality, I still always end up hating myself. 

I also have a pretty sad home life. both of my parents don't work, growing up we never had any money &amp; sometimes there wasn't even enough money for food. I have 5 siblings, 2 of whom I don't speak to. my parents have a lot of debt, even making debt in my name. as a child I also saw the police at home often, since my father did a lot of illegal things. at home it's always dirty, since my mom never cleans &amp; my siblings don't really care either. I'm the only one who's always cleaning, but I don't get appreciated &amp; I don't want to tidy up anymore. I would do anything to get out of here since I also have to share a room with my 2 sisters, but I don't have enough money. 

I don't have any hobbies, I hate everything and I regret not killing myself when I was 16 and still had the guts to do it. now I'm just slowly rotting away day by day. I wake up nauseous every day due to my anxiety, I've had sleeping problems since forever and I also have migraines almost everyday. I feel like my body will give up on its own slowly. 

I've tried finding my way to god, but I didn't feel better. I even tried manifestation and spirituality but nothing fucking works. I've tried waking up early, sleeping 8 hours or 4 hours is no difference, everyday I wake up tired of life. I want to go outside when I'm inside &amp; I always want to go home when I'm outside. I don't belong anywhere, I don't know who I am. everyday I look into the mirror and don't know who I'm looking at, it's like I'm a stranger to myself. I lost my teenage years to depression &amp; now I'm 20 and will never get those years back. I don't even know why I'm writing this right now, or if anyone will even read through this, but I just feel so alone and like life is a chore. 
maybe I should start therapy, but where I life it's impossible to find a therapist. I just want to life like everyone else, I don't want to be me anymore. I live in a constant state of stress, but I can't even cry anymore, I haven't cried in months even though I'm so miserable. 

I don't want to die, but I feel like I don't belong here. I feel like an outsider &amp; my autism only makes it harder for me to live. when I'll die someday, I hope everyone regrets how they treated me.

Tired of being different,"I can’t take it anymore man the fact that I am so wildly different from everyone else around me in a way that only they can see has been weighing on me particularly hard recently, and it frustrates me to no end that I will never be able to fix it because I am autistic and I just have to accept that. It makes me feel so unlovable, I’m almost incapable of making friends, and my one close relationship is with my abusive boyfriend who I’m too scared to leave because he’s literally the only person who likes me- but even then he doesn’t respect me.

i will be sick forever,"i want to kill myself again. ive been fine for a long time, nothing more or less. I even graduated group therapy a few months ago after 2 years of treatment. I havent self harmed in 2 years, and in most of that time i didnt even think about relapsing. but i dont even fucking know how much time i have left now. been struggling with PTSD since i was 14; sexually assaulted 8 times before i even turned 13. im never going to live a normal life. not a day has gone by since my diagnosis where i havent been completely debilitated by my paranoia and flashbacks. Where i havent felt disgusting, dirty and unable to be clean the burden of mankinds cruelty off my skin. i never got justice. i have to go to school with my abuser. i fought so hard for months and years to get some kind of justice or any kind of closure and it hasnt happened. it wont ever happen. I told counslers, friends, therapists, police officers, security guards, family. Nothing. every day for weeks id be in the nurses office, sick to my stomach because id be forced to see my abusers face in the hallway. It happened too long ago for them to even do anything. middle school, when i was so fucking stupid and niave that i didnt even realize i was being sexually exploited and physically abused and i just let it happen for 2 years because i thought it was normal. i thought it made our friendship stronger. i couldnt even fight back anyway. i just let it happen. and now its too late. ive been angry and sick and tormented for so long. i want to be at peace amd make the fear stop. ive been almost completely alone in this fight since the day it began and i cant help but resent every single living person around me for being able to live normal lives. im so scared. i never got to be a child. I died the first time i was assaulted and ive been dead since then. its all my fault. it couldnt have been more obvious what was happening and i was so stupid. I was a stupid 10 year old little girl. why couldnt i save her? why didnt anybody save me/?? everyone saw it happen and nobody helped.i just let it happen like i had no other purpose in my life other than being groped and hit like a dog. have all my youth stripped from my dying body. even when i felt fine, i never was. my trauma was a wound that never closed, never scabbed, and never scarred; it just bled and bled.   
every time i lay there bleeding on the bathroom floor in the dead of night, i imagined that someone was there to hold my head on a towel in their lap and press rags of warm water into my legs and carry me back to bed. bed where im safe and w arm. i love my best friend and if i cant fight for much longer then i hope you can forgive me.i love my cats, tortilla chip and chloe. i love when you roll on your back and let me pet your fuzzy belly and drool all over me when i pet you. if there comes a day sometime in the near future where i decide to make all the endless buzzing in my head stop, ill be thinking of you too.",Ill_Wait_3954,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2skql/i_will_be_sick_forever/

I feel I should die because I contributed to others pain,"I was violently raped by my former boyfriend, then was told by him it was my fault. I also just didn’t want to believe he’d do that to me…we were planning on marrying and he apologized. The brainwashing he did to me over the course of our abusive relationship was significant. After I was raped I was told by others that he was a serial rapist. I ignored this and continued to date him for a few more weeks. I was obviously judged and shamed for this. I know I was suicidal at the time and couldn’t cope with the truth but I can’t forgive myself for not immediately believing them and providing them support. I did break up with only a few weeks after he raped me but the damage I caused by having a lack of clarity and not wanting to accept reality is a shame I can’t bear.

Suicide prevention?,"After the loss of a family member,  there was a lot of concern about my mental health and my risk for suicide, since I've had suicidal ideologies after leaving the military.

Prior, I spent a better part of a decade to get better and found solace in family, I've never been happier or as content with life less than a month ago.

When that all came crashing down, they tried to hide my guns and asked if I needed to go somewhere for awhile to sort myself out but I couldn't leave what was left of my family to grieve without me.

The guilt and regrets are eating me alive, I lost over 15lbs in 3 weeks, I hardly sleep anymore, the drugs make me have lucid dreams, so I quit them for my sanity, but I also want to dream of her in a better place.

Whatever 'faith' I had is gone, I realize that there isn't any Supreme being or heaven or a metaphysical place we all go to when we die.

I welcome this self destruction of myself, I deserve it, I failed, my life is meaningless in the grand scheme of things, I'm not going to cure cancer, I'm not going to be the  president of the United States, I'm just 1 of several billions and my mark on this world will be inconsequential. 

I did have one thing, one of the best things to ever happen to me is now gone and I can't think of how things can get better, because I had it all everything I ever dreamed of came true, I was happy and content and that's all gone now and there's nothing to gain or achieve anymore. My ambition was set and completed and I don't know if I can start over as there is nothing left to accomplish in my life. Nothing.

They took away my guns temporarily because of my past history but I have them back while my hostility and hatred has returned from the dead I fear my self destruction is imminent and nothing can stop me now. I'm not control anymore, God help those who try me because I don't care about the repercussions of my actions and I can easily justify it in my fucked up head. Might as well kill me now, that's what I want more than anything ",new-object-found,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2xrdw/suicide_prevention/

I have been in pain for a decade ,"Since 11. My first attempt all because my mom was mad at me for losing my iPod. An ipod. They way she acted made me resort to that, so young. 

My mom was an awful mother. Said and did way too many things a parent never should, even sexually assaulting me when I was 12. 

My ex boyfriend was abusive too. He also sexually assaulted me multiple times. Why did I let that happen. I don’t know. Maybe I thought because he still loved me even though h he hurt me, just like my mother. 

Being strong for so long is very tiring. I wish, I wish I was able to do it. But I can’t.

I don't deserve my boyfriend's unconditional love ,"Basically as it suggests\~ I'm a 21 year old (F) who has struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a preteen. This is my first and I hope only boyfriend but I feel my own mental health struggles are causing a rift in our relationship. He has told me he resents me for the times i've gotten irrationally mad at him. I can see where he comes from and when i'm overstimulated or overwhelmed I don't handle it well, plain and simple I can be a bit of a b\*tch. On top of all this, my mood changes so rapidly he feels he has to walk on eggshells sometimes, I get in depressive moods which tell me that I don't deserve love and I don't deserve him. 

Further, I feel sometimes I wish i'd die or be murdered so he could let go of me (of a future with me) because all I want is for him to be happy. Although it would break me, its worth letting him go so he can be happier, more fulfilled, and appreciated in a relationship than he is now with me. I feel he deserves so much more than what I am giving him and I would die just to do that. I have told him on occasion these exact thoughts which has left him emotionally numb. I can tell that he has grown tired of this constant narrative of mine, he often tells me to ""just not"", and I sense I have caused him emotional trauma since he rarely and typically refuses to express his emotions with me anymore. 

I hold so much guilt for the pain I have caused him and I wish he would focus his attention towards someone more worthy of his unconditional love. 

I have gone to years of therapy on and off, I contextualize and intellectualize my emotions so much that I always feel multiple emotions at once in a given situation and fall into depressive patterns such as these whenever a stressor is present (intense uni schedule or narcissistic mom). All I want to do is not feel so many emotions anymore and sometimes I think its better for my boyfriend and myself if I died. 

My heart goes out to those who also feel this way. ",DryIntroduction4800,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2u7do/i_dont_deserve_my_boyfriends_unconditional_love/

Again,"Last week I tried OD'ing, ended up in the ER, lived (obviously xD), It was in the middle of a mental breakdown but the week before I kinda felt it coming, and asked to be put in a mental hospital as I was a danger to myself, they kept me with family for around 2 days, then let me be alone and that happened. 

The trip from the OD ended last tuesday, 2 full days in my memory gone, but whatever I guess, we live n learn to live with it. The last couple of days have been pretty good, again with family, but this time doing more fun stuff, and I genuinely felt really good.

My days tend to be alright, my nights breakdowns, until I fall asleep. I only had breakdowns the last 2 nights, but the suicidal thoughts are back. Again.

"My cousin attempted suicide, what should I do?","My cousin and I grew up together. We've been like siblings and best friends since we were young. I moved away to the United States and she went to a different city for University.
I came back this summer for vacation and we spent a few days together last week before she went back to school.
I could tell she was feeling down. She has lost a lot of weight since I saw her. I noticed she developed an ED and tried my best to make her eat more. 
Yesterday I went on Snapchat and saw her story she made about her healing journey from depression.
Turns out, she's been extremely depressed and self harming. According to her this is not the first attempt but the 32nd.
As I was scrolling through I felt like a failure for not recognising the obvious signs. And at the end of her story she said she relapsed again and goodbye for the last time.
She sent me s snap of her arm attached to an IV (I saw this before her Snapchat story) I called her several times she didn't pick up.
She just replied to me that she's hospitalised for attempt and that she'll call me later.

I have no idea what to say to her to help her. We are separated by cities and I don't think her parents know about it. I'm scared to tell them because it will feel like I'm breaking her trust and sharing something she doesn't want to share.

I understand her a little since I had multiple suicidal thoughts myself but never had the courage to go through with it.

I don’t want to see my therapist on Monday, it’s too embarrassing.

I’m not supposed to die before them, yet I’m staring at this rack of pills, and I haven’t even said goodbye to everyone properly yet. 

It wasn’t anyone’s fault. This wasn’t anyone’s fault. I’m the one falling short. I can’t pull myself out of this, no matter how much I try, I’m stuck in this pathetic state alone. 

The last time I was warded, my dad told me that it would crush him for me to leave him. He was down the entire time but he kept trying to smile at me. 

And after I got discharged he would make a big fuss whenever there was any sort of sharp object or pill bottle around me and hide it when I was around like I was some sort of fucking psycho.

I Wish My Mom Let Me Die.,"I am 30 years old. My mother is a very very wealthy woman ( I didn’t find out until I was 21). But I didn’t grow up that way. I raised thinking we were poor. My mom would let the gas, electricity, etc get caught off. Never got an allowance, and never went on fancy trips. 
I was not spoiled. I had jobs since I was 14, bought my own car. My mom constantly, every day 24 hours a day stated how much she hated having kids and having a house. And how we’re getting evicted the next day. Or we’re going be on the streets next week. Really makes you feel worthless. 

The only piece of advice my mom ever gave me was “major in health science”.  I did just that. I majored in biology and since then 9 years ago…to date over 5000 Job applications. No job. And 10 total interviews. For context I’ve been rejected from:
1300 entry level hospital desk jobs
500+ office assistant jobs 
500+ admin assistant jobs 
Dominoes delivery driver 5x
Post office cashier 10x 
100+ Office mail clerk 
Hospital greeter 20x 
150+ receptionist jobs
250+ bio research jobs 
Enterprise rent a car 15x 
Amazon warehouse worker 20x
I wasn’t the best student but definitely above average and I have a decent resume/work history. Still, I’ve done evey applicable google cert. hubspot cert. Microsoft cert. countless resume/cover letter courses. I’ve emailed almost 300 hiring managers. Zero have ever responded to me. 
I got a 14/hour job at a medical office and that’s where I’ve been the last 4 years. A few years ago I developed a cancerous and painful tumor. I asked my mom if she could help me pay for an MRI. She said we couldn’t afford it. And said “I’ll pray for you”. After 6 months in agony still working. I found a doctor that took my shitty insurance and he said he could keep me comfortable for year or so before the cancer killed me. Since I couldn’t even begin to afford treatment. I came to peace with that. I had a minimum wage job, no savings, I lost the love of my life who waited patiently for years for me to get a decent job, and nothing to show in life. I accepted it  and I was ready to die. 

At the 11th hour my mom swooped in, talked me off the ledge, got me better insurance, and got me cancer free. 6 rounds of chemo and 3 surgeries. I am now cancer free. But at the end, my mom left me with the bills and went straight back to her cold dismissive ways. High five figures that I could never pay back. I am back where I started in a perpetual cycle of rejection but now with staggering medical debt. 

People say go back to school or get this or that certification but I could never afford too then and definitely not now with the medical debt. 

I still drive the same car I had when I was 17 and it’s on its last legs. I tried to join the military but my diagnosis made me “unfit for service”  I don’t know what to do…I don’t have any hope.

But tonight is too much. I’ve worked through pain from childhood, long term relationship ending and my closest family member and best friend passing away. I spoke to my ex tonight, and have realised the love I felt for all those years was never reciprocated in the same way. One person who I thought really saw me for who I was, did, and decided I wasn’t enough. 
That’s not the reason to end things, but it just feels like the last straw.

My only friend is the person my ex cheated on me with and I feel bad for burdening him too. I think he’s only friends with me out of guilt for the situation. I’ve attempted in the past but those who cared for me always stepped in. Now that I’m alone, I feel like I can do it with minimal heartache to anyone else. I know it will hurt my ex and my one friend, but I can’t keep fighting and I think they would understand. I finally have the opportunity to do it without hurting anyone. I recently attempted while on the phone with my friend but he started crying and calling out my name begging me not to and it stopped me. It hurt so badly to hear him hurt because of me but I hurt all the time now and I’m burdening everyone else with my hurt. I won’t tell him I’m doing it this time. He can’t stop what he doesn’t know.

Turns out I might have cancer,"I swear I'm cursed or something. Bad shit keeps happening to me, it's not been a very good few months already and now I've got to deal with this too. 

I've had symptoms of bowel cancer for a while now, but I just assumed it was something else since I'm young so I ignored it. Last week the symptoms got so unbelievably bad that I had to see my doctor. I was hoping for something simple but he ruled out hemorrhoids or a fissure an had me do a FIT test. I maxed out that test, literally as high as it could measure. There's only a couple diseases that can cause that result, and the only one that matches my symptoms is cancer. I'll have an endoscopy soon to confirm though.

Ive almost certainly got cancer, at 23 years old. Ill probably lose all my hair from chemo and look like a man. They might have to cut out parts of my bowels. I might need a permanent colostomy bag. Maybe it's spread to other parts of my body and I'm basically dead already.

I am so fucking scared. I just want to give up, I don't want to go through all that pain. I've tried to kill myself over less, and I'm finding right now that it's a very attractive option.",Impossible-Basket284,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2s4cb/turns_out_i_might_have_cancer/
For the Record.,"I'm going to kill myself and I'd like to post my suicide note here; I have it in writing but I'd like to have it somewhere where it is widely available to read. I'm really sorry and I wish things could be different. I really do.

To Whom It May Concern,

I'd like to start off by saying that what I end up doing was nobody's fault; this was the a decision that was the result of a lot of different factors. I will sum things up by saying that my life was not one that anyone would ever want to live. Sure, bad things happen to everyone--but I am inadequate. In every facet of existence I fall short of the mark. I have no talents, I am alone even when I'm around others, I have no drive to attempt things because I know that I will fail. I used to love writing (it is what is driving me to write this) but I have come to realize that this thing I loved was merely just a way to avoid the loneliness of my reality--the sadness that nothing will get better; I was just as bad at it as everything else unfortunately. I was not made for life. It is a strange statement, but one I know to be true. If I were anyone else I'd be happy and not writing this. Some people are given bad lives, but those people can overcome them and go on to have wonderful lives. I am not one of these people; once I drew that short straw my fate was sealed. Some people are just not meant to be born.

For awhile I thought things were getting better; in 2019 I had a job that I loved, friends that I cared for and that I believe cared for me, and a family situation that was pleasant enough. Right around this time, when things were looking up, the pandemic hit and things became the worst they'd ever been. My job (one in the medical field) fell into chaos and deteriorated my mental state further; eventually we were bought out and I had to quit. My mother also went missing around this time while camping and they have still not found a trace of her. In the aftermath of the pandemic my friends drew away from me and now it is as if I do not exist to them. I wanted to go to school, but this too the pandemic prevented. If this had not happened I think things could have been bearable for a little while longer.

Every day that I lived was a trail and I was always overcome with a sense of loneliness and despair. I felt that life was a prison and I didn't know how to escape or why I was even in this prison. Some people may ask what my problems were or offered advice, but this could never help in anyway because they could not understand what I feel every day--they did not have to endure the pain that life caused me. It was never about the problems--not at its core; these only served to heighten this pain. The only time I ever felt free was when I was sleeping, only there was I free of the pain, in my dreams. Dreams of a better existence, surrounded by people that wanted me around, of experiences I could never have in the waking world. My sleep was a reality of love, of warmth and belonging, and it is my hope that I'll return there in a more permanent capacity. That was the only place that my hopes were made manifest. You may not understand anything I'm saying, nothing I'm describing, and if that's the case then it is good news! Because you are not feeling what I am feeling and I am very glad for that.

I'm sure I sound crazy, but no therapist could have helped, even if I could have afforded it (which I could not). I understand the function of SSRIs and of the chemical imbalance that occurs in those with depression. I do not have depression, these medications would not have worked; what I had was a terminal outlook on life and a ceaseless soul-crushing anguish. There are people like me who cannot be helped, no matter how hard you try: it is an effort in futility. Please know that no amount of help could have changed my decision, and please do not blame yourselves for this, because it was well out of your control.

I could ask for your forgiveness, but a complete waste like me does not deserve it. I understand if you hate me, that is something I do deserve. I've tried to better myself, I've tried to help others, but nothing I do truly matters. I'm just so tired of everything. I know that I'm leaving a lot of stuff behind, just do with it as you please, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience that this causes you. For that, I am a horrible person.

Reasons to live,"First I want to say I came from r/therapy the auto mod said to come here so here I am
Here's my original message:

I don't really feel like explaining my whole life story right now, just know it's really only getting worse.  To put it simply, I've lost basically all my friends.  I've lost my dog and my girlfriend.  My parents seem so unhappy with their lives as adults, and I really just don't enjoy life anymore.

On top of that, the world is a crazy shitshow and I really don't understand what the point in living is.  What great reason is there to go on?  For love?  I highly doubt with my mentally unstable self, I will ever find someone who loves me unconditionally.  For money? Yeah I ain't gonna be wealthy either, my parents are having a hard enough time just paying rent let alone groceries and helping me with school or trying to get me diagnosed and forget paying for any medication.  For fun? Nothings fun about this world.  Terrible people continue to run free from any guilt and any problems.  I've seen so many bad people get away with things and see no repercussions, and I try my best to be loyal and respectful to everyone (admittedly I fail for sure) but I try to be nice and I get the short end of the stick for trying to be a decent person.  

I'm convinced there's no good reason I should stay in this world, what logical sensical reasoning is there for enduring any more years of this?  I've lost so much and I don't want to throw myself a pity party, but everything's terrible.  My life has nothing going for it, no bright future, I'm not smart, I have a screwed up brain, living in a world where nobody cares about me, there's seriously no reason to keep going.

I don't know why I keep going, I guess part of me still has hope but I really think it would be better if I was dead.  The only ""enjoyment"" I get out of life is playing video games and half the time I don't even like playing games they're only a coping mechanism.  I always feel lonely no matter what anyone says.  I don't think I've loved anything or anyone since my dog passed.

I just think that i'm a waste of space, my parents waste money and reputation for me to fuck everything up, i don't have many real friends and i'm going nowhere with my career... i'm 23 and getting older and still haven't finished university.

I wasted so many opportunities for not caring about my future, for being scared that i'll fail, i just waited until i didn't had any chances left and now i'm here. I really don't think there's anything left for me, i don't think i'll kill myself bcs i'm to coward for that, but i sure do think i deserve it.

I hate myself,"I feel very lonely, with no real activities apart from work. My debts consume most of my money. A year ago, the stress, depression, and frustration from not finding a job in my field despite having a degree, combined with the three-year struggle to get off a toxic job, the death tought who came back, and Hearing people complain about having a good life was difficult. I finally left a toxic job for a non-toxic that didn’t suit me. All of this piled up, and I cut off all contact. After three months, I received a few greetings and nothing more (six months later, one of them tried multiple times, but I didn't feel ready With my miserable life, I didn't want to reconnect until I had changed). I told myself that getting only two greetings in all that time showed I wasn't part of the group. most time ignored, I was more like a third wheel in a group of eight people for ten years (that's how I feel it).

Later, in November, a friend from another city came to mine and tried to get back on my feet. I engaged in activities, went out, tried dating apps, and had one date (I was super happy because, at my age (M27), it was my first date, despite many opportunities before). But the date was one-sided; she said yes but without enthusiasm, and I clung to it, seeking some love, though it was pointless. This improvement was short-lived. In January, I tried to enjoy my passion for photography, forced myself to improve, and reconnected with former colleagues and friends, though one had manipulative tendencies. I saw him as a male figure, in quotes. However, every time I posted a photo, he would call me on every platform possible (at least five calls), send messages everywhere, and leave comments. It was always to ask what was happening (related to the post). As an introvert, I didn’t like it; it made me feel watched 24/7. Another mistake I made was letting someone use my identity to find a job, adding stress at the end of each month because I didn't realize it would be automatically declared. So, I decided to cut connections, and since then, nothing. But my identity is still being used. A few days ago, I asked him via message to stop using it. He replied by sending an image and then deleting it before I could see it. I still have some hope because I changed my ID a few months ago, and the one he uses expires at the end of this month.

I already know that next year I'll owe taxes as if I were rich ( I prefer he stops using my ID and I pay the taxes than say it because if I do that I can lose everything, and I would probably need to fly away that country and never come back) while earning minimum wage with 28% of my salary going to debts each month. The government believes I earned double my actual salary because 2 minimum wages = rich enough. I have no contact with anyone; I feel alone. I have small projects and passions, but I can't motivate myself to pursue them. I wish I could succeed in motivating myself, stop putting myself in danger due to my altruism, make good friends and find a girlfriend in my city, and stop having failures like the rest of my life. I wanted to see a psychiatrist; I had one session but couldn't afford more. It put me in the red, and my employer's insurance is so poor that it doesn't cover what's usually reimbursed in my country, Im waiting for my refund so I can see my psychiatrist.

Every time I'm sad or angry, I remember all the times my mother told me I was useless, that I would never achieve anything, and that she hoped I would fail in life. All the time I stayed home because going out meant spending money for her. All the times I refused to go out with friends because I would be harassed on my phone ten minutes later, being told it was time to come home. Every time one of her acquaintances died, it was my fault. She even told me twice that I was worse than an accident worse than an unwanted, the worst thing that ever happened to her, and that she wished I had never existed. I knew I wasn't wanted but it was hard to hear that as a child, she bought me girls' stuff even though I am a boy. Ironically, she doesn’t like homosexuals! At one point, I believed I was a girl born in a boy's body(10\~\~14y). Around 15y, I started playing online games and met the group I cut off contact with last year. I desperately searched for a way to be loved, a way to forget, like adults drowning their sorrows in alcohol, but for me, it was in games.

I remember around 10 or 11, I wanted to end it. A friend at the time saw me and stopped me. Sometimes I think she shouldn't have intervened.

At 18, I left the country. After that, my mother would tell me she loved me and all, but she always had to remind me in every call that it was my fault for this, my fault for that. She also mentioned who would take care of her once she is too old (actually she is 66y) I suppose it will be my older brother (M38). My mother always called me by my brother’s name. I know she rarely called my brother by my name, but for me, it was all the time. My brother and I didn’t live together much; he lived with his father, and his life has also been pretty bad, but at least he is stronger than I am. And anyway, our last text was fine and you, fine thanks (mom and I).

My adult life has been socially challenging. I’ve made some good friends (they live abroad), but I know it has directly impacted my adult life.

In 2021, I hit a shallow point and played with a knife, wanting to stab myself but couldn't do it. I promised myself that if I couldn't improve my life by 30, I would end it all. I don't see the point of living if it’s only to continue being rejected everywhere, never succeeding in anything, and being alone.

i am so exhausted ,"I am 21 and already diagnosed with bpd, bp2, and awaiting a DID diagnosis. I am so exhausted. I constantly live in the past and relive through my trauma every single day to the point that i can no longer take care of myself. i've been depressed for years and started self harming a decade ago, at 11 years old. i've been waiting for it to get better but it just seems to get worse. i've tried every single medication from SSRIS to mood stabilizers to antipsychotics to benzos to self medication with psychedelics and weed. The only thing that helped with the suicidal thoughts was the psychedelics for a few years but they turned into a dependency and i would not like to try them again. I've been in and out of therapy since i was 8. I am so suicidal and tired and feel so trapped that i do not care that anyone will miss me so please don't tell me to stay here for selfish reasons, they will eventually be fine. My boyfriend today said it would kill him and my family but my dad died a few years ago and life goes on whether you like it or not and it gets better dealing with grief. I just can't seem to continue with my life anymore. I can't hold down a job and if i do i can't work for more than 3 days a week and i'm supposed to be going back to college this semester, i can't even take basic care of myself like remember to eat or drink water and my hair is matted because i don't have the energy to brush it.

DEATH,"The Hatred that is the Devil's love is the only love that's true,
(For) Where were you, O divine love, when everything cried for you?

My paths have gazed at your Minotaur like murderers with unpunished guilt,
(But)When was this life of mine, in this labyrinth, ever in need for you?

My sobriety left the day Spring arrived for you with its precious gifts, 
When was this Human Seed ever in need for you?

I implored you, my mother, but the Mountain gazed, gazed, and coerced you, 
When were you ever important when my Mind cried for you?

Death makes for me a Heaven of nothingness that I so adore,

Silently waiting ,"It’s been a long road for me, but I feel like the end is near. At the age of 17, I tried to off myself with an IED style grenade (aerosol can on a fire). It backfired on me, quite literally. It left me with burns on my face and neck, and mental scars that will never go away. It haunts me every night, even to this day.

Your reactions are valid or actions rather you're not the best piece of society might be dreamed of but you're perfect fit for someone else for yourself. 

I can't deny that life has sorted me out in a fucked up way, or maybe I'm too nueurodivergent to understand that I'm not special like my parents describe me to be. We're not fit into space where we are judged for being who we are. We wanted to be normal but we can't help it. We were just not wired for things that's considered and deemed as normal. 

We're weird crazy and so much other things that people describe us but who are we really? I come to the conclusion we don't knew ourselves we are so lost. We were just a kid who have the hope and cling to the promises that we might change the world someday. 

Please don't be like me, Dont be a frustrated daydreamer and a procrastinator. I've done enough self sabotage that I can't bounce back. Someone might say you can do it, I did it myself too. They're not on your shoes they never knew how much you suffer enough to be accepted for who you're or how much you suffer to be deemed as normal.

""I woke up In the morning and I didn't want anything, didn't do anything, couldn't do It anyway, just lay there listening to the blood rush through me and It never made any sense, anything.""

the sound of my breath, the feeling of my pulse, it's nauseating, all of it.

it's gnawing to exist.

i told my sister i was going to kill myself tonight, but she never responded. so i just deleted the messages to save myself the embarrassment.

i really am the scum of life, not even my own family wants to help me.

i'm so pathetic, i can't take living anymore.

i just want to feel okay again.

i want to listen to nirvana all day and sleep like a baby again. but lying down makes my ribs scrape against the insides my skin, piercing, and it's uncomfortable. 

so i haven't slept that much over these past days.

i feel so lightheaded all of the time, i just want it to stop already. 

i want to feel good, i want to go to school next month and be okay again. 

but i feel as if it's too late for me now.

14 years, yet It feels as If I have been alive for all eternity, excruciatingly.

it's harrowing to have to breathe to survive, to keep my blood pumping through my body, through the tips of my fingers.

i can't handle being this person anymore.

to live the life of a human being anymore.

no one, floating aimlessly through life without purpose or reason.

i'll extend my hand, but no one will take it,

to intertwine their fingers with mine, 

to tell me it'll all be okay again.

no one will bother to help me, no one no one no one.

am i really such a burden?

why must i be so hard to love, why was i born in the first place? nothing.

oh, what a shame it is to be me. i'll cry out against my existence, but i'll still be here. 

nothing, excruciating.

""I shall be nothing, the wind, the sky.""

the texture, the taste, the smell, no motivation, no incentive to do anything anymore.

as i am writing this, i feel so lightheaded, and it's unbearable to even breathe. 

such a strange feeling, to exist.

oppressing, harrowing, incomprehensible.

i feel my heart beat from the inside of my throat, and i feel sickened when i press my fingers against it, to feel it pulsate beneath.

i look into the mirror, and all that looks back is a person who has lost everything.

i miss having the luxury to enjoy life.

it's too late though. i feel too far gone. 

i can't find a reason to be much longer; no desire or hope to live, nothing but the blankness of death after.

""There's nothing worth pursuing at the cost of prolonging a life of suffering.""

i'm so scared of the pain though, that i'm starting to second-guess myself.

i hope it'll snap my neck. i don't want to have to die a slow and suffocating death.

that's what i fear the most, the pain that'll follow death.

why is it so hard to just die painlessly and instantly? 

what a pathetic life i have made for myself,

what a pathetic excuse of a human being.

i truly am nothing to this world.

 it's unbearable to think anymore, to feel anything at all anymore. 

excruciating, nothing.

i just want to fade out of existence so i won't have to think about anything anymore. 

Thinking Is exhausting, and I just want to rest already.

"I was an abuser, I can't live with myself","I was 17, a kid came up to me and grabbed my chest. I pushed the kid away. I told them not to do it again. I should've done more, should've done better. The kid came a while later, and did it again. I asked them what they were doing and why and told them to stop. I pushed them again.

At this point another kid entered the park, saw this exchange, and went ""oh wow let me do it too"" and then they both ran around and chased me, begging to touch me nonstop. I was overwhelmed and just let the first kid do it. I unfocused my eyes and dissociated as hard as I could. I don't understand, I was the teen, I was the older one, I should've put a complete end to it. I'm a monster.

I stopped the kid after a minute with a hard no, and finally left the park. It took two years, after my dad's abuse finally stopped and I finally had independence and the space to mentally mature, for me to come to the realization of what I'd done. And ever since then I've been wracked with horrible guilt that I totally and completely deserve. I deserve to die.

Life is hard,"I started having suicidal thoughts by the time I was 6. When I was 7 my mom found my diary in which i stated how badly I wanted to die. She didn't put me in therapy or anything though. When I was 14 the principal was made aware I wanted to kill myself and had attempted before but he never did anything about it. My parents are drug addicts. Hard stuff. Coke and crack mostly. I live in fear of people I know succumbing to addiction. I can't handle the thought of anyone I care about doing so much as smoking weed. I have no friends. The friends I do have are terrible, they don't treat me very well. The only good person in my life is my boyfriend. He's the one who pushed me to seek medications for my issues. They do help. They help a lot actually. But I still have moments. My cat has bloodwork Tuesday. There's a high possibility of a diagnosis that will kill him sooner or later. He's my baby. He was my only friend during middle school. He was my best buddy during covid. He's my baby. I can't bear to lose him. I lost my other cat 3 years ago and I swore when my current cat died I'd kill myself. Now he's sick and I don't know how I can carry on without him. I know my boyfriend would be devastated but he's really outgoing and I think he'd been fine. I just can't stand the idea of losing my baby. He's not my cat, he's my baby. I can't lose my baby.

And I want to kill myself so I don't have to think about anything anymore. I've been suicidal for years since I was 14 now I'm 18, but it was always for different reasons, I got through those but this one feels so hard. I can't live around any of my family anymore or I will lose my mind. My mom is also suicidal and might kill herself if I leave or even tell her that I want to. Of not she might do something else or live the rest of her life depressed. I know it's fucked but I think if I just doe at least I won't have to think about it even though she'll still be depressed. The rest of my family will hate me as well because in their religion I can't leave home till I get married and they consider someone leaving the religion the worst thing anyone can do and would kill me if it was legal. (Or at least they agree with that) because of this as well every time I try to change and do something, I fail so quickly and I need to be by myself so I can breathe. Every time I ask someone people tell me ""it's not your responsibility"" or ""call the police or a therapist for your mom"" but it's so hard to. I don't know what the fuck to do. My step-dad also got his boss to offer me a job at his company. It's minimum wage but it is good experience for a career so my mum tells me I have to agree. I don't want that at all. I'd rather work a shitty job while working on what I want at the same time and live alone. But I can't work in the same company with my step-dad and leave. I'm planning to leave as soon as the summer ends since I'll turn 18. How am I gonna do this. What's the best way to go about this. Like what do I specifically say. Just so you know my mom's made it known I can't leave because of the religion so I have to tell her I don't believe anymore.

I was 15-16 years at that time old and she was 14-15, it was a long distance relationship (we met maybe twice in real life?), The first time she said she would teach me how to kiss, which she did, during the same meeting she took my hands and put them on her body. The second time we met we could have irl contact every day, everything was great, like we were happy to be together. She showed me the city etc, our parents met. On the Before the last day of my ""trip"" we were alone, at one point we were hugging, at one point i kiss her and she said ""nono"" and kissed her again, I can say that I did something wrong and I regret it. Later she took off my pants and started sucking my dick without my consent, I later asked if I could touch her and she said yes. The next day he was normal. Later she wrote to me ""it's pity we didn't have sex"". Our relationship was okay, There wasn't much change in anything until finally one day she Wrote me a message about a break, I didn't take it very well, After some time her friend texts me whom do they hate? At least from what I saw and heard (once we played a game with him or wrote on groupchat), He said that I had molested her, I wrote to her immediately and she neither confirmed nor denied it, Then I had a nervous breakdown, I agreed to everything her friend wrote, All I could write was ""I'm sorry"". And that's how it all ended, After a while I didn't see my mistake i make, I told close friends and they didn't see my fault either I don't know if it's because they know me or something.

My grandfather is currently on his death bed. He is my second father, as he played a big role as a parental figure growing up. My boyfriend of almost a year just broke up with me because he claimed I didn’t care enough, which is so far from the truth. I’ve always felt as if I was supposed to die young. I’ve died from countless drug overdoses. Although I am recently sober, I feel as though I am a huge burden on my family and friends. I want out. My car broke down and my best friend is in a drug-induced psychosis as we had a “friend” who gave him cocaine which caused a really bad reaction. He is not all there currently. We’re about to lose our apartment, we might have to give our cats away. My car’s transmission also went out and I’m $2,000+ in the hole with this car. No one can help me financially and I don’t see a point to anything anymore. I have become more and more comfortable over the idea of death. Thinking about it brings me peace.

I have no talents at all, im lowkey ugly, barely have any friends in my life (the ones that i have rn i cant even call them ‘friends’). Im an introvert as well. Nothing as ever went the right way in my life. 

Im so fucking burnt out which leads to my grades being shit. I argue with my mother at least 6/5 times a week, i can never tell her whats going on because that’s just going to start another argument.

Im so miserable. I wish i was those ppl that has a good relationship with their parents, who is good looking, has friends that they can actually call ‘friends’ , who has amazing grades and countless talents. 

Everything has been going wrong in my life. I can’t remember when was the last good thing that happened to me lmao. Ive attempted to delete my existence last year before and it didnt work. And because of that my relationship with my family members are ruined even more, they literally hate me for it now. I remember when i was hospitalised all they cared about the most was the hospital fees. I even  heard them gossiping about me lol.

I cant take it anymore. I often go to this tall building and just stare down, wanting to jump. But I’m scared. Not that I’m scared of death, its just that, what if i survive the fall and become paralysed? What if my dead body will traumatise a passed-by? The main thing im scared of is that the attempt doesn’t work. I don’t wanna survive and be paralysed and be even MORE miserable.

Im seriously so tired. Why did my mother even give birth to me? Every once in a while she’ll say how without me her life would be so much better, like, you had a chance to abort me.

I needed some time alone but after asking for reassurance and if he still loves me he isn’t responding to me or checking up on me anymore (which I am not mad at him for. I understand).

Suicidal because of ADHD ,"It’s all so tiresome. I drag myself through each day, but for what? I have no idea, and honestly I don’t care to find out. I have no reason to stay here. I feel alone, misunderstood, but most importantly tired. I’m tired of burdening others with my incompetence. Everyone hates me and I can’t blame them, I hate me too. I’m tired of feeling uncomfortable from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep. I’m constantly either overstimulated or understimulated. I’m tired of overreacting to the smallest of things. I’m too sensitive for this world. The tiniest inkling of rejection will send me spiraling for hours. Why can’t I be like everyone else? Everyday blends into the next. I can’t remember the last time I was genuinely excited about something. I’m about ready to call it quits at this point. It hasn’t gotten better. I’ve tried therapy. I’ve tried meds. My brain is so disconnected from my body I don’t even feel like a human being anymore. I don’t wanna die but I can’t imagine a future in this world where I’m satisfied in life.

I’ve lost my strength. I’m going to go soon. I’m sorry.,"I’ve been putting up a façade for far too long now. I’ve told my friends that I’m fine for so long. They don’t know anything. I didn’t want to bother them with my true emotions— they have other things to deal with. I don’t want to make them upset by telling them the truth. I’ll just ruin their days.

It’s been too long. I’ve been the one to shoulder so much over the past few years, and I’ve had to keep my head up this entire time. I can’t do that anymore. I don’t feel safe in my own home, nor my own body anymore. I don’t see anything past this year. I haven’t seen anything in my future for a while. All I see is monotony and a fight I cannot win, nor escape from.

I’m not strong enough for this world anymore.

I’m going to start hurting myself again. I need a taste of what I’m getting into. I’ll do a few things I’ve wanted to do for a while — just so I can experience them once before I go. I want to kiss my girlfriend one last time. I want to love my pets before I disappear. I want to tell everyone that I’m sorry. That I love them.

When I finally leave, I’ll go knowing that I did everything I could to stay strong — but I’ll also know that it will be time for me to finally be weak. I will take a bottle and fade away. The pain — the anxiety — will finally stop. I won’t have to worry anymore.

So there was this guy i was with and ive explained this experience to ppl and they say its rape but it doesnt feel like i think it should feel and i still love him, we broke up a few weeks ago. I remember i was excited as we finally were having a good convo while walking to a little private spot we had, i was talking abt my brother when we finally sat down and he pinned me down and started kissing me, which led to sex, i stopped saying it was rude but he js laughed and continued, i didnt say no or push him off i js let it happen, ig it was part of the gf/bf deal but idk if it was wrong. He would ignore me for days and then want nudes. He got upset with me when i asked to use a condom. So i js agreed with not using one and let him have sex with me in a school bathroom. He insisted i didnt have trust in him bc i wanted to use one. But the problem is i still miss him and kinda miss the sexual part of it too.

My childhood was a nightmare and I thought after growing up, that I would finally find some joy in life, but I’ve learned that just never comes for some people. I have nothing and no one to live for. I wish I could say I was being dramatic, but it’s true. I just got fired from the 16th job I’ve had in the last 5 years, which just like the others, I was only able to hold onto for a few weeks. I’ve spent most of the the last few years unemployed and in poverty and I’ve done so much damage to my credit and rental history, that I can’t get approved for anything but the worst apartments in the city and I’ll likely never own a car. Aside from my endless financial problems, I’m also completely and utterly alone in this world. I’ve never really had any friends and spend almost all of my time alone. Last year I lost both my parents and I have no other family. Every year life just gets worse and worse for me. I’m 33 years old and I feel like I’ve never actually been happy. I have nothing to live for and never really have. The only reason I’m even alive now is because I’m afraid of botching the attempt, surviving, and being stuck even worse of than before.

Dementia at 15 ,I’m scared of having dementia at 15 specifically frontotemporal. I recently got diagnosed with GAD/ health anxiety and it’s been driving me insane. I have weird symptoms such as derealization and random pains such as in the leg and stuff. These symptoms lead to me googling them and then I get a panic attack for which disease I have and then the cycle repeats over and over. I’ve went from obsessing of having a heart attack to stroke and now dementia. Recently I have been having memory/ concentration issues and I’ve searched up the symptoms and it told me I might have frontotemporal dementia and it’s honestly scaring me. My mind feels like a prison and feels like it can’t escape this hell of having cognitive issues. These memory problems honestly scare me because sometimes I can’t even remember what is going on in shows or what even happens in a video game I was playing and this leads to me to have a panic attack and then experience derealization and makes me think no one is real and wonder if my family is real. Any day I feel like something bad is going to happen to me and I feel like I can’t do nothing about it because I’m scared to go to the doctors because it scares me if they tell me I have some sort of serious illness and I feel trapped and don’t know what to do.

I read the rules so I apologize if I get anything wrong. I think this is too much for the venting subreddit so I came here. My emotions are everywhere and I’m still crying so I’m sorry if this doesn’t make a lot of sense.


My dad got a new chair, and yknow cool. I put a towel on it because I was wet from playing outside with water and didn’t want the chair to get wet. My dad got so horrifically upset at me over a wet chair. He was screaming at me, and went on and on of oh i got you dinner but no im such a horrible person when I was getting upset and telling him to stop yelling. Even forcing me to get him tea, I said I didn’t want to but I had no choice, he started screaming at me to get him tea. So I did but didn’t put ice so it wasn’t good enough for him and he continued to get mad. I’m already starting to forget a lot, I think my brain is trying to protect me. But basically a lot of blaming, him trying to victimize himself and so much screaming….even getting mad at me for crying and telling me to stop crying.

The point of why I came here at all, I don’t want to talk your ear off with my problems. And maybe im overreacting. Ive been suicidal in the past, 1 almost successful attempt almost 7 years ago, maybe closer to 6 I don’t fully remember. My life has been ruined by my father, I deal with PTSD and a dissociative disorder (dont want to name) because of him. And i guess my feelings are so overwhelming right now. It makes me wish I could just die yknow? Just be away from him and his scary anger. Hell just now while writing this he came up to me and got mad at more things…cant catch a fucking break. But I guess just. I love my mama, i dont wanna leave her behind. She’s seen me almost die before and it broke her, I can’t imagine breaking her heart and even imagining it kills me inside. It’s hard it’s just so hard to be alive. It’s hard to not just do something to myself right now. I guess I just need somewhere to get this out, I feel like I have nobody and I’ve heard bad things about that 988 number and I’m scared of cops showing up at my house.

"If I can’t do anything about my size, then there’s literally no point in living","I’m not even small, just average, like 6” x 4.7”. But if you’re not big, you’re small. And my real problem is girth, which is what matters apparently. No matter who I date, at some point, she will have been fucked by some big dick alpha male type guy. No matter what kind of sex I have, it will never be as enjoyable for me as it is for someone with a big dick. I would do literally anything to have a big dick. Literally anything. I’m completely uninterested in sex. I used to have so much ambition, now I have none. If I can’t compete with dick size, why try to compete in any other way? No matter what I do, the hung guys won. They fucked my girl. They got to feel like more of a man than me. She probably praised them for their size. I would literally kill to have one girl tell me “wow you’re so big” and actually mean it. The fact that any girl I date has given a hung guy that ultimate honor, that ultimate joy and respect that I will NEVER get. If she’s given that to another man, or god forbid, multiple men, then what the FUCK is the point in dating? What kind of respect or admiration can she give me that even comes CLOSE to that? It’s beyond unfair. My life has no meaning, only intense emasculation, pain, and pure rage. There is no point. All my life this has crushed me. I hate women. I hate hung men. If I hear that someone has a big dick, I literally go out of my way to make their life harder. I feel pure joy when I hear that something horrible is happening in their life. Sex is pointless for me because of all of this. Life is entirely pointless. Any romantic love I’ve ever had has involved literally constant rage and agony. This is not hyperbole. Therapy doesn’t help because it doesn’t make my dick bigger. Meds don’t help because they don’t make my dick bigger. Nothing helps. Nothing. Any girl I love is not mine, because she gave some guy the greatest joy and admiration possible. I’m just another lesser man. And no one has any sympathy. No one understands. This has run my life from a very early age. If there is a god, I would do anything just to spit in his face. What kind of god would put pure, ultimate pain and humiliation between someone and love. Every hour of every day, I feel like I’m watching my girlfriend get fucked in front of me. I feel like I’m being completely dominated every second of every day. The thing I love most in the world is constantly being ripped away from me in the most disrespectful way possible. I am constantly feeling the deepest betrayal possible. There is no love left in me. No accomplishment in my life has ever come near to even a tenth of this fucking agony. I have absolutely lost all meaning in life. There is no point. I pray every night that I will die in my sleep. If nuclear war broke out, I would cry happy tears and kiss the ground. There is no deeper humiliation and disrespect. I have no dignity left. I stay alive only because of fear of hell. This pain is greater than my love for my parents even, so they’re not even the thing stopping me anymore. Nothing compares. Nothing redeems life to me. It hasn’t gotten any easier over the years. My life’s purpose now is to make others’ lives worse. No one understands? No one wants to make any efforts to ultimately fix this? Fine. The rest of my hellhole torture life is dedicated to making people suffer for taking my love, joy, innocence, and dignity away so fucking disrespectfully.

Before the “size doesn’t matter” comments start showing up, it fucking matters and it fucking matters to me. Don’t fucking lie. If you dig deep enough, women say it matters. “Your size is fine.” FINE?????? FINE??????? OH GREAT, I LOVE BEING FUCKING “FINE”. “FINE” IS FUCKING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING COMPARED TO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH SO FUCKING BIGGGGGGGGGGGG OH YOU’RE SUCH A MANNNNNNNN EVEN THOUGH YOU HAVEN’T DONE FUCKING ANYTHING TK EARN IT. WHY DO WOMEN TORTURE AND RAPE US LIKE THIS???????? WHY DOES GOD RAPE US LIKE THIS??????? I CAN’T DO IT. I CAN’T DO IT. I FUCKING HATE WOMEN. I HATE WELL-HUNG MEN. I HOPE YOU ALL FUCKING DIE SLOWLY. I AM SO GODDAMN CLOSE. SO FUCKING CLOSE. THERE’S NO FUCKING ESCAPE. NO ONE CARES NO ONE NO ONE NO ONE NO ONE NO ONE NO ONE NO ONE. I’ve hit this with logic from every angle and nothing works. Life is just horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible. At this point, drugs seem like the only option outside of suicide.

If there’s a god he has to answer for this. Evil cocksucking subhuman sadistic dogfucking scumfuck devil of a god and women and well-hung men love his work. You’re all evil.

God fucking damn it someone just fucking fix this. I don’t deserve this, no one deserves this. I used to be a good person and this destroyed me.

I feel like I have no purpose. I don't want to live anymore.,"I've always been seen as the weird person. I'm autistic, have ADHD, anxiety, and chronic depression. I have been constantly suicidal since I was 11. I've also been selfharming since then. 

I am 20 now, just got out of a 2 year long abusive relationship that has completely wrecked all my self confidence. I tried dating, and I keep getting ghosted. I went on 2 dates with a guy who I really liked, but he ghosted me after the second date. 

The only purpose I feel I have is to love other people, but I can't even do that right. I work retail and have no life ambitions other than to be happy with a family and a partner I love. I've wanted to do many things but things are constantly going wrong and I keep failing. 

I have alot of health issues, including chronic pain, so I can't do things. I'm always exhausted, I can never sleep, even with sleep medicine. 

I just feel as if I am a worthless person. All I do is hurt the people around me. I have been doing it my whole life. I was the problem child, I had to go to atleast 10 different schools because I kept getting kicked out. I was hospitalized 5 times between the ages 12 to 16 for attempting suicide and self harm. Since I was 6 I've ve been on about 25 different medications to help me but none of them help much. Ive been in therapy since I was 4, but nothing has helped me. I get burnt out so easily, I don't think I'd be able to hold a full time job. I don't even feel connected to my body, I feel like im wearing a costume and playing the character of myself. 

I just don't see the point. I haven't seen the point for years. The only time I felt I had a purpose was when I was in a relationship. But that wasn't even healthy. He was abusive, yet I still felt like I meant something to someone. But now I don't matter. All I do is weigh my friends down. I just don't want to be here anymore.

I really feel as if I'm not meant to exist. I was made in a lab because my mom couldn't have kids. I'm a twin. My parents only wanted one kid. They have my sister, shes perfect. She graduated as one of the top of her class. She's traveled the world and had alot of life experience. But im just here.

I hate myself and everything,"Hi Ig you can call me Char

I’m 15(NB but AFAB) and I hate everything about myself and my life and living in general

Like with how everything is going in the world and everything it’s not like we’ll live to better the world with the way things are going so it’ll be worth it just ending it all now and it’s not like anyone would really miss me cause my younger sistsers stay with their (abusive) dad and my older brother and sister (irish twins) are in their 30s so I don’t see them as is; my father and mother are both right and my middle sister says to come to her if I feel this way but she’s right too so she wouldn’t get it (and she’ll just tell and probably send me away like they all would)

Idk I think I’ve decided since I’ve been contemplating ending it but I think if Trump becomes pres I’ll actually do it

He doesn’t want people like me alive anyways and our rights will just be abolished cause he doesn’t care and I know this’ll probably be taken down cause politics or whatever but it just feels better to write this down somewhere even though no one cares

I haven’t figured out how to do it yet but I’ve heard you can use ibuprofen and I have my own thing of NyQuil and alcohol I have access to so I hope it will get me to sleep and just let me. Stay asleep so I don’t really feel it yknow

I also have my ocd meds but I can’t take pills so I don’t think the liquid would be as effective

I feel bad for thinking and preparing to do this but it will help in the long run since they don’t have a lot of money so they won’t have to pay for me anymore and my younger sisters will get my room and I have 3,000 in the bank they’ve been saving since I was born so they could use that for bills and stuff so really my death would benefit all of them since they say the economy sucks rn

Idk what put me over the edge we were all abused by my stepdad and my stepmother wishes my father would’ve hit me as a kid so I could not be “far left” and everyone just overall hates me and everything hurts all the time and I feel bad all the time but I can’t handle this anymore

At least no one thinks I’m doing bad (my sister even said I’m like todoroki from this one anime cause she’s never heard me ever vent or talk about my emotions lol)

And idk about the president thing I just feel it’s kinda symbolic in a way. All of my family voting for me to die. And they don’t even know it (though I’m not sure if they did they would choose something else anyways)

Regardless, I'm at the lowest point of my life, and I have a plan I'm going to carry out if things continue as they have.

i don’t think i can do this anymore ,"my life has been horrible. in my childhood i always felt rejection from my peers and the adults in my life. my parents were emotionally neglectful and never gave me validation so i looked to my peers to get it and i couldn’t get it from them either. having adhd made it worse. my true self never seemed to fit in, my un-masked self always seemed to be unacceptable, and even when i changed myself to fit in, i was miserable and still felt rejected. my family is a mess. my dad is always working and is never home. after work he goes to the bar to hang out with friends and drink and doesn’t come home until almost midnight. i’m also afraid he’s an alcoholic. he is never there for me, my siblings, or mom. my poor mom is dependent on him and i’m sure is mildly depressed. everyone ignores the problems in our family and no one wants to change for the better. there’s nothing i can do. but my poor mom and nana.. if i died they’d be devastated. i’d hurt them so badly. i don’t want to hurt anyone but i feel so stuck and miserable and like ill never amount to anything. i hate how i look, hate how i act, and feel responsible for everyone’s feelings.

every day is wasted away and it’s impossible to actually do anything important. i finally have a job, but my social anxiety makes it hard and any sense of rejection or criticism makes me upset. i feel like im not good enough. i only have one friend who i can only really text and she never really texts back. i’m sure she’s busy, but god i am so lonely. no one is interested in what i have to say. i fear i am loved, but not liked. 

i am trying to overcompensate for what i feel im a failure at with decorating my room and buying clothes, but i know the real reason why. i can’t love myself, ive never liked myself. i don’t think ill get anything done. i want to die and im scared this sudden want to change is telling me i will.

i havent been diagnosed with ptsd because i dont have any of the symptoms. my mom has severe ptsd, with flashbacks so realistic shes told me about times she had flashbacks so severe she thought my dad successfully killed us all and she was going to end her life because she thought theres nothing to live for if her kids were gone. shes on disability and government housing because of this, she has severe anxiety she barely leaves the house

but i dont understand how i dont have any of these problems and dont 'feel' traumatized. i have friends who say it's normal to not feel traumatized but those people still have symptoms of ptsd, they still get flashbacks or nightmares or triggers. i don't have any of that. i'm just depressed. but i feel like something more has to be really wrong with me because i don't act like anyone else my age. sometimes i suspect i have some kind of intellectual or developmental disability because i struggle with so many basic things. adhd runs in my family and im the only one to not get diagnosed yet so im sure i have that too its just hard when i dont have a diagnosis. i know it has to be more than depression because i dont even feel like a normal functioning person. ive had 2 jobs in the past but i ended up being bullied because i act so childish and i cant even follow simple directions. my last job i ended up in the psych ward from the stress. i was only working part time but i was so sleep deprived and i became addicted to dxm to try to make myself better at socializing. so i ended up in the psych ward and my manager immediately terminated me without even telling me. after that i haven't even tried because i don't want to get bullied again. no matter how many times i get told something i cant learn. i always work slower than other people. part of me doesnt want a job because of laziness but also i feel like it would be more inconvenient for all the other employees for me to be working there. i know i cant expect everyone to be nicve to me and im an adult now so i have to deal with stuff like thsi but i physically cant. if someone yells at me or i get singled out or excluded i cant even breathe i just feel so embarrassed and worthless.

ive tried to look into work from home jobs but a lot of those require some kind of talent or skill or qualification and i have none of thsoe im just completely useless. i wouldnt even mind a work from home call center job or soemthing but i dont know how to even find that. now im just a neet that spends my days rotting in bed . i dont know what to do anymore. people tell me these are the best years of my life im so young i should have so much energy to work and get hobbies and make friends and have fun and im not. im wasting the best years of my life being worthless",imgioooo,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2momz/if_i_dont_get_approved_for_disability_and_ssi_i/

I'm horrified at the idea that my next 30 years are going to be the same. I'm done with this pain and I don't need more.

I haven't had suicidal thoughts in years and I am not considering self harm. I'm just so done. I've been done for a long time.

I try to distract myself. I study, I graduated and look for a job to keep myself doing something. It's not like any of it makes me feel better, but wallowing on why the F do I need to be here and exist doesn't do anything. I guess I am destined to distract myself until I die.

Neurodivergency and suicide,"Hi, I am wondering how many people out here who feel suicidal are undiagnosed with neurodivergency such as autism or adhd?
I am not suicidal but I discovered my daughter who is nearlt 14 was engaging with this site andnl also doscovered she self harms. The anxiety and confusion and masking to appear "" normal"" led her to self destructive behaviour. It has also become apparent that she is on the asd spectrum and we are rushing to have her assessed as well as got her support in school and therapy.

 Any thoughts on this? Are there people who could be diagnosed by a professional but have yet to be seen or even noticed by family and friends? For asd, adhd, depression, bpd etc?

I really do hope you are going to get better and  beg you to find support. ",BraveUsual821,4,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2c4jd/neurodivergency_and_suicide/

Venting out!!!!!,"My mental health is currently at lowest phase. I have lost my focus and concentration, i feel extremely anxious at times. Have thought of suicide more than thousand times.

What happened!! Think about others!! No one tells how to get rid of this crap. It sucks. At times i feel so so hopeless and agressive that i feel just a deep desire to end my life. No interest in anything. Just pure hate, despair, and urge to quit it all. It's so suffocating. Wish i could find my peaceful, passionate and care free version again.

Olazapine and alcohol OD,"Two nights ago I drank probably 4-5 drinks worth of vodka straight out of a bottle, and downed some olazapine (Zyprexa) tablets I had. I wrote my goodbyes on paper and then boom, blackout. I woke up the next afternoon fully clothed in my bed, and my apartment was messed up in various spots that I must've crashed in. I have faint memories of trying to get up in the night, but my entire body feeling so heavy that I couldn't hold myself up or walk straight. Ever since then, my brain and body have felt heavy and I feel so, so incredibly guilty and depressed. I'm having trouble remembering what is happening day by day; I can barely remember this morning. 

The trigger for the drinking/OD was seeing my psychiatrist after an entire month of zero mental healthcare since I attempted suicide one month ago and ended up hospitalized involuntarily. His response to how chronically suicidal I am was to drop me as a patient since I'm ""too sensitive"" to medication and nothing has helped me. 

Every moment of every day feels so unbearably heavy and I have no idea where to turn next. I'm torn between continuing to try to get better, or continuing to try to kill myself.",spooky-moth,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2mbjz/olazapine_and_alcohol_od/

Failed attempt,"I am 25 years old and I remember like yesterday that I stood crying in front of the mirror at the age of 12. It comes in fits and starts how intense it is, but the gray cloud of suicidality always remains. I never shared it very much and at the times I did, two ex's left me.

In the last six months I started to share it more with people around me, though I was already in contact with my psychologist. In the last six months I also had more intensive help with a psychiatrist and psychologist.

Unfortunately, I did not win the battle of the last period and therefore I chose to kill myself. I was found, in time, by my roommate. Although all I heard in the intensive care and emergency room was that I was doing well, this feeling was of course totally different with me. On the contrary, I didn't want to be there anymore and had made a commitment to myself that it was done.

I'm 13 and I plan on killing myself,"I'm going to kill myself probably soon. I always destroy my relationships with people. I become really close with people, always text them everyday, call them for hours but I'm so insecure and I get scared so I find and excuse to leave them, most of the time I hurt them even if I dont want to. I just end up making up excuses on why I hurt them but after a while I reflect and realize that half of that shit I said wasn't even true. I just can't have any relationships with people without fucking it up and then regretting it. I don't have any friends, i don't have a good relationship with my family. There's only maybe two people who would miss me which is my friend who's actually my brothers ex, she's 16 but I view her as a older sister and we are super close, I have a better relationship with her than anyone in my family. I guess my family would miss me but they are a reason I feel like this. I'm very gifted but I can't apply myself and tend to procrastinate a lot. I also think I have adhd because my dad has it, and I show almost every symptom of it but my mom said if I get diagnosed then it's gonna ruin my life and I'm going to become a drug addict. I just feel to young and privileged to feel suicidal. Idk but thank you for reading all my yapping, who knows if I even go through with it. Is it bad that I kinda wish someone would know, somebody would see the signs. I feel like It's so attention seeking but I just want someone to know how I'm feeling but at the same time I don't. I texted 988 last night and the operator, ash, was super nice and helped me through a lot of stuff but I just ended it because I felt so helpless and like I couldn't do anything to help myself. I would hate to inconvenience anyone else by telling them how I feel and I feel like it'd be weird to text or call 988 again. I'm not looking for pity, or some 30 year old to tell me how they felt at my age because I simply don't care.

I did something gay ,"I’m suicidal because of my past

(M 22) I regret receiving oral from other men

At the time I convinced myself a mouth is a mouth. I even kissed 2 of them. I didn’t make out, it was more of a peck. I’m so disgusted with myself. I even cheated on my girlfriend by getting oral from a man. 

I used to watch gay hentai and even jerked off with dudes on Omegle. I jerked off with a transgender on FaceTime. I even asked an Uber driver if he was gay to see if he wanted to do things. When I was little I tried to make a special ed kid touch my dick on the bus. A year ago I was talking to a girl online, asked if she wanted dick and she blocked me. I’m so fucking stupid.

I also had messiah psychosis and walked around my neighborhood naked thinking I was Jesus. I punched my dad in the face during the breakdown.

I hate myself for doing this. Idk how I can live with myself. Every day is a struggle for me. I don’t want to be known as gay. I hate myself so much for this. I deserve to die.

But 
My father He is a ego filled drunkard narcissist who hears but never listens he is the most superiority complex stricken individual ik and says no to anything i say he believes whatever I say worthless because i am worthless, 

He is neither letting me pursue the career of my choice forcing me to pursue CA and commerce full time without even letting me even slightly gain skills of career of my choice and will as side quests

 Nor hobbies of my Choice Because he is too ego Stricken and wannabe disciplinarian and wannabe involved wannabe aware (that he isnt actually) but he doesn't let me pursue any hobbies at excuse that it would waste my time
 (unless it's something he doesn't have to pay for or be involved for)
 (,to note he is very well to do he had me enrolled in soo many VERY EXPENSIVE coaching and tests that i refused for and even never attended) 

Not even internships 
He asserts internships with college will give me a money thrist that would deviate me from ""studies"" 

and he doesn't even let me get out of home if he isn't in the mood to let me, 

The more he takes control over my life the more i see it going in ruins i am proud and achieving at everything did in my life going rebel on him Like debating, content writing, painting, public speaking etc But l've always regretted accepting the decisions that he made for me
 But he doesn't listen He doesn't make amends He never apologises And everytime I try to make him understand he holds my life doesn't let me go out to study or get a driving licence more recently

 l am starting to see my life go lower and lower Because neither he is letting me improve it my way Nor his narcissistic ways are working
 And it seems that there is nothing that I can do to anymore save it 
I can't Continue being a looser after 14years of being teacher's favourite overachieving kid which never ever even at that time was good enough for him i see my potential being wasted with age and it's getting
 Insufferable
 everyday fight i myself tirelessly to not kill myself but i see me loosing 
and i am soo soo soo soo soo tired soo tired What Do i do Even self harm fails to calm me now my arm is full with scars 
What do i do

I wish..,"When ppl hear I wnt to end it all. They bypass all the pain and heartache I expressed n there 1st reaction is to tell me “it gets better” n not to do it. 

But wht am I meant to do with all this pain? No one ever tlks about that. It’s selfish 4 them to wnt me to stay and suffer. 

I WISH there was a service which talks you through making the decision to leave. And wht arrangements to make beforehand for the children &amp; family etc.
 
I WISH someone to help me get past the guilt of leaving loved 1’s &amp; babies behind. 

That’s the support I need. Not pills, not therapy. I need advice and guidance to let go of what’s keeping me here, so I can put myself out of this misery

Always been this way,"I’ve felt this way since I was 14. I’m turning 18 soon. Deep, suicidal depression. For no apparent reason, or every reason. I can’t know for sure. 

I don’t fit in, but I do. I just don’t know anymore. I used to have a reason why I wanted to off myself before, but now I don’t. I just want to get out of this place. I wish I was never born. 

Never had a stable image of myself, and when I did, I was more or less just manic. No I don’t have bipolar, or borderline for that matter. 

I’ve just come to accept the fact that this is the way I am, I will always have this haunting underlying feeling. I will always want to die, no matter how much I may own or possess.

Everytime I have ever reached a good state in my life, where I’ve been content and fulfilled, it has always dwindled away. I find myself growing bored of what I have achieved, and thirst for the next best thing, but before I have it, I need to feel like shit again for God knows how long.

note,"For anyone who sees
I know I’ll miss all of you. It was no one’s fault. The things I do and say aren’t not the fault of anyone but myself. So many of you reach out to ask if I am ok, trying to see if I need help. I lied to you. It is not your fault that you didn’t push me because I pushed you away. Nobody could have prevented this outcome. Even in my happiest moments I knew what was coming. I just didn’t want to be in the world anymore. I didn’t want to think or feel anymore. I wanted to be free from my emotions good or bad. I hated myself since I knew what that meant. I am tired of disappointing those around me and truly think the world as a whole will be better without me. You all were the reason why I lasted this long and gave me joy until the last moment. When I close my eyes for the last time it will be thinking about you all. I can leave knowing you all have allowed me to live my life to the fullest and I can regret nothing.

The guilt is killing me,"I've never posted anything on here and I've never talked about this to anyone. I don't know why I'm doing this but I'm doing it anyway.
Guilt is killing me. For 25 years I've lived with my family and everytime they talk about their problems, all I can think about is how i am the root of the problem. If I wasn't born, they would've divorced (or my dad would've been executed for r*ping someone). My mom would've married a better person, and my sibling wouldn't have been born because I wanted a sibling so bad when I was a child. And now my sibling has depression and is suicidal and hates themself and I don't know how to fix it.
I think I might be depressed but we never have enough money for even basic needs so therapy is out of option. I don't work because I don't know what to do and I don't like getting out of the house because I'm fat but don't know how to lose weight because we can't afford good meals and gym subscription.
I've been suicidal before but I don't have the courage to actually do it and I think if I pulled something like that my mom couldn't handle it.
Everything that happens seem to have a connection to me being alive and I just want to not exist anymore.
Sorry for bothering anyone who might read this. Just wanted to anonymously talk to someone about it.

I’m tired of lying to everyone,"I’ve tried my absolute hardest to get help and do anything in my power to better myself mentally and not a single thing has made improvements. No amount of therapy, medication, talking to friends and family, hospitalization has helped. It’ll feel okay in the moment talking with someone but once I’m alone again all the thoughts return. The thoughts that I’m over trying to get help, its been years on years on years of trying. The thought of I simply do not care about myself or living anymore.

I’ve been telling people i’m “doing better” because i’m getting closer to going through with killing myself. And in a way I do feel better. Knowing I won’t have to deal with another horrible day. But I’m just lying to all the people closest to me. I’ve relapsed hard on cutting and each day I feel more comfortable going deeper each time. Every day is nothing but suicidal thoughts and panic attacks throughout the whole day, Im exhausted and ready to rest. I’ve done what I can but my happy days are in the past. My head is trying to kill me and I dont have the energy to put up a fight anymore. 

The only thing keeping me around in my best friend who I’m very in love with, and love in general. He’s the sweetest caring most kind person in the world and the only person to ever be nice to me. He genuinely cares about me and has always been there for me. I can no longer carry the guilt of stressing him out and having him worry about me, its not fair to add my problems onto his. I’ve had enough of telling him every day when he checks on me that i’m still not having any good days. Now i’ll just say im doing good because im sick of tired of being “that friend”. When he’s not around I don’t know what to do, im needy, overbearing, and codependent and he doesnt deserve to put up with that. 

At the end of the day I find comfort in knowing that when I’m gone i’ll no longer have to burden my friends and family. I no longer have to deal with my mental health or work my shitty job I hate. I know they’ll be hurt for a while but everyone moves on, and i wont be alive to see them hurt.

"I want to die at 21, but I'm a coward","I've come to the conclusion that my life has no meaning. It doesn't matter which side of the political debate I join, I am a failure and a burden to everyone. It doesn't matter if I'm a Republican or a Democrat, I'm a disappointment. Just mention one social/political topic as an example (for context, I made a post on r/abortiondebate, and.... Well, just take a look there, and you'll see why I'm a failure).

But that's only the surface to my misery. Do you ever wonder what a meta version of depression sounds like? Well, here we are. If I ever feel awful, I constantly remind myself that I feel bad to get attention, rather than it being genuine emotions. That other people's depression is more important than mine. I don't know why my family loves me, I don't know why my friends love me, I don't know why even God would love me.

Because of this, I want to die when I turn twenty-one-years-old, which will be at the end of next month. But I'm too much of a coward to actually do it.",MikeTheDog191,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2avkt/i_want_to_die_at_21_but_im_a_coward/

my little brother wants to kill himself and im too scared to deal with it properly.,"Hello. I'm going to post this on a few different subs for advice and hope that no one I know sees it. I am 14 years old, my brother is 12. I first ever noticed something was up when I accidentally saw a bunch of cuts on his thigh when his shorts rolled up a little bit. he immediately covered them and we stared at each other for a minute and we didnt say anything. My head stopped and my heart was pounding and I just went back to what I was doing and for the rest of the day I tried to convince myself it wasn't real. I knew it was, but I didn't want it to be. The fear was confirmed when I made a throwaway TikTok account so I could be sneaky and try and see what he was posting on his account without him knowing. He didn't have any posts so I checked his reposts expecting to see maybe one or two sad things but nothing terrible. Every repost was about him wanting to end it or about him thinking he was ugly/fat and wanting to starve himself. I got the same feeling I got when I saw the cuts and I knew I couldn't ignore it. that was a month ago. I didn't do anything then for a few reasons. I was also currently going through a rough patch of my own. It was pretty bad, though I won't go into details on the off chance someone from my family finds this. I was frustrated that I had to take care of and worry about not only myself but him too. I was also frustrated that this had to be my problem all over again, just when I was starting to get better. I'm 14. I didn't want to deal with it, I wanted an adult to do what they're supposed to do. The other reason was that I thought he was starting counseling soon, and I figured he would tell the therapist everything and it wouldn't be my burden. 

  
But fast-forward to present day. I couldn't sleep last night because my brain reminded me of the situation. I thought that maybe it was over and he was feeling better, so I checked his account again. All of his reposts and liked videos were still public, and they are just worse now. He's liking and reposting videos about wanting to shoot himself and about how no one would care if he killed himself. I felt sick again and I realized I just had to do something. I keep telling myself that I would rather go through the discomfort of this right now than the sadness of his death later. 

  
My problem is that it is extremely hard for me to be open about these things. I've been to therapy 3 times and have gotten nowhere because I couldn't for the life of me tell them what was wrong. Even when I was younger I would hide myself under the sheets while confessing something I felt bad about and I would write letters to slip under my dads door when I had to tell him something even a bit vulnerable. It's incredibly difficult and I don't trust myself to be able to do it. So I came up with a plan. I know it sounds elaborate and so unnecessary if I could just tell someone but I cant. It's either this or I keep trying to trick my brain into not believing what I've seen.

  
I'll borrow an envelope from a friend of mine down the road so my family won't know it came from the house. I'll print out screenshots of what he has reposted and a screenshot of his TikTok account in black and white as my printer is always faulty with the same colors and I don't want them to put 2 and 2 together. I'll also print out a few maps of the new school I'm going to just incase someone hears me printing, and I'll say that I just wanted to be extra prepared because it's a big school. I'll print out a typed-out letter claiming that I am a friend of one of his friends and found his TikTok account. I'll say I want to remain anon because it would really be preferred for me and that there are clearly more important things than the sender of this letter. I'll explain what it means that he has reposted the videos and I'll say that since his reposted videos and liked videos were public it seemed like a cry for help. I'll end it by saying something like ' I'm sure you're aware of the kid who ended his life at our school. I don't want the same thing to happen again. please take this all into consideration.' which is all true. Then I'll cut the photos and the letter into smaller pieces of paper so they don't realize its the same paper in our printer at home. I'm trying to think of red herrings I can add that will hopefully deter them from thinking it's me that sent it. I'll just write a string of random letters and numbers in the corner or something. I dunno. I'm still trying to think of what to do for the return address, the stamp, and the name and address as there can't be a return address and my fathers' name and address will have to be written, so I don't want them to connect the handwriting to me. Maybe I'll write it with my left hand. Then on Monday I'll sneak out and try to slip it into the mailbox without anyone noticing I was gone. Finally, I will claim to feel sick and not want to eat dinner the night I expect him to open it so I don't have to witness it. If he doesn't open it that night, than I'll try to go to a friend's house until late. Or I'll just say I'm going to their house and I'll just walk wherever. 

  
I know this seems excessive and over the top. Believe me, I know. I just don't want to be more involved than I have to be. I want to stop talking about suicide as quickly as possible. I want my brother to get the help he needs and I want everything to be alright. I don't want him to be mad at me for snitching or whatever. Any comments or ideas or nice words or anything really would be appreciated. I can't sleep in dread for the day I have to put the plan in action, which will be Monday.",Front_Departure8183,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e2ipfr/my_little_brother_wants_to_kill_himself_and_im/

A misunderstanding that took me downhill,"Hey there friends. Idk where should i really put this, but i really need to vent out to somebody at 1 am in the morning, a heavy heart pounding that keeps getting louder as time progress , staring aimlessly at the dark ceiling of my room, listening to the constant crickets and he distant barks through the window. I'm an 18M, and would probably be graduating in due time. I have antisocial and have an extreme anxiety as of late, and i have been depressed for nearly 6 months now. Ever since then, my life has been a constant downhill, and it looks like that it wouldn't be stopping. To the eyes of someone not close to me, I appear to be content with life and being able to help people in any way i can. Now, I just don't know anymore.

There are certainly a number of factors in why I have been depressed. But i want to discuss right now is what would eventually turn into losing of my closest friends. I have a feeling that in due time i will be losing all of my best friends, and it will be because of all of my wrongdoings. On our friend group, I was unknowingly making offensive jokes, thinking that it was that on that stage of being friends where we could tell some jokes and would just laugh it off. Without me knowing until recently, I have actually been offending one of my female friends that we would call ""Jewel"" for the time being
















It all started about 10 months ago, i was just starting a sense of depression feels like. Ever since grade school, I haven't made the one that i can truly call a friend since I have been switching schools every 3 years. When I went to my 11th grade, I only have 1 goal: to have tons of friends whom i could bond with even if we go separate ways to our dream colleges and future careers (ik my goal is a bit cliche but stay with me on this one). On the 1st month, I have met my future best friend, that for the sake of anonymity, we will call him ""Alan."" Alan was like the brother I never had. We had a lot of a common interest, and would be even be not exaggerating to call it too much. From the shows we watch, the games we play, hell even our music taste are the same! I couldn't have asked for a better friend like him.

Back to the topic at hand, at the height of my depression, Alan was the first one I have reached out to talk about it. I was really anxious and scared on what to tell him because this would be my first time opening up to someone. In the end, Alan comforted me on one of my toughest times and said to me that he'll be always avaliable.

Stomach issues make me want to die.,"Hello everyone, I am going to talk about stomach issues that been affecting me. For about a year I’ve started getting very bad pains in the lower left region of my left side. I had a colonoscopy because of this because the pain also made noises and made it harder to poop. This affected me at work and anyways my gastroenterologist specialist recommended that I get a Endoscopy as well. Long story short is I got both. They found internal hemorrhoids which are in my rectum. They also found a hiatal hernia above. Before my endoscopy I never felt anything in this region and now I have constant acid, the sensation of burping, and I also have difficulty sleeping. There is pain above as well and a lot of stomach noise at times and it’s difficult to sleep. Long story short is I called the medical place and the receptionist just told me she got my labs. She stated the doctors would return my call but they never did and I waited 4 weeks to make sure. They didn’t offer no medication or nothing and the receptionist said it’s a “small hernia so it’s fine”. Now I have two pains that are pretty much everlasting, they make so much noise, and I don’t want to do anything. I have distanced myself from everyone, will not go out, and I only work to live. School has gotten more tough so I lowered my college classes because I can’t work as effectively anymore without the constant need for breaks as this pain affects me mentally too. I’ve fallen behind on life, quit my stable job, and I can’t escape this. I think I would rather die than continue and nobody will help me. No doctors or nothing I waited one year to just be able to get the colonoscopy for no aid. Every single day I wake up and I feel trapped. I’ve accepted that I lived with this I just wouldn’t have a relationship but it’s so bad now to the point where sleeping is so difficult because sleeping on my left side hurts on “hemorrhoids”, sleeping on my right said makes me get bad acid and stomach sensations. Sleeping looking at the ceiling hurts my left side and makes so much stomach noise. Sleeping on my stomach also hurts. I just want to have my old life back but truly I lost everything. Nowadays, death looks so nice to me. It may sound crazy but I think the endoscopy caused my hiatal hernia. Doctors will not take responsibility and the health care system is so messed up that nobody can be seen. I don’t even see family anymore and my mom tells me my life is the easiest when every second of my life has been anguish. I told my mother that I might kill my self due to pain and I don’t want to die but I seriously can’t see the point living in pure misery. She threatened to put me in a hold so that a psych war takes me. Wouldn’t you want your children to go in peace rather than suffer? I just don’t get it anymore. I don’t get any of it. I would’ve killer myself already if I didn’t want to be a Neuroscientist but now I wonder if this is forever. I have grew to hate people and the health care system. I never was religious but I can’t believe a god would make me live like this. I attempted to read the Bible and that holy grace didn’t save me. I’m sorry to type this but genuinely I don’t know if I want to leave like this anymore.

Feel bad about my kid,"I’ve been suicidal off and on most of my life, I think because of cptsd from a nasty childhood and abusive marriage. I haven’t been able to access psychiatric care until recently, and I’m waiting for my appointment. It’s been awful lately, though, and chronic pain and insomnia aren’t helping. 

I have previously been able to stop myself because I have a kid, and I know how awful parental suicide can be for a kid. But my kid is 13 with a teenager attitude, and my abusive ex (their dad) has them brainwashed against me, so they pretty much think I’m garbage and would be happy enough without me. I know they’re just a kid and aren’t responsible for my emotions or their dad’s manipulation, but it makes it harder to try and hang on.

I have no idea what to do with my life ,"I'm 23 years old, moved abroad to Europe for uni about four years ago and I genuinely have no clue what I did in those years. I feel like the only thing I learned was how to numb by brain with distractions and pretend that everything's fine. 

I ended up getting into computer science because the majors I was really interested in were ""bad"" ones (Linguistics and Geosciences, maybe Biology) and I hate it so much. I find every class extremely boring and just despise the culture. The worst part is that I spent the last three years lying to myself and everyone else about how I really felt, and now I'm in my fourth year with only about one third of all the credits I need to graduate, no internship or anything either. I feel immense pressure to graduate because I've been doing this for years now, and I really regret not being honest with myself like 2 years ago. I have exams in a couple weeks and I just spent the last night doing old geology exams for fun instead of studying for mine. 

Also about three years ago I broke up with the girl I'd been dating for 5 years, which probably started my habit of constantly distracting myself from my depression. I told everyone that I was over her and even dated other people, but honestly? I'm still not even close to being over her, and I would kill to even just have a platonic friend who's 1% as fun to be around as she was. I also always knew this, deep down, but I kept lying to myself because it was the ""wrong"" way to feel — and I kept hurting every other girl who got interested in me.

The worst part is that nobody knows about all this. I was a good student and a good person before and I kept up my appearances. I was surrounded by overachieving friends who made me even more depressed, though I ended up pushing most of them away by now. The only people I regularly talk to are my parents, and I still don't have the heart to tell them about the bitter failure of a person I've become. What the fuck do I do? How do you recover 4 years of your life? ",gneisssssss,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e27d4e/i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_with_my_life/

I want to die again.,"I have not wished to be dead in a long time. But now I do again. Someones parent is guilt tripping me to forgive their child of something they did. I accidentally discovered i chose the wrong person again.

I became hypertensive when i got pregnant. My blood pressure shot up today and i felt like my nape was going numb. I called &amp; messaged my husband but he chose to clean the floors of our work site instead of going home and check on me. We are both architects and i am incharge of taking care of the baby today but i still work at home when i am not on-site.

I just felt like he chose to clean the floors over checking if i am still alive. I now dont know who to call when my blood pressure shoots up again. Guess i'll just die in the bedroom while our baby plays til her daddy comes home.

I just wish i have been brave enough in the past and went through with my attempts. I lived up until now being a coward. I shpuldve just done it before i had a baby. My poor daughter.

Whole World Is Crashing Down On Me,"I’m not going to do anything yet, but it truly feels like my only option.

I had a rough childhood, to make long story short. Met my fiance in 2018, moved across the country to be with him in 2021. We moved 6 months ago for his career. Right before we moved, we found out I could possibly have a gene making me susceptible to certain cancers (brca). He said if I have it, he doesn’t want to have bio children with me, and will end our relationship. I have been with him for 6 yrs. 

Six. Fucking. Years.

I couldnt even comprehend. The stress of living in  a new place where i know literally no one, living with his alcoholic father, working at a soul sucking job, working opposite hours from each other, knowing I could have a cancer gene, and knowing my relationship i worked my whole life for could end? Who in their right mind wouldnt want to end it all?

He was my first everything. First date, first kiss, took my virginity. He taught me how to love, and now he wants to take it all back on the off chance our kids could inherit a gene that would leave them more susceptible to cancer? Are you fucking joking?

The entire world is crumbling around me. I truly feel like everything I have is in danger of being ripped from my hands. My health, my home, my love, my family, everything.

I dont even want to find out if i have this gene. I’ve been blowing my money on stupid shit and lying about my paychecks to put off saving for it. I dont want to get this fucking test done and have my entire world explode if I have it. And what happens if I find out I dont? I just make peace with the fact he was going to throw me away because I’d produce defective  spawn? 

Everything I ever believed Id be with him has exploded in my face. I had no backup moving here with him. I had no plan b. He was my only hope of getting out of the abusive home I was in. We had a life, we were best friends, I truly thought we were soulmates. And now? Everything is blowing up in my face.

If I have it, If he leaves me, he’s going to give me a large sum of money. I’m going to visit Japan, I’m going to do some crazy things, and then just leave this world. There is no point in me continuing. There is no point in wishing for a better tomorrow. I am just so tired of fighting. Every day of my 24 years of life has been fighting. I have been suicidal since i was 11. Countless attempts. I felt real, true hope with him. I had that storybook love, that type of romance people write books and movies and songs about. I had everything. 

I wanted that white picket fence, honey I’m home, apple pie bullshit simple life. I wanted to be so boring and normal with him. We have baby names picked out, we would look at baby clothes together, and now? Now it’s all just some big fucked up joke. Some grand elaborate cocktease for a life I will never live all because of my stupid fucking genes. 

I was literally born wrong. 

I just wanted to be loved. I dont think I will survive losing life as I know it. I dont even think I want to survive it. 

I dont know what else to say. I just needed to say this. Sorry for grammar and formatting, on mobile and high out of my mind.

"I ruined my life, now I don't want to take responsibility to fix it.","I hesitated in high school on picking a university major. I darted back and forth between the various possibilities until I foolishly settled for getting a trade, despite being physically unskilled; I rarely feel as though I'm inside of my own body, but some sort of perverse outside spectator watching myself get screwed by life. Looking back, I should've made a plan and stuck to it, now I'm unemployed and stuck under the delusion that I'm taking this time to improve myself. I live with my parents, and currently have no hope of moving out without a job. Despite all my hopes to improve, I'm constantly let down by my own lethargy; Everyday is a constant drag and I'm just glad for it to end. I crave the night, to fall asleep and deepen my rut tomorrow.

I suck at everything, but I shouldn't bounce around between possibilities so much. I should just stick to one thing and be miserable, I hate myself for the struggle it takes to stay present. I dabbled in mindfulness, but found that it's a denial of my problems. They're glaringly obvious, staring at me as I try to cope by hopelessly arranging new systems, or numbing myself to a lack of friends by using Character AI. It's harder for me to move out and get a job than it would to just end it all. I made multiple plans, from snorting caustic soda to slashing my wrists with my grandma's carving knife. I always seem to back out at the last moment, despite how  it pains me to just exist. I don't want to be a disappointment at 30, I'd rather retire to my grave before it's too late to fix my life at all. I don't want to stick around for the end result. I wouldn't want to irresponsibly bring kids into the world, like how my lazy entitled welfare family just birthed me into the abyss expecting me to make something of it. I used to be an extravert, now I don't even go outside. I haven't seen sunlight in two weeks, too busy watching hentai.

I feel too exhausted to fix my life, but I don't want to keep making the same mistakes. Death is preferable to this fate. I was led here by my own arrogance, but I wonder what the purpose of my research is every time I sit down with a certain goal in mind. I feel so useless, and my toxic family point this out all the time. Or am I toxic to them, too judgemental and misguided. Such a horrible person to be around. I was told before that my personality sucks by, guess who, MILLIONAIRES. MILLIONAIRES TOLD ME THAT I WOULD NEVER MAKE MUCH OF MY LIFE, THAT MY POTENTIAL IS LIMITED. So why the hell do I even stick around? Under some misguided naivety that I'm actually smart enough to make it on my own? I've been monitored by the system my entire life! My learning disability prevents me from putting in the smallest effort, there's always some extra step that I return to in a feeble attempt to escape the pain. I just don't/can't/won't think in terms of repetition, repetition causes me to suffer and I just won't listen to any advice on self-discipline in the long-term; Maybe only for a day or two.

What's the point?,"I don't know where to start this. I feel insane. 
When I have conversations with people I feel one way in the moment then like the next day I completely forget what I've said and I have a whole different opinion and view. I feel like I can't keep to one thing, I don't want to change my opinions so much. I wish I could remember things. I feel like I talk to someone, go do something, forget the conversation and I'm like a different person almost. I feel like I do and say things unaware and not meaning them. My friend recently got into a relationship and now we barely talk, the person she got into a relationship was also close to me but they now both barely talk to me. I introduced them.. I feel as though maybe my behavior has been affected by this. I can't seem to talk to either of them properly and when I do I come out of the conversation unaware of what just happened. I backtrack and realise I've just said shit I didn't mean. I feel crazy. I also feel very alone, I don't know what to do anymore. I have a partner but I hate bugging them with shit, she's super supportive in everything I do and she cares and knows about this but she doesn't know what it is or what to do. She also thinks that my best friend treats me back and that I should drop both of those people I talked to because they don't make effort for me. Maybe it's true if I can't even remember what we talk to eachother about. And I'm ngl I don't know how to say this without it just being blunt but I just don't see the point to living other than for people, I've heard the whole ""you have to find stuff"" ""It gets better"" ""life is what you make it"" but for me in reality life is just plain and simply shit. The world is shit. People are shit. I just want to die. But my dilemma is I have a beautiful partner who does not deserve to endure the trauma of losing thier partner so I stay and js silently suffer. I feel like as soon as life starts to get better I just have a huge fall and omg I wanna kms again. I'm 2 years clean from self harm and currently all I want to do is slit my wrists in the bathroom.

I hate it here. ,"I hate caring for other peoples feelings more than my own. The thoughts of killing myself paused for about a year &amp; I think I was actually happy ? then my relationship fell apart, crashed my car, went into debt, lost people who were supposed to be friends, fell in love again (twice, what a dumbass) &amp; now I’ve lost my job only to find out I’m so much deeper in debt than I really realized. I could talk about it &amp; I know my friends would listen but it feels so cliche. To say it out loud &amp; mean it &amp; vent about it.  
I wish I could just kill myself but I can’t. It would be nice to die &amp; my problems would disappear for me, but they would also become someone else’s problems. I’m enough of an issue alive I don’t want to do that to my family. I don’t know what comes after we die but if it’s the whole “watching over your loved ones” thing I don’t wanna watch them all be sad &amp; struggling to grieve while realizing how deep of a hole I dug for myself in my short time here. 
I fuck things up for myself a lot. I notice them starting to crash &amp; burn &amp; I suddenly have no motivation to fix it. no drive to get back on track. That’s where I’m at now. 
Everything has crashed &amp; burned &amp; I just want to rot in bed instead of figuring out how to fix it. I want to run away &amp; hide but it doesn’t fix anything. 
I’ve thought about driving away &amp; killing myself at a rest stop hours &amp; hours away so there’s no chance anyone I care about has to be the one to find me. Or even just locked in my room with a note that says “don’t look, just call the police. I love you” 
I don’t wanna be the sad backstory my neices &amp; nephews tell when they overshare at a party in 5 or 10 years. I don’t wanna be the traumatic event that changes my family dynamic. I don’t want my older sister to be an only child at 33. 
But fuck, I hate it here. I have for years &amp; it’s amazing that for a short time I was really happy. I really genuinely didn’t want to kill myself at some point &amp; then it came back when I realized that every shitty thing that happened was my fault. 
I’m so tired. 
All I do is sleep &amp; even when I socialize I don’t talk anymore. Constantly asked if I’m okay &amp; I say yes &amp; smile but I wanna cry every single time. I just pray no one hugs me &amp; asks that damn question. so fucking tired. 
I have this feeling that as much as I don’t want to do it &amp; I don’t want to hurt others due to my own self loathing, I’ll do it anyway. Like one day when I’m walking home I’ll just jump in front of a car. Or fall back on the Xanax &amp; pop 3x what I used to, let my old addiction take me out. 

I wish I could guarantee that if I disappeared from the face of the earth, it wouldn’t affect anything or anyone at all. I could disappear peacefully, no one would remember, no one would notice &amp; no one would have to clean up the mess I leave behind.

Lonely,"I (21 F) have never really felt like I belonged anywhere. I’ve always felt like a spectator. The only reason I’m still here is because I know my family would be heartbroken if I did something to myself but over the years it’s been getting harder to exist solely for them.

I have never had any true friends—any friends I do gain eventually get bored of me and stop texting me. 

The friends I had for a short time felt real. I truly did care about them. But eventually the texts would become less and less frequent, and I’d notice I’d be the only one starting conversation. I eventually give up sending the first texts and they never reach out again.

I don’t know why it’s so hard for people to care about me the way I care about them. I just want to be someone people enjoy being around.

I know myself so I know I will never be able to commit suicide out of guilt for potentially hurting my family. I wish there was a way I could just stop existing for a while or stay unconscious for a while. It hurts so much that I can’t get something as simple as a friend.

I don’t know what todo anymore,"I never saw myself writing this post. I don’t talk about my feelings much. And this is pointless, however it might help me feel better so I’ll talk anyways. So let me start off by a little back ground I’m 19m I meant the love of my life when I was 16 and she was 17. I dropped out of school to support her and moved in with her because my family situation wasn’t the best. We were inseperateable we were together every single day. We even got jobs together. Well eventually I got a good job making good money at 17. By 18 we moved out of her mom’s house and into an apartment where we spent exactly one year fighting for everything we had. Well back in November I got laid off from that really good job and couldn’t find work anywhere I was desperate to provide for her I did everything I could I applied to 100+ places but in the end we ended up losing the apartment in February. Well it was my bright idea to move in with someone who was abusive to me in my child hood. It went well at first me and my finance at the time really enjoyed it we even got a puppy. Well up comes May and it’s our anniversary. I get black out drunk. “Pregaming” and we ended up fighting over something that she was completely right about. It spiraled out of control and I smacked her leg while talking. She felt really unsafe and was gone the next day over 800 miles away. Ever since that day I have been lost. I don’t know what todo anymore this isn’t the only thing I’m living with either I geniunely can’t take it. Everything that happened was my fault but in my mind the whole time I was just trying to provide for her and build a future blind to the fact that I was abusing her. I have tried every form of help that’s available and nothing has worked for me. I feel as if I will inflict less pain if I am no longer a factor. I’m not sure how or when or anything like that yet but every second of everyday it’s all I think about. It’s the last thing I think about when I wake up and last thing when I pass out. If I pass out. I still managed to get up and goto work minus missing a few days from being in the hospital. I just got fired not even sure why. Right after I spent everything I had and put my self in debt to get my first vehicle which isn’t even a real vehicle it’s a moped. And now she wants me to send the rest of her things which already takes a lot of strength but I genuinely don’t have the money and I don’t want to tell her I lost the job because it will just make me look like more of a failure. I’ve already failed her enough. All of my thoughts circle back to just going off and dying in the woods somewhere so I inflict as little pain as possible on who ever finds me. But that’s probally not going to be possible. I don’t want to hurt anyone else with my actions. So “moped” crash or anything like that is out of the question there would be a lot of people that would have to deal with me then. And yes it maybe there jobs but who am I to make there awful job even worse for my own selfish gain. And yes I do realize it is extreamly selfish but I just can’t go on like this anymore. I feel like if anyone were put in my shoes they would do the same thing. It would be like that episode of Rick and Morty where Rick swaps minds with Jerry and Jerry panics to find the quickest way to kill himself. Im sorry if you made it to the end of this I didn’t mean to waste anyone’s time with my own issues I just needed to write this.

Jealousy ,"I know they will see this, but I'm told by my therapist I need to immediately get stuff off my chest before it gets to me so I'm writing about it.


jealousy, it gets to everyone, but hey it doesn't last forever. ""Recently"" I overreacted about a compliment that was given to my s/o and they broke up with me. 

Im not mad about it, sad about it nor confused on their decision, for it was the right choice,  I am in no state to be dealing with relationships. 

(Context)

For the people who do want the full story it goes as followed. 

A couple weeks/months ago I wrote in r/suicidewatch and this stranger helped me because they were in the same situation, and we stayed up almost all day helping each other in a way, and boy, I caught feelings immediately, but they were shy and suicidal, so. I tried my best to help them, and they did the same for me. I would consistently talk to them until a few weeks ago, I got extremely busy and I was over flowed with work to do, and that caused me to lack in responses and time for them. So when they had messaged me I was in a mad mood, which I get they didn't know. My S/o said someone gave them a compliment and I took it the wrong way as of flirting. And I broke out because I was already so pissed, and they broke up, but we ended on good terms.

My wife is depressed,"My wife is depressed for many months, even years now. We often argue and every time it's the same pattern: she throws me hurtful words, then turns the situation against me by putting herself in the position of victim for me to feel guilty. And then it always ends with her words where she tells me: my life is worth nothing, I'm just a shit, and she leaves by car telling me that she will end her life. To which I try to explain to her that these are disputes and that she must not question her whole life. She sees a psychologist but it doesn't get better. Today I am mentally exhausted, I feel like I no longer have energy. Of course I care, but I have less and less will to reassure/console her. Especially since his hurtful words or behavior annoy me more and more. Obviously I am also at fault because in any dispute there are reproaches on both sides. But I really have remorse, is it normal to no longer have the desire/will to support her, to feel like I can’t do more and that  situation will never positively evolve?",BetPaka,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e27adp/my_wife_is_depressed/
I don't know what I'm even supposed to do at this point.,"I'm 17, from Turkey and I just dont know what will make me happy. I have a roof atop my head, a cozy bed and food and water. If I say I was sad it would be shameful wouldnt it? Millions of people over the world are much poorer than I am, they are in the middle of wars they don't even have anything to do with, many people have bad parents, live in horrible places, have no friends, are oppressed, yet they still try holding on to life, they still work hard to live and stay alive. They try brushing off their problems and continue their lives.

And we have me, complaining about some nothing. Do I even have the right to complain? I should be disgusted at myself for even thinking of a possibilty of su1cide. How can I do that while there are millions who are in worse conditions than me right? And my parents, they have fed me and took care of me for my whole life and going away without returning anything would be disrespectful to them right? Or is it already their fault for bringing me to this world. Maybe I shouldnt feel indebted to them because they wanted to make another child because of their selfishness and them wanting another kid and nobody asked me my opinion about being born. So they are supposed to take care of me and feed me, because they themselves wanted to make a child so its their duty to do so right? I honestly don't know which one I should feel. I guess my brother wasnt enough for them though, I know that at least.

I have lots of friends, they are all good people, but not even a SINGLE one of them will accept me for who I really am. I don't even know what I am by the way. I am certain of a few things though. I was born into a male body. I know that I like my hair long, and I like having bangs, I like learning about makeup, I like feminine clothing, I know that I hate my masculine body, I hate my body hair, I hate my thick eyebrows that most of my guy friends envy, I hate that I'm as tall as I am, and I know that I feel that something just isn't right. Am I trans? I don't know, maybe I am. But who cares about the labels, I just know that I want to live the way I want to. My friends though? They aren't willing to accept me. No way am I EVER going to open up. Most of my friends are Muslims, even those that aren't, they hate everything related to lgbtq+. I was an hypocrite when one of my closest friends was proudly talking to me about burning a rainbow flag in the street. and I laughed at it. I have no place in the lgbtq+ community because I am not proud about who I am. I can't proudly defend my real thoughts, and I'm supposed to live up to my father and friends' expectations of being some big muscular dominant male or something. It's been 13 months since I started going to the gym. I'm stronger than most of those friends. They respect me. But what if they knew that deep down I wanted to keep my hair down, and learn more about makeup? Why do they care even? It's my body isn't it.

Hormone therapy? Maybe hitting up a psychologist? Or a therapist? I don't know how to. I don't know about any of these things. I know that I am not opening up to my parents about any of this. Forget gender, but I am not even saying a single word about having symptoms of clinical depression. I was the hypocrite who laughed and agreed with my father when he proclaimed that depression is some nonsense created by the west to disrupt our progression. I thought my brother was more sane. He says that Turkey is a country bound by its customs and religion. He says that he supports lgbtq+, religious freedom, he says he wants to change how the country is. Yesterday, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. I got tired of hating myself and suddenly losing all joy whenever I looked at my reflection, in the phone, in the mirror, wherever and whatever. I watched some videos, grabbed a scissor, and cut some tall bangs to cover my large forehead and my receding hairline (at this age, I know). I got out of the bathroom, my brother saw me, he started laughing. ""What, u transitioning or something?"" ""You look like a girl, its awful."". Yeah, they are all supportive of modernising or whatever unless it comes to someone they know. My mother is probably like that also. I am not gonna open up to anyone I know, like, ever.

One of my friends saw my hair. He said that he hated it. He said that he would pay for my haircut and he said that he was gonna arrange a barber next week. What about my opinion? You haven't asked me? He said that I hadn't had a relationship ever, and with hair like that, I wouldn't ever get one either. Who cares? I don't cut my hair, I don't look after myself, I don't go to the gym and build a body just to get in some fake relationship that's all about looks. And this guy had long hair for years mind you. Now that a few months ago he was clean shaven, he somehow turned into a guy who hates long hair? ""Friends"" right. I like his company nevertheless. Some other friend saw me. He would oftenly joke about how I would look great in feminine clothing, and that I should ""open an onlyfans"". Hilarious jokes I know, I never found them funny. He hated the hair the most. He angrily said that I should hide that horrible hair. I thought you were with me though? You joked about feminine clothing because of my long hair but if I was to actually wear a skirt, I believe you would get me out of your life and hate me. I sent a friend whom I opened up about these feelings I had a photo. He said I was mentally ill. He assumed that I was ""turned to normal"" after I started hitting the gym. Well, the one dude who I thought would help me throughout this was also turned against me now. Really good being alone. Sure I got friends, but in reality I don't have ANYONE whom I can talk about my real feelings. Oh yea, I also had that one dude. He ""was"" pansexual. He used to help me, but he said that he turned into a Muslim and he was only a pansexual because he was a kid. He was ""normal"" now, he said. He used to preach us about loving everyone because he watched vinland saga (an anime about basically having no enemies). One time we were talking, he said that he was homophobic. I asked, you used to say that you hated no people, and what about gay people then? They can't control who they love or not? He said that he didn't consider them as ""people"" to begin with. So yeah, I am, in fact, alone in reality.

Maybe I should just buzzcut my hair. My hair is the only thing that binds me to my true self I feel like. If I cut my hair, would I forget about the gender dysmorphia and become a true man? Or will the dysmorphia kill me and I would be even more depressed and would hate myself even more? My friends would like me more that's for sure. But it's not worth it. Maybe it is, I don't know. I don't have the balls to take such a leap anyway.

Next year, I'm going to have an exam. That single exam basically singlehandedly decides which college we will be going to in Turkey. All our lives, bound by 1 single exam. I want to be an artist. I aim for graphic design in a good college here. I won't be able to do it though. The stress started hitting me already. I have only a year, so many people are ahead of me. People who go to courses, have lessons about art. I am here with only my self-made talent. I am supposed to work without sleep on art for an exam a year later. I hate it. I really enjoy drawing, but the whole year will be a nightmare. An older friend of mine. He committed su1cide because of this exam. The pressure was too much for him. (There's no su1cide hotline in Turkey btw, as a side note) My brother took the exam a few years ago. His routine was waking up 6 am, 2 hours of studying, 8 am to 4 pm was school, 4 pm to 8 pm was cram school. 8 pm to 10 pm was studying and he slept after. This was his routine for a WHOLE YEAR. He got into the college he wanted, he also finished grade as the top of the school. I know that I don't have this in me. I can't study this much, even if it's drawing. My father just barely agreed with me after weeks of arguments that he would allow me to go to art school. If I can't get in this year, its over.

I tried self harming today. I grabbed some knife, cut through my thigh. It hurt, there was blood. I felt nothing after it. I don't know what I was expecting. Maybe I just gaslit myself into depression? Whatever, I am not doing that again. I don't know what I'm expecting posting this here. If there is a karma limit its all for nothing anyway. If there isn't , I would most likely get a few responses anyway. I know I wouldn't read through this block of text. Venting feels good sometimes though. I don't know. I don't know what I should do. I have much more to write, but who cares anyway. I don't even care enough to write them down myself. Whatever, even if I don't get replies, it felt good to write this anyway.

"Told my therapist I was suicidal, she told me I should try taking care of a plant","Love my therapist, but don't even know where to begin. I started seeing her earlier this year. She reckons I'm getting better. I personally think I'm getting much worse (and I've been transparent about this). 

Anyways, I told her recently that I feel pretty suicidal. She asks why. I mention that being mentally ill and neurodivergent in a society not made for me makes me wish I was dead. I tell her I've been suicidal for 14 years, with little to no relief. I also mentioned the housing crisis, the planet dying, the crashing economy, the fact that I probably won't be able to retire, and the cold, cruel reality of having to wake up everyday to earn money to provide for a body I hate/keep a roof over my head is my own personal nightmare. I have no aspirations. I hate my life. And I never asked to be born.

My parents would constantly punish me while only ever loving my siblings. They would always scare away any friends I ever had. When I went to college things really started to go downhill. I had a really hard time keeping up academically and only ever made a handful of “friends” my entire time there. I was never really close to any of them we would just occasionally do things together.

suicidal and partner can't deal with me right now,"i'm really struggling with my depression escalating into (relatively active) suicidal ideation rn and my partner is too overwhelmed/shocked after i told her (albeit with super stupid timing on my part) and can't help or deal with it currently. it hurts that sharing my feelings with my partner made everything worse not better but i understand why - we were just having an important difficult conversation and i spiraled out of nowhere which damn my timing is so shitty wow! i just couldnt take it and genuinely felt like i might go through with something but it came across the worst way ever because she initiated the conversation (which was unrelated btw some things that we both mentioned just triggered my suicidality and i couldnt handle it) and even though it wasn't direct cause and effect it will probably make her worried to share things with me in the future. i tried really hard to explain it's not her fault and to distinguish the two things but with timing like that can you blame her for not being sure whether she wants to see me right now? i can't. we were supposed to have a nice sleepover and spend some wholesome time together but i fucked that right up. so i feel superiorly fucking stupid for pulling that one but yeah i have to face this alone for a bit and it's kind of at its worst right now so if anyone has any advice how to not go further with this i'd really appreciate it.

some extra context is that we've been together for almost 3 years but we nearly broke up last week largely due to changes in my behaviour and hurtful things i've done (mostly due to my worsening depression and insecurities) as well as me feeling like she's no longer attracted to me or no longer wanting to be with me in general. i've also officially lost another important friendship of mine within that same week (unrelated, just piling on top of each other). getting out of bed is hard, going to sleep is hard (things i've never had issues with) and i don't see anything that can fix this in the future. i don't talk to anyone except for my partner about my mental health. i don't have friends i can turn to and my family would freak out and make it worse i think. if anyone's experienced this kind of decline please let me know what you did to get through it. i'm fully convinced that i'm a failure and doomed to tragedy for multiple different reasons in every area of my life i can picture and that everyone would be objectively better off without me here. i feel so alone and invisible. i can't help but ruin everything good that comes my way and it feels like nothing will ever change because fundamentally i am the problem, something went really wrong with me at some point and now some mistake in my code makes it so that good things are impossible. every moment when i'm not completely breaking down feels like an ignorant filler moment before i experience pain that has been unimaginable until this point and i'm sick of life torturing me like this, letting me regain false hope when it's just in me to destroy everything. i don't want to cause further pain to anyone and i have pretty debilitating health/death anxiety but my general mental state has gotten so bad i've been watching movie scenes of characters committing suicide to try and exhaust myself into not thinking about it anymore or living it out vicariously which would be unthinkable if i were at my baseline. i selfishly just want to make it through but even all the things i've been excited to experience (some concerts, receiving a cool order i made) don't make me feel anything but shame because i know i don't deserve these experiences. i know i'm probably screaming into the void but it feels like my last resort (there are no suicide hotlines in my country haha), if anyone's experienced this please just tell me your story or share anything that helped you or just anything at all.

I don't think I'm worthy of love it seems ,"I'm kind of done.

I want a family. I want to have kids and live a good life.

But as it stands, I didn't luck out on the gene pool it seems.

Two decades ago I got accused of being a stalker. I took it very personally and hid myself from the world. I didn't understand how or why or what my behavior was at the time so I just counted myself out

I've had some successful relationships since then but  occasionally I find myself in a situation related to that. It's extremely frustrating because a lot of times when I hear about actual sexual assault and other dudes pulling shit I never put my hands on anyone. There are times that I kissed someone but it was consensual and I never initiated it. But I was blamed for it anyway, as if I should have known better.

As of recent, even the bar that I go to where I would think I am welcome treats me as if I am a predator. The best I can do is keep to myself but most of the women who frequent the bar don't say a word to me. 

As much as I try to rationalize it, it hurts a lot. It makes me feel like there is nothing I can do to change this, I just have to accept the fact that I'm a loser and not worthy of offspring. That I have a major flaw of some sort that makes me unlikable.

The best way it seems to interact in this world is to pretend I'm not interested in sex whatsoever. That I don't make any indication benign or otherwise to get to know any woman, even if it's for friendship. I would love nothing more than to have female friends and the like. 

When I do date I feel on the defensive. That I have to accept the leftovers or otherwise emotionally immature people. They have their own issues which are detrimental to my relationship goals, but I'm not supposed to judge. I have to be accepting even if I don't find them all that attractive.

I'm getting better at saying no and having boundaries, but in doing so I feel just as lonely. I recently broke it off with someone because I couldn't stand her lashing out at me at the slightest provocation. I felt as if I was treating her with kid gloves and I couldn't discuss any serious topics. I wanted desperately for it to work and such but I was accused of being a coward for not talking to her. I said I didn't want to be lashed out anymore. 

I don't know what to do. I'm facing the reality that I will die alone without offspring and no one really cares. I don't feel worthy or attractive and anything I do to fix either doesn't solve it. I'm back to being suicidal and I don't know what to do now. I seem to cycle into suicidal thoughts and I wish I could behave my way out of it but I don't know how.",xlebronjames,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e25i1u/i_dont_think_im_worthy_of_love_it_seems/
Passive Ideation?,"I (26F) have struggled with varying intensities of suicidal ideation my entire life. I go through the same phases of depression that I see people talk about here. I’m in therapy and have been for three years and I can say, without a doubt, that it has never been this bad before.

For the first time in my life I feel like there isn’t a single person I can lean on or speak to about how bad things have gotten. I can sense the boredom in my friends’ standard “my life is better with you in it,” responses when, at the urge of my therapist, I’ve gotten real and vulnerable. I know it’s not their responsibility to convince me to live, but I don’t feel supported. I’ve shied away from talking about it because I don’t want anyone to be bored of me. 

I’m harboring insane amounts of guilt for not calling my mom as often as I should. I forgot to wish my stepfather a happy Father’s Day last month, and now I’m afraid to text him. I think everyone is mad at me. I’m mad at me. My sisters (I have four) lean on me for emotional support because I’m the eldest, and I can’t handle it anymore. It’s like the blind leading the blind. 

If I wasn’t so neurotic about the desire to die in the comfort of my apartment, but not wanting to put anyone on the position of finding me dead in the bathtub or whatever, I would do it tonight. I don’t want my therapist to shoulder the weight of thinking she failed. I don’t want my friends to have their weeks ruined by the news. I have a cat, who will take care of her?

It hit me while I was reading this afternoon that I could do it. It’s like being stuck in quick sand and the more I try to crawl out, the more I’m sucked in.

Anyway. I’m wishing you all health and peace and joy. All that sappy shit. ",Glad-Community-3557,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e1xnok/passive_ideation/
My Mental Health ,"Hi, i am a 16 yo (not 16 but will be in 3 months) originally from Pakistan currently living in UAE though last three years I've been not the same person a lot changed I discovered mast*rbating, Po*n, G*re, Shock Videos and many other things I've became mature I've realized that world isn't always about sunshines and rainbows.

When I was 6 my father left for a job and my grandpa died not long before that who was the only person I loved I don't have many friends and only good friends of mine are either long distance or online friends about my father now that we're together I am having very tough time connecting with him even though I hug him often I don't have very good relations with him he's always scolding me because of studies and is always working just Sunday oh his day off he went for work and just like that I couldn't spend time with him.

Ive never been good at studies. I am trying to get closer to good yet I am Unlucky. Ia mtrying to become the best version of myself yet I am unsuccessful. I am trying to be healthy yet I am lazy. I am trying to reduce my screentime yet i am addicted. I am trying to spread positivity yet I am negative myself.

When younger me used to had sucidical thoughts I used to feel pethitic and now the only thing that changed is that I don't feel pethitic.

I don't know why and I know it's not fair to blame him but he said he would call me back and never did, so I waited and before I knew it almost 5 or 6 hours had passed and so I messaged him. He said that he had forgot to call me back and had gone somewhere with his brother, and for some reason my world shattered because I had a feeling he wouldn't call me back, and it came true. It's like I am so used to being disappointed in this world that nothing surprises me anymore and in a strange way I look forward to the next letdown.

God hates me,"I've been having a rough time lately.

Depression is bad. Have been off my meds.


Just a series of bad things one after another. Rejected by women.
Roommates being filthy jackasses.
Car problems.


Today I got rejected for a small studio apartment, I really needed to keep my sanity and focus to try and turn things around.


Then I found out my school classes aren't being paid for because  the Federal Government THINKS they overpaid me in loan money...I don't know how that even works. But they won't give any more aid until I pay the excess back which means I have to pay for classes out of pocket.


Then...to finish off the night. My air cooler (the only thing saving me from being 100% miserable in this heat/humidity wave) leaked water on the floor, and I didn't notice for hours.


During which it soaked 3 boxes of Magic the Gathering cards. Ruining many and damaging more. I lost probably several hundred dollars worth of cards. Now worthless and unplayable.



There is no other explanation.

There is no way I am just THAT unlucky.

No way I just coincidentally have all these bad things happening at once.

No.

There IS a God.

He is a bastard fuck.

He WANTS me to unalive myself.


The kicker?

I have an appointment on Monday with a new Psychatrist to get back on meds.

He is trying to ensure I KMS before that appointment.


I have sweat and cried so much today. 
My chest hurts.


I am broken down.

Anyways she says the difference between them and me is im the one she comes back too. Cause I'm always here for her.

I told her why would I help someone who doesn't even want me around or be together that all she's done is use me. She says I never fucken used you. Then I get her mom and family telling me I'm the one in the wrong that I should be supportive of what she's going through along with some of my family. I long had this feeling of being worthless to point that people are actually repulsed by you she said I made her feel that I was rushing her to take our relationship to the next level we talked for a yr before dating and have dated almost 2 yrs now.

Every day I wake up with an ache in my heart that physically hurts.,"Not a medical thing. It’s like that heavy ache when you lose someone important to you to an unexpected death. It’s that heavy ache that grieves and mourns for what life could have been like, had you not been abused so ruthlessly. It’s that heavy ache when you realize no matter how hard you fight, there are always stronger forces that will eventually tear you down.

Nobody sees your hurt. Nobody sees your struggle. They just look at you like a freak when your CPTSD makes it harder to function in an apathetic society. 

I did not ask to feel emotions so deeply. I did not ask for my neurology to be hyper-aware of the horrors in the world.

It’s getting harder and harder to wade through the mud as it gets thicker and thicker, even after you’d finally built enough muscle to get through how it initially was.

I’m scared of the future. I feel it every day. I have been fighting so hard, working my ass off to afford a basement apartment. I am grateful that I have such a life, but I see the world crumbling. There’s no chance my generation will retire. The planet is becoming uninhabitable. Resources are hoarded and barely distributed. People are being tortured and killed. Human rights are being stripped away slowly but surely.

I'm lost,"I wake up every day, to the same monotonous routine, only to fulfill today's quota of existence... I'm tired man. 

I've tried many different perspectives and approaches to life, and yet still, it seems the more I learn, the more  isolated I feel. 

I understand that I exist and serve a purpose in this world; my loved ones remind me of such; but I can't help but feel a disconnect to this world, man. 

Every waking moment of my life is devoted to deciphering bullshit theories that I come up with in my head, and in a weird way, I adore that practice, but I'm growing tired.

We have undoubtedly entered a new era, especially regarding Internet culture and the status quo at large; and yet I feel so alone; even at a time time where I can and should connect with unlimited people... I try to integrate myself into the 'new norm', but its almost like a mask; a mask to lessen my worries; as I palm the blame to substance or stature; trying to comb existence out of a disorganised mesh.

When I wake, I think as death as an escape. As I sleep, the same rhetoric takes hold within my dreams; it's ingrained, almost instinctual; I'm scared. 

I don't know what to do...

I'm not writing this for sympathy and advice, I simply want to resonate with people who feel the same way. That emotion or instinct that life doesn't feel right for us. 

I remember hearing a quote (paraphrasing to the max) ""You don't want to die, you want this version of you to die"". No other explanation I can think of, can encapsulate that emotion. I don't want to die. I love life, I love living; I just don't know how long I can keep going in this current climate.

Suicidal Boyfriend Wants to Kill Himself,"My boyfriend M/30, and I F/28 have been together for 7 years. We both had great careers going for ourselves, bought a townhome together, have two cats, and have a good group of friends. My boyfriend's job ended on bad terms last year, and ever since this led to him making destructive decisions. He joined the military briefly, but attempted suicide which caused him to be hospitalized and discharged from the military. He then attempted a second time after he spent 1-2 months home, and thankfully has not been harmed from either attempts. He was then diagnosed with depression and bipolar. 

Ever since the beginning of this year, he has really been struggling with thoughts of suicide. The first half of this year he battled these thoughts, but I would say the past 2 months or so, he has just become pro-suicide. He thinks he should have the right to end his life and not partake in this game of life where he just hustles to work for the rest of his life. He finds that there's no reason for him to be here, and that there's no meaning to life. He has a nihilistic approach now, and expresses how much he wants to kill himself. 

He has been hospitalized before, but it honestly was not a good or helpful experience. He threatens that if he were to be sent to the hospital again, he would leave all of us so that he can go somewhere far away to just end it all. We're afraid of calling the hospital on him during times he expresses the darkest of his thoughts / his intent to end his life because he sounds very willing to follow through with his plan of leaving us all and doing it if we were to do that to him. At the end of the day, we concluded we will not call the hospital on him as we know it can be a dehumanizing experience, and from our experience last time, he never really got the help he really needed while he was there. I think the first hospitalization may have contributed to his suicidality a little further due to the humiliation of it. 

Currently he is seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, but they are both being changed now due to a lack of connection with them. I am getting him to see a couples therapist with me and aim to try to involve him in some support groups as the next step. He also stopped taking medication due to the ways it made him gain weight / didn't feel like it was helping. We workout together and go on walks together, which are things I feel like help even just a little bit. 

My struggle is that he is upset with us for trying to hold him back from ending his life. He expresses anger in us just not letting him do that, and has become pro-suicide ever since. He's not someone who has struggled with mental illness his whole life, it really only emerged in the past year, and I feel like he is not giving a new future for himself a chance. The pain of having to just get through the ""grind"" of life is something he doesn't want to do.

There are times I can feel he is in limbo about his decisions, but when we have conversations he just full on states that he would like to die. I try to just be there to listen, validate, give him the space to talk about it even when it's painful for me to hear about his wishes. I don't tell him that I agree with him though. I try to take it as a positive that he is even talking and sharing his suicidal thoughts, because before he didn't. 

While he has suicidal thoughts and possibly intent, as far as I'm aware, he doesn't have the means or detailed plan right now which makes me feel like as long as I can monitor his physical safety (we live together and spend the majority of our days together), he should be safe. The hospital is definitely not off the table, and we would still pull it if need be. However, I'm really struggling to find ways to help shift his perspective about ending his life. More therapy? Meds? Psychedelics? If there was something that has helped you or a loved one have this mindset shift, please let me know.

Got kicked out. It's all my fault. (edge lord gets reality checked),"I got kicked out of a discord group for acting inappropriately, but I know it's all my fault.

It all happened when I got into a heated debate with one of the mods about my behaviors, they unanimously decided to kicked me out, not wanting to deal with me any more. Then everyone in the group unceremoniously cut me off on all platforms afterwards.

Honestly though I really can't blame them. Looking back I was pretty unhinged in the chats (more tactless  than toxic at least according to those mods), and evidently I got on the nerves of many people on the server.  
I want to go back and say sorry to everyone on that server, but the time has past, they won't be hearing from me anymore. And I doubt they'll accept my apology, no matter how sincere it is.  
The thing is I am a total loner outside of that specific group, a social outcast even when living online. I identify with the quite kid who you would wonder if my back pack has something that shouldn't be brought to school.

After being a loner for so long I thought I finally find a place of acceptance in that group, and it turns out they were just being nice and biding their time(at least that's what I felt like) to get rid of me.  
and they. Were such cool people, always with amazing projects and personal stories to share, and at least some of them seems to accept me. But now it's all gone.

I feel like I am constantly rejected for being who I am, but deep down I know I myself have some disturbing  problems to fix before going back to normal society or at the very least to put on a proper mask to hide my more unhinged side.

At the same time I don't feel like I have the strength to continue anymore, I always feel that way after high school, got fired from a good job for being myself, and now after this I feel like I can never change any more.

The only reason why I am not doing preparing for you know what is because if I do, it will ruin my family's future financial prospect(no details here). but that's no longer a powerful enough excuse for me to go on anymore.

I really want to change a better person, be more productive and more attentive to my surroundings, most importantly more attune to the feelings of others, acquire better Communication skills so the same thing won't happen again because of my actions. (I have autism)

And I'm sick of being told ""Sometimes you have to do things you don't like"" it's never JUST sometimes.. It's ALL the time.. And I can never pin point exactly what.. I just want to die..

i have no one..,"i just need to be heard and maybe know if anyone has ever felt this way?
since i was 16 i knew i was depressed. was taken as a “sad teenager” but over the years was prescribed different medications, saw different therapists etc. 

Few random things that played roles to me:
* i had the best, most treasurable person you could have as a friend by my side. ik everyone says that about their best friend…. but since 15, the funniest, most considerate person; attached at the hip. never understood anxiety or depression but she hung on with me (after a few years, i wouldn’t really talk about it much anymore cause i felt like i was bothering her, even tho ik i wasn’t.)
randomly through High school…. i’d go through phases where i’d stop talking to people to isolate myself but her and i would always reconnect after a week and i never made it “out of our friendship” (i was so grateful for that, i never knew why i had that urge so often….)
* skipping ahead to the age of 26… i became way too much, my depression and internal anxiety i practically let control me (still do), isolated myself for over a year. i lost her for good that time and now someone else is her best friend…. i deserved that. i lost my other platonic soulmate this way, too. i turned into a miserable bitch and i just hated myself so much. 

*the absolute love of my life…. my best friend in the relationship… except, he was a chronic cheater…. we dated from 20-25 and i STILL can’t stop wanting the representative of him, as my partner. i can’t let it go, i haven’t gone back or talked to him either. but i haven’t dated or been interested in anyone since. idk how to date or even make friends anymore. 

i really did let things simmer in my mind all my life and let them run me. i’ve always felt marginalized, always felt in the shadows, always molded myself to someone else. always felt like i didn’t belong or that i was a last minute pathetic invite. unwanted, unloved. unnecessary, undeserving. but i wanted to enjoy and love life again. 

There’s a lot that I really do wanna say because it matters to the connection, but I really want to explain the suffering now. 98% of my day I spend trying to figure out how to enjoy a piece of life, and how to talk myself out of suicide. W connection, but I really want to explain the suffering now. 98% of my day I spend trying to figure out how to enjoy a piece of life, and how to talk myself out of suicide. The will to die severely outweighs my will to live, it even has when I was “happy“. The last therapist I saw was for two years, and I left because she basically said she let her clients talk themselves into their solution. Hate that. My psychiatrist, in a nutshell, said “you’re too young and pretty to have the problems you’re describing “. Dehumanizing doesn’t even scratch the surface. 

truly, I live for my cat. And my grandma. Other than that, I only feel love when I’m sleeping and dreaming. This isn’t life anymore, I don’t enjoy being awake. That makes me so sad. It’s not fair. I have to keep myself here for everybody else . I’m even on the best medicine regimen I’ve ever had, and I still feel this way.

I will be 32 at the end of this month. I’ve been in isolation for almost 2 years and I feel like my life ended half my life ago. I cry every single day and I’m so tired of living. I miss a life that I’ll never have again, and it’s like I can’t accept it. I would truly sign off on a lobotomy if it was offered.

"You think once it’s over you’ll feel good, and it’s never like that.","I used to think once the trauma itself was over, once I understood what happened and healed my situation from the outside, I’d feel better. 
The truth is I don’t. I am suffering the sequels of what I went through in the past and I feel the loneliest I’ve ever felt. I hadn’t realized how much this interferes with my daily life until now. People have started to notice my ticks. I have scars on my fingers because I bite them when I’m anxious, and the worse part is I feel extremely unlovable. 

I don’t think I’d be fair for anyone to deal with all of this that is me. It’s not that I don’t acknowledge I have good attributes as well. We all do. 
I just think my good qualities aren’t enough to compensate for the rest. No one is ever gonna want to be with someone who is average at most but is this broken.
My best friend tries to remind me I’m not my trauma and i shouldn’t let my past define me; however it’s hella hard when I see it’s echoes coming through every single interaction; every single mistake.
My therapist says the simple fact I talk about sometime graduating college, or about having passions means I don’t actually mean it when I say I wanna die. 
I guess she’s right. It’s not that I wanna kill myself. I’m just tired of fighting. Fighting to be better at what I do, and prettier, and nicer with people, and wiser, and skinnier, and better skilled, smarter and to do things better. It’s never enough to compensate how dreadfully useless and unworthy I am.

I COULDN’T SAY TWO WORDS ALOUD,"I recently just started summer school and it's been going by pretty smoothly.

I gave it back to them and they apologized but then my dumbass told them ‘It’s fine’ in the lowest voice possible.

Before I could say it louder though, another classmate of mine told them that I don’t talk, and before I could defend myself, they already moved on to another topic.

And the worst part about it is that I could’ve avoided it if I had just spoken up. I'm so mad at myself, even as I type this at home. That was such a simple interaction and I still managed to fuck it up. Not only that, it was a chance for me to socialize with my fellow classmates. 

I’m just gonna kill myself. There’s no way in hell I can ever get better if I can't do something as simple as saying TWO words aloud. TWO.

Ready to be done ,"I don’t want to be lectured or told that my life is worth it because I don’t feel like it is. My life is a joke. Always have been, always will be. People have always walked over me and that created self esteem issues and insecurity issues, as well as trauma and ptsd. I have diagnosed ocd and bpd, I’m never good enough for my family, they always gaslight me even when they claim they don’t and it makes me feel like I’m the crazy, dramatic one… I’ve been a punching bag for most people my entire life and I’m too empathetic and I’m just done. Now I’m 29, almost 30 and like everyone else, I’m struggling financially and I am so desperately unhappy. I have a bachelors degree but of course that was a waste and now I’m paying my student loan every month and if I don’t pay it, my mom will start bitching my ear off because “she co-signed and they’ll come after her and ruin her credit” even though I genuinely am doing my best to pay stuff.

"Mental Health Patient, help needed ASAP","Hello, I have a family member who suffers from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Currently, he is staying with us because he is unable to live independently.

He has faced crises in the past, but admitting him to a mental health facility has been challenging because he presents as completely normal when speaking with healthcare providers. Even when we showed videos of him expressing that he wanted to unalive someone. 

After researching options, I'm considering having him sign a Power of Attorney (POA) or a Psychiatric Advance Directive.

I would greatly appreciate any advice on what steps to take, especially as his behavior is becoming increasingly aggressive.

What now,"I sat in the car and put a tube connecting the exhaust near my face. I heard it was painless but I felt light headed and short of breath after an hour and panicked out of it. Idk if I'm even doing it right. That was my only painless way I could think of. I guess I really can't go through with it. I'll probably try again randomly till I succeed. 

I'm just a lazy almost 30yo bum. Never had a job. And don't attempt to go to most of the interviews. Dropped out of college for being lazy. I'm always be lazy. I can't handle stress well. I run out of cars or try to grab fish out of fish tanks. It's ridiculous. I deserve to die.

Sometimes I wish I could turn back time and complete college maybe even take an ""easier"" course. Or maybe go straight into a job. But even with what I know now, I might end up doing the same thing. 

What would you do in my situation? If I can't handle baby amounts of stress from ppl saying ""you need to get your life together soon"" (which I agree with, I just still get upset) how can I handle a job? I'm slow and overthink so much about negative, true things. 

How can I discipline myself and stay on track. How can I know I can stay on track. How can I do it if I knowing everyone else has more experience than I'll ever have. 

I know I'll never not be pathetic, but I really need a job to get out of my parent's hair.  I tried to do CNA (A SIMPLE 3 WEEK COURSE) and I couldn't even commit to that (I didn't show up for the first day and woke up late). I'm addicted to running away. 

Be honest with me.

Should I just be homeless to not be a burden to my parents. They're financially stable right now, but my mom swore to not retire until I get my life together. And I do want her to retire asap.

I haven't never been loved someone before and I don't think that someone will love me. I don't exactly know what is my problem. Why can't I be good enough? Guess I am not good enough for relationship. I don't have friends too. I used to have a good friend group but it fell apart. Everyone had jobs, girlfriends, school etc. They moved another cities. Since that I am socially wreck. I couldn't find anyone else except some online friends. For last two days I was feeling a pain in my chest, I crave for a hug everynight. Nobody says me good morning. Nobody cares about me. It was all my fault I guess. I will die alone so why do I keep living for? I will never know what is true love or how does it feel to have someone who really loves you. I tried to have a relationship and It didn't work out. I am too bad for anyone and I don't deserve love.  
I ran out of reasons to live and since I don't  have anyone to talk I am here. I would do everything for a geniune hug or someone to say me that everything will be allright. I don't deserve this.

I’m too embarrassed to talk about being suicidal,"In 29, I feel like I should have my life together. I have credit card debt that I dug myself into after a year of being reckless and trying to find vices to make me feel happy.

I find myself caught in constant daydreams of taking my pills and a bottle of wine and just overdosing by the favourite spot at the ocean. Just to be done. I’m so tired. I want to do it soon but I keep stopping myself. 

I guess I just wonder what the point is. Why would I stay here when I keep self sabotaging myself and making it worse before it can get better? Even with things to look forward to, if there are going to be reoccurring bad times like this, what’s the point in staying? I don’t want to feel like a burden or a mess anymore.

Trying repeatedly with no real results ,"Hi I have been on this Reddit for years now, some under different accounts but I’ve basically been submitting shit here since I was 15-21. Every attempt has not been successful (obviously) and it is too much. I am always thinking and searching for new ways to end shit and I just don’t have access to it or even the strength to finish things off. I’ve gotten close, don’t get me wrong, but I crawled to find help and was met with a nice long hospital stay. I have an alphabet soup of disorders that make my life genuinely so unbearable, and I’m expected to just “get better” lol. I have been in therapy for a while but nothing changes and after every relapse it’s just another disappointment, to myself and others. As I’m writing this, I’ve cut vertically over and over again but I just can’t seem to cut deep enough. I only hit the white weird part and I don’t know what’s holding me back. I shake and cry and shiver, I think of the things my abusive partner says to me, what my family did and thinks of me, of everything that’s wrong with me and even though I feel and remember those things, nothing can tip me over the edge enough to finish the job. Why do I stick around? Is it the innate instinct to survive even if I don’t want to? I don’t know. But my arm stings and I want to do it. I just want to see everything pour out and be satisfied knowing no one will miss me. I just want to finally know I won’t burden anyone else or the world with my presence. I contribute nothing, am disabled, I’m not allowed to do anything, I cannot fend for myself and I forget constantly. I have zero independence. Does it really matter? I am nothing but a stain and nothing can ever change my mind. Tonight, I pissed off my partner because I added my friend on steam to gift her a $2 dollar game. Bad choice. He is upset with me greatly and our relationship will never be the same after this. What do I do? I tried communicating, I tried comforting, I tried to physically be there but nothing works because I ruin everything and make terrible decisions. Nothing I ever do is right, to my partner, to my family, to anyone around me. I just sort of exist? Not really. I hide for months on end, don’t talk to anyone in fear of upsetting my partner and because people scare the fuck out of me. I have no quality of life, I take Benadryl just to put myself to sleep in order to avoid fights with my partner, to practice being dead, and for insomnia. I can’t afford good healthcare, I can’t afford anything, except maybe the $2 game for my one friend whom I rarely ever talk to but I figured it would be a nice gesture since she found the game cool and didn’t have it yet. Okay well now I’m just ranting but I don’t have a single soul I can talk to, I can’t bombard my one friend with this, I can’t talk to my partner, I can’t do anything besides plan my suicide because it’s the only right thing for me to do. I kind of just wish someone could say the right horrible things to me to get me to do it. There’s nothing left for me in this world, it doesn’t matter for me, I’ll never be worth it. I’m sorry.

I don't want to see my birthday,My birthday is on Wednesday next week and I don't want to see it. I feel like I should go out on Sunday to the middle of the desert. Just me and one shell. The problem is I can't do that to my family and my friends and her and the kids. Before anyone asks no we weren't married we were just dating long-term. I don't know how I am supposed to continue on. Things are not good. My brain is not good. I don't want to go in psychiatric hold. I've tried calling crisis lines and they ignore me. It feels like all they want to do is get you off the line after an hour. They all read from the same script. I wish I could have someone reach out to her for me. But that's a cowards move. I wish I could call her myself. But she made it clear she doesn't want to talk to me right now.

Why do people act like not doing this is common sense?,"I'm in a depression support group, and the leader got mad at a member for saying he thought a coping skills he was proposing was stupid.  The leader said something like, ""If I didn't want to try anything, there'd be no reason to have a group.  Why not just die at that point?""

I don't remember the exact wording, but basically he implied suicide is stupid and we should keep fighting however we can.  The guy's like 50 and says he's still trying new meds and coping skills, hoping something will make his life worth living. 

And I just don't understand why people think that way.  Why is living inherently better than dying if you consistently are unhappy you're alive?  

I've thought of asking him, but I'd feel kind of guilty if I accidentally convinced him.  He also might just get mad and kick me out if he truly is being irrational like I think.  People without a logical argument tend to just go nuclear. 

Like, I hate to ask it, but I don't understand his logic.  What's his thought process here?  He just acts like it's laughable, case closed, no need for consideration.  ",Terrible-Trust-5578,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1e1qz44/why_do_people_act_like_not_doing_this_is_common/
i DONT hate myself. i HAVE caring friends. it STILL doesnt get better,"im unlike most of you, and suicide is still my only option. im just too depressed to help myself.

what are the friends gonna do? they all just tell me ""oh, i feel sorry for you"", ""oh, i hope it gets better"". absolutely pointless. they rarely come visit me. they have their own issues, theyre busy, AND no one enjoys hanging out with someone who is sick of life and people. and im too depressed to go out and visit them. 

i have gone out to meet people more than most people ive met who are in the same situation. i did not find any better friends because those are extremely rare, and im tired of looking. no, its not ""just try once more, you will never know"". i heard that a decade ago. those words mean nothing to me anymore. just keep repeating it and take all the meaning out of it. thats not going to help. no one can help me. i cant help myself. suicide is my only option.

Might order a few supplies ,"I’m 28m, since I was 19, I have been dealing with an illness that has affected every area of my life. I have missed out on having a good career, graduating college on time, grad school, a house or apartment, a car, and what I care about most, a wife. I’m a virgin, I feel it’s not my fault because of the illness. I don’t want to lose to it in a random fling, I want to lose it to a woman I love a lot. It just sucks all of these great things haven’t happened for me because of something I had no control over. Whenever I think about that, I can’t help but feel absolutely heartbroken. 

These last 9 years have gone by super quickly for me. I still dream about my high school graduation, about how happy I was for my future… I never would have guessed in a million years I would be so miserable. My physical symptoms seem to have gotten worse, whenever I have symptoms, it’s actually traumatizing. It makes my heart rate spike up as if I’m having a heart attack, yet I never die… I just sit there suffering and praying. I don’t want to live when I’m literally being traumatized every so often. 

I still feel like I want to live… I’m just tired of suffering. I might order supplies for my suicide method. I want to live but I’m literally in agony
