###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

I was raped when I was 8 years old. I feel like after that my childhood was over. I don’t know why it still affects me now. It’s been more than half of my life. 

Whenever I see or hear things to do with my life before then I cry. I was so happy when I was a small child. 

I wish things could be that way again. If I was never raped my life would be so different. I wouldn’t be suicidal like I am now. I wouldn’t have grown up so fast. I would be happy. I would probably not have as bad mental health issues. My whole life could have been different. 

I wouldn’t still be having nightmares years later. Unable to keep long lasting friendships and relationships. Depending on drugs and alcohol so I don’t kill myself.

I know I wouldn’t still be laughing and playing barbies and dress up now but I would’ve naturally. Instead of for some reason just stopping after the trauma. 

I want to be that girl again. I don’t want to be an adult. I just want to be 7 years old again before my life was ruined. I want to play all day and watch Peppa pig with my sister who didn’t understand why I wouldn’t play with her anymore at the time. And I want to collect my little pony figures and draw with wash off glitter tattoo pens with my friends. Before they started to turn on me and bully me because I started to become weird after the trauma.

I never would’ve thought I’d turn out this way. No one did. I used to be kind and friendly and have morals. Now I steal all the time and have to be on something to cope all the time and I’m mean to people I care about all the time.

After that, the UA vs RU happened and I think it's destroyed my mind completely. I wasn't able to think about anything else busides the war that is happening near my country border.
About 1 to 1.5 year later I was able to function normally like with the virus, but the war thing was a way worse. 
I was wiking up in the middle of the night hearing the freaking tanks or air raid siren (it was in my head only), I had to took some sleeping pills to be able to sleep over 6 hours.

And now, after my dog died - everything came back to me. Now I'm even afraid of freaking thunders (I was never afraid of them).

I'm paranoid almost about everything.
I was talking with psychologist 2 or 3 days after my dog died, she just told me that I'm a strong person and I just need some time.

Almost a month ago, everything is still very hard for me, sometimes even harder than after the sad news.

I don't really know what I should do, I have ultra mixed feelings - but I don't feel the happiness as I use to felt it before everything.

If someone had similar experience, please help me because I'm really loosing my mind ;(",t2_14mm92zodp,False,,0,False,Please help me,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e4bldi,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,False,,False,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1721091611.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost a month ago I lost my childhood 13 years old dog, and after that everything came back to me &amp;lt;- this is a very important thing to see the world fromy my side&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hello everyone,

I've never used the internet this way, but today I hope it will be beneficial because I really feel that I need it. Let's start...

I am a young man, an only child, who recently turned 20. I lived with my father and mother until I was 19, but one day my mother left home for another man. This affected me greatly because we were a very close-knit family of three, and it affected my father even more. Today, it's almost been five months since I found my father deceased by suicide. That day, he left me a letter that I will simplify: he told me that he adored me and that I couldn't even imagine how much, and that he was very proud of me. He then told me to never stop, to continue and reach my dreams, and that he would always be there with me, anywhere, anytime, he would accompany me. But he also said something: he was sorry for not being the father I would have wanted. Yet he knew very well how proud I was of him and how much I loved him. He was the center of my universe. But knowing my father, he always wanted more for his family and convinced himself that he wasn't good for me. But if he knew how perfect he was in my eyes...

Today, I live with my uncle (my father's brother) and my cousins. Why am I not with my mother? Because everything happened so quickly: my mother, the loss of my father... It wasn't the right time for me to live with her and her new man. And recently, I learned from a reliable source that she had cheated on my father before leaving him, so I am very confused with everything I'm going through. I know that time will heal things, but time moves forward for me and no longer for my father, and that enrages me.

Now, the real reason for this post is that I too am now thinking about ending this life of suffering. There's not a day that goes by without me thinking about it. Currently, I only continue for my father, my family, and my friends... but what about me in all this? When I sit down and take two minutes, I really struggle to see the beauty in this life. Yes, I have dreams and ambitions, but it seems like nothing makes sense anymore, everything tastes nostalgic... I've thought of ways to end it and the places, but only in thought, so I haven't taken any actions yet, but I feel it could happen... I want to live, but I have such a bitter taste from my experience on this earth now. When I argue, for example with my uncle, even over simple things, I automatically think: what's the point in continuing? I realize that I'm really staying here for my loved ones. I could probably write to you endlessly, but I'll stop here for now. It did me good to write this.

,SuicideWatch,"This year has been the worst year for me. I had to leave the city that I loved, along with the community and friends I had, and move back home due to visa issues and my parents' health. I’m now faced with the possibility of changing careers (I worked in film) to support my wife and child, as it's not stable or lucrative here. This might mean abandoning my dream of becoming a film director due to external pressures( i come from a conservative community so film is looked down upon), and I’ve been feeling like a failure seeing all my old friends and relatives in higher positions while I struggle to stay financially afloat every day.

I thought this would be the year I finally made the film I worked so hard to write and assemble a team for (I've been pretending that I’m doing well and have just been focused on my film this year). However, it’s been impossible to juggle my dreams with having a family, addressing my parents' needs, finishing our house repairs, finding a potential job to make money, working on my film, and dealing with other personal emotional problems. 

This year, everything has fallen apart, and it has felt like a battle. Nothing has been simple, and I’m tired. I tried following my dreams, but I’m starting to doubt my abilities and whether I’ll ever reach where I want to be in life or be able to give my family the life they deserve. Maybe I’m too old to make it; maybe I missed my chance. 

I imagine life would be easier if my wife had married someone else and not me, a failed artist, or if I died so they could move on without needing to support me and my unrealistic dreams and expectations in life, maybe i’m just another failed dreamer that wasn’t tough enough to go all they way or able to sacrifice to make his dreams real because i’m weak... it doesn’t matter anymore i just want to kill all my ambitions, goals and dreams so i make life easier for myself and everyone around me.

,SuicideWatch,"Harsh truths. Gentle truths. I need either at this point.

I have suicide plan ideas, no solid plan yet. I want to die. Hanging did not work back when I was 19, so don't wanna try that. OD is extremely difficult to do, I'm more likely to just get hospitalized for that. I do not like gore so don't want to expose that to someone by shooting myself with my step dads gun or jump off a cliff. On my list is either charcoal burning, jumping into a cold lake hoping for hypothermia/cold water drowning, or purposeful heat stroke (I'm a runner; I imagine this would be easy to do just not pleasant to experience). I know the biggest challenge is my body's natural desire to live, unfortunately.

At the same time I don't know if I am actually going to go through with it. Maybe I wrote out the plans as a coping mechanism - to know it is there in case things hit the fan more than they already have, such as my mom dying from cancer/complications of cancer.

I'm on vacation, without any actual plans. I'm just bopping around. Even on vacation I am painfully depressed. This isn't like me, I usually find adventure and fun in the smallest things and find great joy in the spontaneous and I romanticize the shit about everything and anything.

The other night, I could actually feel the emotional pain where I did not want to breathe anymore.

Some background about me: I have depression/anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD. I also have a clinical doctorate and do not dislike my job, but I'm also in 200k+ debt that will be forgiven if I die. I have been feeling quite isolated in the small town I've been in since last fall. My mom got diagnosed with late stage cancer and while she made it through chemo and radiation, she has been having toxic side effects from immunotherapy and recurrent respiratory failure episodes in which she has had 6 hospital admissions in the last month alone. I am not close to my dad or step dad. I feel lonely and I have no close friends. I'm scared of living a life without my mom. Without my aging cat. Without anyone. Life looks bleak. I'm tired of being the funny person and the one that looks out for people, but all alone once I'm at home. Silence is no longer comforting, but neither is music anymore. Nothing soothes the ache.

I do not enjoy what I usually do. I want to force myself to go out and trail run and boulder, things I love but I just do not anymore. I know these are textbook symptoms of depression. I have the logic to identify what is going on, but that does not make me feel better emotionally. I love the moon and sunsets and now when I look at them, I feel nothing. I have no interest in anything in life.

Yes this is a post for ""attention"" because I want to spend the next hour reading advice or insights to keep me distracted, genuinely. I have nothing else going on.

,SuicideWatch,"I feel like I’m constantly doing what I feel like a normal human should be doing. I consume so much social media and watch so much tv that idk what’s real and what’s a performance anymore. What is performative friendship and what’s real anyway? I feel truly like it’s all a performance like I genuinely feel like a character in a show trying to keep everyone entertained. I know I should have friends and a partner and I should keep trying to be presentable but everything just feels like this huge chore and I’m constantly trying to pretend it isn’t. I think art and life is one and the same because some people find joy in the act while for others the artificial nature of it makes it unenjoyable. I don’t have fun pretending people’s up and down behavior is amusing and generally people are more aggravating than anything. I find people exhausting because of how unpredictable they are. I can’t just be me because of course I get what it’s like on the receiving end and for that reason alone I must be kind.

I must constantly set aside my own needs and respond to people even though I find it utterly boring. I think to have any sort of amusement in life you have to be somewhat selfish. The happiest people I met were complete assholes who put themselves above everything. An ex friend of mine would never consider suicide and had so much love for life she couldn’t have it in her to have empathy for someone who doesn’t. It must be easy for someone like her who forgives and forgets so easily and steps all over the things I enjoy. She showed little interest in what I enjoyed and had the nerve to say that I HAD THE POWER in the friendship. 

I had the power yet I constantly bent myself backwards trying to be a good friend showing interest in what she liked yet she treated me like a complete ghost and I was just another person for her to collect. This is how optimistic people are, they think miserable people are a burden and the mere presence of unhappiness is a threat on their wellbeing. Me just being my true authentic self is a threat on people and they feel uncomfortable. They think I’m stupid for caring about the wellness of human beings and society. They think I’m weak for watching the news and being personally emotionally affected by things. Feeling sadness at the plight of others is seen as a weakness. I genuinely can’t live in a world where everyone is trying to get ahead by acting on their own selfish needs.

True empathy is extremely hard to come by and people who seemed like they had good intentions hurt me. They still act on their selfish desires and don’t care whether it’s what’s good or not. It’s like every waking moment I’m questioning everything I consume. The idea of being rich is enticing until I see how every rich person is out of touch to a certain degree. They try to be good people yet they participate in the exact thing that makes people hurt. You can’t exactly bend yourself for other’s needs but at the same time these people should quit pretending to be altruistic when in actuality they’re apart of the same competitive system as the rest of us. 

A true selfless act would be not participating in most things. It seems like no matter what I do I’m inadvertently hurting someone. I think I should just take the burden away from everyone by ending it all. Being human is being selfish inherently.

I've (unsuccessfully) gone through training via an outpatient program to learn DBT skills, I've restarted my ADHD meds (which help with my impulsive behavior, but not nearly enough), I've been seeing a therapist for about half a year now to no real effect, and I've continued to spiral, withdraw, self-harm, and drag everyone around me through completely insane emotional outbursts.

I don't feel self-righteous or justified in any way afterwards, though, the way people seem to talk about it. I feel exhausted and deeply embarrassed, because looking back, I can see how completely irrational I was being to the point that my own behavior doesn't seem to make sense at all. It just makes me want to crawl into a hole and disappear, because how the fuck could anyone tolerate that more than once? What makes a person like that worth the effort?

Everyone around me is trying their hardest, but my outbursts and meltdowns are constant, sometimes more than once a week, and none of the grounding techniques I learned in outpatient work very well.

I feel like a burden, persistently.

When I try to look up advice, information, or self-help, I'm just bombarded with horror stories about people's abusive relationships at the hand of someone with BPD, that people like me should simply be abandoned, how I'm doomed to suffer for the rest of my life, how I'll never be happy with anything and I simply cannot be fixed.

My therapist and my current psychiatrist tell me that what I have is actually CPTSD, and that BPD isn't a ""real"" diagnosis, and yet it's right there on my psych eval from my last psychiatrist, permanently affixed to my mental health record, and even they tell me that it's not something that'll ever be fixed, that I just have to learn to cope and manage it.

I'm sitting in a voice call right now feeling irritated by everyone speaking, wanting to lash out irrationally, but even if I leave it'll set people off, and that if I leave, I'm going to progressively cut myself off until someone comes to retrieve me. I can fucking hear it already, ""There she goes again, she's doing it again,"" I can hear the sighs and the exasperation, I can feel my best friend's blood pressure rising.

I just can't stand this anymore. I'm not happy. I'm never happy. I feel like a fucking curse on everyone in my life and I care too much about them to keep subjecting them to this bullshit. I can't even make new friends, I just drive them off or else they abandon me or lose interest, which is fair, given I'm not very interesting, so it's like there's just this slow trickle of everyone away from me, like I'm bleeding out, and I can't stand this persistent feeling of isolation and misery anymore.",t2_gg4o9o77,False,,0,False,I was diagnosed with BPD this year.

,SuicideWatch,I know it will be terrible for them either way. But I need advice on how to make it a little better. Maybe isolating myself first?

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 22(M), and I'm in my final year in some university in Nigeria. Recently, I've been having some thoughts of ending my life. It's crazy, because this is the first time I'm saying this out loud lol. I guess I have never said it out loud because I wish it wasn't true, plus I think the reason why I'm having these thoughts is pretty much stupid in the grand scheme of things. It may sound dumb, but the reason I've been having these thoughts is because I may end up not graduating this year, and my energy for school is nonexistent. I never really liked school from day one. And I live in a society that bases your worth majorly on your academic achievements and then financial status. The moment I stepped into this university, I have been dreaming about leaving or dropping out. I study Engineering, and the programme typically spans 5 years, and I always thought that before the 5 years would be up, I'd hit jackpot in my career as a frontend developer and drop out.
I think the major reason why not graduating this year and having an extra year is such a big deal is because of the pressures I experience. Growing up, I had always been the intelligent one and people tend to have high expectations of me because they regard me as intelligent, and those expectations typically involves doing well in the university. But, I just... can't. I hate this school. I don't like being around these people. Every morning I wake up here, it always feels like I'm being strangled. I hate going to classes, I hate writing exams, I hate all of it. And I've never been open about this because I'm afraid of judgement.  Heck, even as I type this I'm judging myself. But feeling this way about school, and then having to stay an extra year?! It feels impossible. I don't think I can do it. And then opening up to my parents and siblings about my academic failures feels like a hurdle that I cannot possibly cross. Especially my parents. Their expectations of me are too high, and they care about me a lot, and I would hate to disappoint them. My parents are not the progressive sort at all. I know for a fact that they won't take it well. They definitely won't. And I'd hate to make them sad, but I can't avoid it at this point. Everything just feels overwhelming right now.

Warning: this post includes loads of triggers, please don’t read if it’ll hurt you. 
I apologise in advance; it’s quite long I thought I should provide context.!

So I (27F), just been told I’m the toxic one in my family. My little brother (19M) got tired of my shit and called me on it. I didn’t know. It was 3h ago, I’m having a breakdown/existential crisis/ realisation overload. 
It’s horrible. I don’t know what to do with myself. I called the suicide helpline. 
For a bit of context: I have several chronic illnesses, all of them quite painful, for the past 7 years. Monthly trips to the A&amp;E, daily hormones/painkillers/antidepressants, weekly appointments to Specialists Dr. It’s quite hard because I tried going to University and had to stop because of the pain, tried working and pain stopped me again , I can’t even be a reliable volunteer. I used to play the cello, and do ballet, and paint and draw, and read a lot, but the pain shakes and the medication makes it too hard now ( kids’Paint by number are too hard for me). 
On top of those chronic illnesses; I have to battle PTSD for multiple rapes, a psychologically abusive ex, medical malpractices, absent father, school bullying ( from preK to A levels), being sterile and daily pain. 
Not a surprise if I tell you I am depressed. 
And I thought the best thing to do was to just deal with all of that myself, to prove them I was independent and strong. Not to burden them because they already had their problems to deal with. 
But no. My brother in law gifted my sister a “how to deal with narcissists” book and I just realised it was about me. 
I had to move in with my mom ( parents going through a separation right now), because I wasn’t able to take care of myself on a daily basis (like food and showers and cleaning and groceries ect were too much). 
And I’ve been treating her like shit. I would be on the streets without her. 
And I thought I had the behaviour that conveyed my gratitude. That’s the worse part, it wasn’t on purpose. The pain gave me tunnel vision and I was so focused on one meal at a time, one step at a time.
They know me so badly they gifted me shelves for my birthday, and did party food ( crisps and mini toasts), because they don’t know my favourite foods. 
I thought I was masking my daily bad moods ( very hard to be happy when your one and unique thought is PAIN), but they were suffering. 
I treated my mum like a slave, I didn’t even say good mornings or thanks to all the chores she did for me. 
I knew I did something bad because she’s been retreating herself from me, leaving me to deal alone with my mess. 
3 days ago I had a flare up so bad I was immobilised and crying /yelling in pain for several hours. The neighbours got worried and called the cops and ambulance. They took me to the hospital and kept me for 3days to ran tests and control the pain. Apparently they came ( mum and brother)to my room and knocked to check up on me and I didn’t hear them. Now, my mum is angry at me because she was ashamed of having to deal with the cops.
A part of me is tired to be made the bad guy every time. If I go to my room to deal with my pain ( like at Christmas), I’m sulking and ignoring everyone. My mum says « to not check for non intentional consequences/ accidents of your actions, is doing it on purpose », basically if you cared you would have thought ahead if it would hurt anyone. So for her, all my hurting behaviour is on purpose. 
They always jump to the worst conclusion; I’m not in terrible pain for days; I’m just being moody and not replying to their texts. 
They don’t understand that I have nothing happening in my life for the past years except my illnesses. I can’t out and I’m losing a lot of my friends ( not on bad terms but it hurts to reply to every “how are you?” With “bad”). 
And I love my family so much, they’re the most important persons to me, the closests. But I just learnt that it was only one way. I was close to them but they didn’t know me. 
You know what the worse is? I don’t remember all that bad behaviour, I zone out/dissociate a lot. Apparently I yell; I don’t remember ever having an argument with my little brother but he just told me it happened several times last summer. I was very mean with all of them, yelled at them and said horrible things ( again I don’t remember).  So they cut me off for several months, September to Christmas. Then I did something wrong for my sister’s birthday apparently and was cut off again in February. My mother only invited me to live with her because she had to pay my rent ( moved in with her end of April). They stopped telling me when they cut me off because apparently I don’t change. 
So my question to you all; I want to explain to them that it’s the depression and ask them to give me another chance ( I’m getting myself into a psychiatric hospital by the end of the week). But a big part of me don’t want to hurt them, to guilt them into forgiveness. I realised how much pain and hurt I caused, and it would be so much better for them if I got out of their life. 
It’s so hard to keep on living every day when you are in non stop pain ( it will be for life, there is no cure, but it won’t kill me so not a Medical research’s priority). I am useless, I can’t provide anything to society, I can’t work, I can’t have kids, I will be someone’s burden all my life. I am suicidal, but the only thing that kept me going was them. I couldn’t do it because it would hurt them. But I already hurt them alive, how much worse can dying really be ? Im seriously thinking of going to Switzerland for the assisted suicide charities, I don’t want one of them to find me dead and traumatise/hurt them even dead.

I used to play the cello, and do ballet, and paint and draw, and read a lot, but the pain shakes and the medication makes it too hard now ( kids’Paint by number are too hard for me). 
On top of those chronic illnesses; I have to battle PTSD for multiple rapes, a psychologically abusive ex, medical malpractices, absent father, school bullying ( from preK to A levels), being sterile and daily pain. 
Not a surprise if I tell you I am depressed. 
And I thought the best thing to do was to just deal with all of that myself, to prove them I was independent and strong. Not to burden them because they already had their problems to deal with. 
But no. My brother in law gifted my sister a “how to deal with narcissists” book and I just realised it was about me. 
I had to move in with my mom ( parents going through a separation right now), because I wasn’t able to take care of myself on a daily basis (like food and showers and cleaning and groceries ect were too much). 
And I’ve been treating her like shit. I would be on the streets without her. 
And I thought I had the behaviour that conveyed my gratitude. That’s the worse part, it wasn’t on purpose. The pain gave me tunnel vision and I was so focused on one meal at a time, one step at a time.
They know me so badly they gifted me shelves for my birthday, and did party food ( crisps and mini toasts), because they don’t know my favourite foods. 
I thought I was masking my daily bad moods ( very hard to be happy when your one and unique thought is PAIN), but they were suffering. 
I treated my mum like a slave, I didn’t even say good mornings or thanks to all the chores she did for me. 
I knew I did something bad because she’s been retreating herself from me, leaving me to deal alone with my mess. 
3 days ago I had a flare up so bad I was immobilised and crying /yelling in pain for several hours. The neighbours got worried and called the cops and ambulance. They took me to the hospital and kept me for 3days to ran tests and control the pain. Apparently they came ( mum and brother)to my room and knocked to check up on me and I didn’t hear them. Now, my mum is angry at me because she was ashamed of having to deal with the cops.
A part of me is tired to be made the bad guy every time. If I go to my room to deal with my pain ( like at Christmas), I’m sulking and ignoring everyone. My mum says « to not check for non intentional consequences/ accidents of your actions, is doing it on purpose », basically if you cared you would have thought ahead if it would hurt anyone. So for her, all my hurting behaviour is on purpose. 
They always jump to the worst conclusion; I’m not in terrible pain for days; I’m just being moody and not replying to their texts. 
They don’t understand that I have nothing happening in my life for the past years except my illnesses. I can’t out and I’m losing a lot of my friends ( not on bad terms but it hurts to reply to every “how are you?” With “bad”). 
And I love my family so much, they’re the most important persons to me, the closests. But I just learnt that it was only one way. I was close to them but they didn’t know me. 
You know what the worse is? I don’t remember all that bad behaviour, I zone out/dissociate a lot. Apparently I yell; I don’t remember ever having an argument with my little brother but he just told me it happened several times last summer. I was very mean with all of them, yelled at them and said horrible things ( again I don’t remember).  So they cut me off for several months, September to Christmas. Then I did something wrong for my sister’s birthday apparently and was cut off again in February. My mother only invited me to live with her because she had to pay my rent ( moved in with her end of April). They stopped telling me when they cut me off because apparently I don’t change. 
So my question to you all; I want to explain to them that it’s the depression and ask them to give me another chance ( I’m getting myself into a psychiatric hospital by the end of the week). But a big part of me don’t want to hurt them, to guilt them into forgiveness. I realised how much pain and hurt I caused, and it would be so much better for them if I got out of their life. 
It’s so hard to keep on living every day when you are in non stop pain ( it will be for life, there is no cure, but it won’t kill me so not a Medical research’s priority). I am useless, I can’t provide anything to society, I can’t work, I can’t have kids, I will be someone’s burden all my life. I am suicidal, but the only thing that kept me going was them. I couldn’t do it because it would hurt them. But I already hurt them alive, how much worse can dying really be ? Im seriously thinking of going to Switzerland for the assisted suicide charities, I don’t want one of them to find me dead and traumatise/hurt them even dead. 
Opened to all suggestions and advice and help, 
Thank you in advance for reading all this. &lt;/p&gt;

She treats me like trash most of the time, I feel like her slave and nothing more as I do everything she tells me to do, but I feel like all I am to her is an object to do her tasks for her. 

Recently I felt really down, suicidal, I told her I couldnt handle being in the same room as her and I stepped out to lay down by myself to collect my thoughts. After a while I realized the state that I was in I couldn’t stop thinking that way and I just wanted to cry alone and doze off. I let her know I would do this and she said it was okay with a sad face emoji. I knew this meant she wasn’t okay with it and she stopped responding to me all together. She tells me to be the bigger person in the relationship and at that moment all I could think about was how to make her feel better. I quickly got myself together for her sake and came back, she kept telling me why I came back and I told her it was because I was worried for her. Eventually she asked me why, I told her I was feeling suicidal again. She didn’t say anything to comfort me, or atleast I didn’t feel comforted. Then she went on to tell me how I made her mad and how I make her feel worthless because I don’t do enough for her. I just feel so unseen and honestly writing all this out makes me feel so selfish. 

My suicidal tendencies aren’t because of her or this, this definitely feeds onto it though. 

Just now she called me asking me where I put something she bought as a gift, I told her I didn’t know and after her searching everywhere she believes I left it in her old house. I told her to contact someone there to be given the chance to find it but she completely shuts me down. I offer to do it for her and she says it’s useless. I offer to pay for it and tells me I’m broke and she doesn’t want my money. 

I’m boarding a plane right now, she knows it, but she never told me to have a safe flight or anything like that.

,SuicideWatch,"Okay, so, there's a few things that have led me here which I'll spare you all the details, but I plan on ending it all in September. I'm absolutely sure I want to do this if nothing has changed by then. I don't have an exact date planned yet, however, I'm thinking maybe September 10. I do have a plan as to how I do it. And yes, I'm still going to try. I'm still going to go to therapy. I'm still going to apply for jobs. I'm still going to live life as if I weren't about to end it because I do want to die knowing I tried. I don't necessarily WANT to kill myself, but I will if I have to - and the heartache is painstakingly bad that it feels almost inevitable.

My question to you is how would you spend this time? Knowing you're about to take yourself off the earth forever and have to look the people who would attend your funeral in the eyes. Do I spend time with them? Do I detach? I'd love to spend time with them before I do it, but I don't know if I can in good conscience but also... I don't know if I CAN'T in good conscience. I've been splurging on random things, but I feel guilty because any money left over that I have could be used to cover any death-related costs.

I don't know. I kind of wish I had someone to actually talk these plans through, but of course, like we would with anyone, try and convince them to stay alive. I'm afraid of telling my therapist this because 1. I don't want them to feel burdened or like they couldn't help me enough, and 2. I don't want to go to a mental hospital (even though some might say that's where I belong).

There are so many feelings. I don't know what to do with them or how to process them. I guess what I'm looking for is a change, but in this economy and this society, it feels impossible. I know it takes hard work, and believe me, I've been trying.

I have a history of suicide, I tried when I was 14 and failed (which is quite ironic because I was doing it because I felt like a failure). I’m 26 now and the feelings have got stronger and stronger day by day. 

It’s hard to explain because on paper I’m very fortunate. I’ve got a good job, I’ve got mostly a good lifestyle and I live one of the best cities in the world. Butttt.. I hate myself, I hate everything about myself outside of the situation I’m in. 

I hate my skin colour, it makes me feel like an outsider in my own country, with my own friends. I’ve been brought up in a society that I believe thinks being white is better and that’s more so drilled into me and my thinking.

My dad left my family when I was young. Which I think is pretty common but it’s the lack of effort he tried with me. His only communications with me, if we can even classify it as that, was to goad my mother.

Frankly, I don't want to die at this moment. Disappearing sounds amazing, but me comitting suicide would make my mom very sad and I don't want to put her through that. 

It's really weird and stupid, but for years and years I've just had intense fantasies of getting really hurt and being hospitalized. I have no idea why, as I know this wouldn't fix anything, and probably just make me feel worse. But Gods, I just want someone to actively care for me and see how miserable I am.

Yesterday evening I told myself, tomorrow would be the day. This morning I was supposed to slit my wrists. Not sure what the plan was after that. Either call the emergency number myself or have my mom help. 

Well, I did it, kinda. Not enough to seriously hurt me though. 

I just can't get it out of my head, and everyday I'm in a constant debate whether I should do it or not. 

What I absolutely do not want though, is to get the rest of my family involved in this, and Gods those social workers. No offense, they're just doing their jobs, but I seriously cannot deal with those people anymore and I can already imagine the conversations. Also a mental hospital sounds absolutely miserable. 

Then, make it look like an accident? Be hit by a car? I frequently go out, it wouldn't be strange for me to wound up in an accident at all. But that'd hurt damn bad, and the chance of me dying would be bigger.

These thoughts are horrible and I've had them for so long, but never have I been so close to actually following them as I am now. I just *cannot* live like this anymore. I am so goddamn miserable everyday and no one can do anything about it.

So much therapy, so much different medication, so much ""how does that make you feel?"", so much being forced to look into my future when I don't see anything there, and *none* of it has helped in the slighest. I'm done, I need a break. 

I can't talk about this with my mom, it'd make her so concerned and she already has too much stuff going on, in general I just cannot seem to talk about anything like this face to face with someone, and I'd be scared a therapist would put me in a mental hospital.

,SuicideWatch,"
Im 17f, and a military brat to start this off. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve dealt with major rage issues, I’ve slammed and broken iPads, computers, household items, punched walls, etc you get the point. This, mixed with a dad with PTSD (and probably bipolar) and a sister with audhd made home hell. It felt like constantly walking on eggshells.

For a while in my life, the mix of my dad being a chronic asshole and my mom just trying to enjoy her life lead to lots of fighting. A lot. There were months where there would be screaming matches every day between parents, where computer mice were being thrown through walls from across the house (impressive throw though) or smaller things broken. This usually ended with a “we’re getting a divorce” (spoiler, it never happened), being threatened hundreds of times. Whenever I talked to my sister, it turned into a game of rules, what can I say not to peeve her, what can I listen to on my phone, what can I do in her presence to not bother her, which a lot of times ended up happening anyways. When we were kids, whenever we argued we were told to just shut up, and we’ve grown up hearing yelling, so when we disagree nowadays we do just that. It turns into a game of who can hurt the other more. This makes my relationship with her very rocky, we’ll go from pissed to happy to pissed again, to once again happy within the same day, every day.

When I was a kid, things started popping up early, me scratching myself at 6-7, moving onto poking myself with needles when I was 8-9. This only got worse as I went to blades. My parents swear it’s a teenage thing, but because of the ages mentioned I don’t think it is. I’ve always felt this way. A mix of how easily I flip out now, and how I treat myself and others, my family sometimes treats me like I’m just crazy, which pisses me off more and makes me start insulting them. I know part of it is pent up anger, but I’m starting to think they’re right. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I cannot get myself to get up and go to school anymore, I’ll miss 70+ days a year even though my school is only half the average school day. 4 hours. I cannot handle 4 hours of school. In turn, my dad yells. I cannot keep friends, I go through a phase where I’m obsessed with one friend, then I ghost everyone else and sometimes even said friend I’m fixated on in the moment, simply as a “do they care”, and even if they do message me I continue doing so. This makes friendships hard, I’m constantly finding a new friend every few months, even though I have others messaging me asking to hang out. I scream at my family, I ghost my friends, I cannot keep my room cleaned to save my life, ive been pushing for a psychiatrist for years because of my doctor suggesting potential adhd, and a mix of my parents not wanting to accept both of their children can have issues and psychiatrists full on ignoring us because the area we live in is godawful when it comes to mental health is making it impossible. I’ve tried anti depressants, and it hasn’t worked much, and I don’t benefit those around me. 

As a kid I was an edgelord, and I still am I guess, when I was 7-8 I watched gore, I won’t say the website but it was a very well known site. It was a mix of morbid curiosity and outlet, maybe I was partly trying to understand my dad at the time with his combat related ptsd, why he was so mean. I used to flex this to my friends, describe all the gnarly details as if it was something to show off, then I’d go home and watch that same thing. I know now how cringey that was. The issue is is that habit stuck, I still find myself visiting those sites, and doing mass research into any crime that sounded interesting to read. I know it’s cringey. Although, suicide videos always stuck out to me since I was a kid, it always being an escape in the back of my mind because of it.

Now I’m here, I just got done being left on hold for over an hour while trying to get ahold of a psychiatrist again, I’ve been hospitalized for attempts before, you’d think they’d care more but it’s been years of this. Years of being given referrals to clinics that don’t take my families insurance or just flat out ignore us. There is nothing I can do anymore. I feel so done with it all. No one’s taking new patients. I’m sick of screaming at my family, I’m sick of making my friends feel like shit because I can’t message back, I’m sick of feeling my heart get torn in two every time I get a message telling me that a friend is done with me, and I’m sick of being forced through these overwhelmingly strong emotions with nothing helping.

This is probably very poorly written but I do not care, i feel like a broken record and I don’t think I want to continue ts. I cannot believe how much the mental health system has failed me, I tried getting help, and got ignored. They couldn’t care less about me and I’m done giving a shit in a life where no one else does

CW: Possible pedophilia 

I just remembered something that happened when I was about 13 years old and it’s stressing me out. I think I walked in on my little sister (who would’ve been about 11 at the time) masturbating to a picture of out step - nephew who would’ve been a toddler then. Or I just saw the photo of him on my sister’s phone, there was no nudity in the pic or anything explicitly sexual, it just looked like my sister found a regular photo of him and zoomed in on his butt and screenshotted it. I don’t really remember this and I don’t know for sure if it was him but I do remember finding other pictures on her phone of similar things that she found on google but they were adults. I told her and our youngest brother about these other photos and she said she just thought they were funny or something (I think) and I thought it was funny too. But I sometimes sort of remember walking in on her masturbating to one of the photos but I honestly can’t remember any of this clearly and it’s stressing me out so much.

&lt;p&gt;I just remembered something that happened when I was about 13 years old and it’s stressing me out. I think I walked in on my little sister (who would’ve been about 11 at the time) masturbating to a picture of out step - nephew who would’ve been a toddler then. Or I just saw the photo of him on my sister’s phone, there was no nudity in the pic or anything explicitly sexual, it just looked like my sister found a regular photo of him and zoomed in on his butt and screenshotted it. I don’t really remember this and I don’t know for sure if it was him but I do remember finding other pictures on her phone of similar things that she found on google but they were adults. I told her and our youngest brother about these other photos and she said she just thought they were funny or something (I think) and I thought it was funny too. But I sometimes sort of remember walking in on her masturbating to one of the photos but I honestly can’t remember any of this clearly and it’s stressing me out so much. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I have other reddit accounts but need to post this under this account because quite frankly the name fits how I feel. This is long, but context, I wrote this right now after the thoughts and actions of last night.

Looking back, I think I was having a mental health crisis last night. For some reason, at dinner, I felt a wash of calmness come over me about my life. This calmness is **not** the type of calmness someone should have. 

I thought “maybe if I just go to sleep, the thoughts won’t be as prevalent”. Then I woke up in the middle of the night with these thoughts in my head the loudest they’ve ever been. Then I bargained with myself “If you write them down, then they are real, and you need help. If you don’t write them down; you’ll be ok.” Finally, the voice was so loud I had no choice. I started to write from 4-7AM I was research and preparing.

When my sister died, we had a terrible time finding all her accounts and contacting her friends. 

Last night I took multiple steps in preparation.

·      Made a sheet with all my important account logins (with instructions on specific logins to make sure they don’t cancel things like my cell phone before all those are completed)

·      Located the deed to the house (at least I think it’s the deed)

·      Turned off things like two factor authentication on accounts wherever possible and FaceID

·      Confirmed the beneficiaries of my employer life insurance policies? (Did you know that some policies through your employer only allow you to change your beneficiaries during either a life event or open enrollment?)

·      Tried to confirm if self-extermination would still pay out the above (in general policies apparently do after 2-3 years of being written – always check your specific policy though)

·      What contact they should let know that I self-committed.

In addition to the above, I even started to do one of those online wills. But then I realized the following.

·      I need two people to sign my will. Who could I get to sign this without setting off alarm bells.

·      Would my last will and testament even be valid when it was created in crisis?

Then finally I started writing a letter to my mom. It wasn’t a letter explaining why I did the irreversible; but why I felt this way and how I promised her if I ever felt this way, I would seek emergency help. Then I questioned myself, ""Am I really at that point""?

I then decided to find a better definition of what it means to be in a mental health crisis. Does thinking about self-extermination make a crisis? If so, I’ve been in one for years with varying intensity. Does preparing for the logistics of post expiration make a crisis? We all know that if someone attempts self-extermination they are in crisis. But what about before that? How do you recognize that you, yourself, in that moment, are in crisis and need help but don't have a fully thought out plan?

By this time, it was about 7AM. I decided that I am unable to work today and e-mailed my boss such. I almost slept on the floor of my bathroom because it is the only room that I could make completely dark to match how I felt. However, I did not go that far. I just kept the ac at the temp I normally sleep in and cocooned myself in my blanket in a tightness I have never done before and slept. If I woke up, I would just lay in my cocoon till I would fall asleep again. I kept doing this till now, 1500 US eastern.

I am telling myself I am writing this because I am unsure I need help, and I think I may have to go at least on a 72-hour hold, but because for me

The feelings aren’t going away, they may become subdued; but they do flare back. Even in this moment, as I close out this, I still wonder if I am crisis and need to seek emergency help. The scary thing is what they will do to me, and how at that point, I will truly feel like I have failed at life.

,SuicideWatch,"Throwaway account 

I just build a house with my wife. I never wanted to do it but because I had/have troubles saying what is important to me we did it. And by we I mean me. I coordinated everything, worked my ass of while it was build and had an extremely tense and devastating year of 2023. my batteries were empty when the construction phase ended and I was deeply depressed. Then the moment came and we moved in and I have to say that I hate the house. On the one hand it’s loud and build on a place I never wanted to live but if I am truly honest, it’s the house itself. Everything it stands for - the way my life turned out and how it is filled with things I never wanted. I fell into a deep state of depression, lost 10kg (20lbs) since march and was crying almost every day. But I pulled myself out of this hole by going to my therapist, doing sports and then eventually taking medicine against my anxiety. I found some ground again when I was recognizing something on my stomache while doing some woodwork and I went to the hospital. 2 hours later I was in the OR getting operated on my belly. Everything was good, I went home, fell in the same depression and was hit by extreme pain 2 days later. Went to the hospital again and had to stay 7 more days because my wound was infected. Now I have to rest since 6 weeks. Can’t do sports, can’t really move and I am deeply unhappy. I find happy moments while doing music and I was brave (or call it dumb) and went to a concert this week. Wasn’t too good for the wound but I needed this. However there is this constant flow of darkness surrounding me and it just is there all the time. A couple of weeks ago at my lowest point I made plans to kill myself. Now they are reappearing over and over again. I stand up - I feel helpless - I count the hours on the clock until the day is over and I restart again. I am so lost. I hate this house, I hate my life, I am beginning to fall apart from my relationship, to my friends I feel like I am a liar and I can’t get rid of this constant pain. I don’t feel any good. I hate myself so much for this. I am sitting in a fancy new house, with a wife that loves me, yes I had surgery but that’s gonna heal and if I want to I can be a father soon.

,SuicideWatch,"I often get made fun of for my poor English skills, which makes me really anxious about speaking. Just thinking about it gives me panic attacks. My classmates tease me about how I look, so I don’t really consider them friends. I’ve always dreamed of having a British accent, hoping it would help me fit in better. But most of the time, I feel lonely and isolated. At 19, I haven’t had the usual experiences like going to parties or having close friends. I worry about my future a lot and feel like I’ve failed, even though I used to dream of being an astronaut since I was four. Agoraphobia keeps me indoors; I’m too scared to go outside, even when my family goes on trips. I constantly think about my flaws and feel empty, much more than just typical teenage struggles.

Living in a developed country where everyone speaks English fluently makes me feel even more inadequate. I get jealous when I hear someone from another country speak with a perfect accent and flawless grammar, and it makes me feel like I’m not brave enough. Even my relatives, including my cousin, call me a coward because I’m afraid to speak English. Whenever I try to speak, it usually ends with people laughing or avoiding me. High school was tough; I was bullied a lot, called names like “monkey,” and people made hurtful jokes. My self-esteem is low, and I think I’m unattractive and unwanted. Whenever there are team activities, I’m always seen as weak or left out when others pick their teams. My parents favor my lighter-skinned brother, which makes me feel unloved and constantly compared unfairly.

In my native country, it was no better. My kindergarten teacher used to make fun of me and physically abuse me so severely that it lasted for years until I moved to the UK at 14. The teachers there shamed and physically abused me for minor reasons, but where I lived, this treatment was normal. My parents were also harsh; they would beat me severely for even the smallest mistakes, never giving me a chance to learn. My so-called friends used to mock my appearance, calling me ugly and making me feel worthless. Now, at my age, people make fun of me because I’m still a virgin. It’s led me to smoke and drink beer, neglecting my self-care and feeling like I don’t matter anymore.

I have always been labeled as weak and a failure, especially by my dad who constantly tells me I will never succeed. He looks at me with disappointment, seeing only failure. I’ve never achieved anything worthwhile; I feel like a coward and stupid too. Exams and assessments were always my worst nightmare; I consistently received the lowest marks. In group discussions, no one liked me because of my language barrier; they often ignored me or skipped over me altogether. I’m scared to become an adult because I feel too weak, and I worry that I’ll end up alone. These thoughts weigh heavily on me, making me doubt my ability to handle adulthood.Oh and btw lm black

I wish I could give my life to someone who is dying and wants to live. That will be so great. That's such a selfish thing to think about you will think but dwag u have no one no one to cry on my funeral to it can't be selfish thing.
I feel like I'm mentally being bullied idk the right word to use here.  I heard my teacher he teaches the subject in which I'm really weak at and he is the one not doing his job properly because he was calling me out in some other  class which doesn't make any sense. He didn't help me in anyways in which I can do better. But he is calling me out in some other class which I'm not related to??? Why??? One was my formal friend told me this. I was just shocked why will an adult even think in that way.... there is whole lot of thing going in my life that is pretty interpersonal which no one knows and will never know.anyways i had exam last week I did fuck up really badly that badly that I feel like ending myself. Like this was the easy exam for all of us and I fucked that up. Made me realize that I don't have Aims in my life I have no knowledge to live further. Thinking to end up or overdosing myself with my close ones tb medicines I heard that those are really strong medicines so like I can skip tomorrow and have some time with myself and end tomorrow? I don't really want to end things but I really don't want to live either. I want to sleep and never wake up or i want to start earning already and stop with this education situation. Like I really don't understand and there is no one for me I can't even call someone my real friend ykwim. I feel really illiterate and unloveable. I'm going through a stage I don't want to live My hairs are all greasy I don't want to step in bathroom cause I have some plans there to end things. Im scared if someone saw me in that situation and i will still be alive or the pain tbh I told u yk I want to sleep and never wake up that typa death is my dream. By hearing my words you can tell I'm failure will be failure will be hated will be illiterate will be loner ahh that's it

There were times the thoughts were worse, I’d thought about how and where. I’d stashed pills ‘just incase’. I’d written notes. Never solid plans, but it was on my mind all the time. 

One night things got really bad and I had an episode that could have taken my life. I was ok but that was the start of me getting therapy and I worked on myself for years. I did eventually get better. I had turned my life around in a way and thought things were going to be good from then on. I was really proud of myself for all I’d overcome. I thought I had the chance of a good life, but it was a lie. It all crumbled. Long story short, the circumstances were all my fault but I lost the thing that mattered to me more than anything. My cat, I’d had her for 6 years since she was a kitten. I loved her so much. She was always there for me and she was the reason I didn’t act on my thoughts to end it, when the pain became overwhelming. I knew no one would love her how I did, so I stayed. Then I got better and always promised her that I’d keep getting better and build a good life for us. Instead I fell for a man who claimed to love me, but just used and abused me instead. My self esteem and identity and all the work I’d done to heal was undone. Worst was what happened with me giving up my cat, only for her to die, which was the most traumatic thing I’ve been through. I died that day too, really. Nothing has been ok since then. Not really. It is all my fault she is gone. She saved my life and I betrayed her.

I tried to heal. I really did. From the outside people would think I’m doing great. I left the toxic relationship. I got a new job. New place to live. Even eventually rescued a sweet dog from the shelter, who I of course do love, but it’s just not the same. It isn’t the same connection. It isn’t enough for me to stay for. The emptiness I feel without my soul cat is too great. The pain of her being gone, knowing it was my fault and she didn’t have to go, it’s unbearable. The anger I feel towards myself, and the anger towards my ex who broke me down and took everything from me. He got to move on without any consequences. While I am left a shell of who I was. I lost my life. 

I have fought before. I have been strong before, but I always had her to comfort me. This time is different. I am more tired than ever. It’s been over 3 years since then. 3 years of trying to move on without her. I don’t know if I can keep trying. I don’t want to die, but I need all this pain to stop. I dont take care of myself anymore. I’m doing the bare minimum to survive. 

I’m just surviving out of shame now really. Because I don’t want this dog to have to go back to the shelter, and because my house is a mess and I don’t want anyone to find it this way. I’m trying to work on organising my things, but I don’t have the energy. Maybe it’s for the best, because I worry about how I’ll go with 1 less reason to stay when I already have so few.

 I’m sick and tired of this life. I’ve been through so much in life i could write a book and to top it off, my fiancé took his own life last year. I haven’t even hit 25 yet and my life feels ruined. ill never love someone the way I loved him. i’ll never get to have children now (pretty sure I can’t anyways due to endometriosis) or be married. i’ll never have my happily ever after (by choice, I refuse to find a new partner) i’ll never be the same person I once was.  

I’ve had on and off depression for years and i’m TIRED of it. i’m tired of faking like life is okay when it isn’t. i’m tired of hiding how I really feel. I’m miserable. I’ve tried taking my own life in dumb ways (OTC pills and eye drops, i know. dumb.) and of course I never took enough to cause actual damage. The worst part is i’m scared to do anything further because I don’t want to feel pain. It’s cowardly. Everyone says someone who truly wants to take their life will just do it, but it’s hard. This isn’t a cry for help, it’s just how i really feel. 

Every time i’ve tried, I got so sick and regretted it simply because I was still alive and throwing up. Never went to the hospital for any of my attempts. I suffered in my room in silence. My 2nd to last attempt I research for hours on drinking Visine (yes, the eyedrops). I drank 6 bottles and guess what? Nothing. I felt like I was nodding out and two days later I was back to normal. I was in the car with my friends and they didn’t even notice meanwhile my heart rate was slowing and i was losing hearing a bit. i fell asleep in my car and woke up hours later still alive. Why is it so hard?

 I hate expressing how I feel because then everyone looks at you like a charity case or says how ungrateful you are. I have been on depression meds, hate them. I won’t talk to a therapist or anything because advice doesn’t help me. I will fake like it does but it truly doesn’t. I’m so tired of being here!!! I’m so so fucking tired. “It gets better” Yes, it does for some people but i’m not one of them. I’ve had suicidal ideations daily for YEARS. I want to swallow all the pills I have right now but I can’t even fathom the fact of ANOTHER failed attempt and getting sick. Worst case scenario waking up in a hospital room with my family crying wondering what they could do differently. 

I miss my fiancé, I want to be with him. I don’t want to feel this pain anymore. I’m so miserable and there’s only one way out but it’s so hard to reach. It sounds sick but I pray every day that someone with a terminal illness and I can switch places. I would do it in a heartbeat. There’s so many people who want to live and don’t get the chance, why can’t I take their spot? I’m not selfish, I know how it sounds but it’s just how my brain is wired. I’m tired of heartbreak, waking up every day, having to pretend like I love life. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my family and I know people have it worse than I do, but man I just want to be gone. I don’t want my family to feel the way I feel about my fiancé leaving me which is why I hope for a freak accident or something to happen to me so they don’t have to feel guilt. i’m desperate to leave this world and I wish someone understood that.

I struggle with suicidal thoughts every day, around the ages of 8-12 I used to act on it very often every time it was ignored and my mum had completely forgotten about it until recently when I brought it up in an argument and still wasn't concerned.

I've built a nice life for myself I have people around me that I can trust and I love, an amazing boyfriend, and a decent job.

It takes everything inside me to get up every day and take care of my house and husband and kids and a full time job and family and friends and pets. I can't mask it anymore. I can't pretend everything is ok. I've dealt with relationship trauma, family trauma and drama, financial ups and downs, medical issues upon medical issues, and truthfully just terrible luck. Every corner I turn there's a challenge and a struggle. Simple things are never simple.

I'm done. I surrender. I quit. I feel like I'm being held hostage to stay alive. How can someone else tell me that I should keep living or not? Should that be up to the person actually having to live that life?

I have so many people that are clueless to how I feel on a daily basis. I've been able to put on a front for so long. But if I'm not allowed to end my life, then I will slowly kill myself. I started smoking again. Getting very high once everyone is asleep. I'm done taking care of myself. 

It would be easier on everyone, especially my husband and kids, if I could just slip out the metaphorical back door and everyone could be at peace. They wouldn't have me to deal with and infect their life anymore. And I wouldn't have to be in pain. But I can't. I'm stuck here and it's bullshit. 

I recorded messages for people closest to me. I thought that would wake me up and make me keep going but it just felt like another check mark forward on this journey to end my life. I've been getting rid of my things slowly so that it's a minimal burden on those if and when I go.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi, it's 03:32 AM when I'm writing this. I guess I just will write what's on my mind and maybe feel better after that. So, I'm 16, I have an amazing boyfriend and I love him so fucking much... I can't even describe how much I love that boy.

I had my first suicidal thought when I was 14. Bad things happened involving someone I really cared about. I remember I was crying so much, and then I thought about fucking killing myself for the first time. After that, more shit started to happen, with that I begun with the selfharm and after that, smoking, just to try to feel less pain. The fact is: in the last 2 years, a LOT of shit have been happening to me all the time and you know what? It's not like I'm not blamed for some of them. Last year, I had my first suicide attempt after a breakup. My parents were there to give me all the support I needed and that makes me feel like the worst person in the world. They don't deserve it. They deserve better, they deserve a child who don't fucking give problems. Does that makes sense? I don't have idea. I started dating my boyfriend in June 3 and things got better since then, but sometimes I feel like I'm not enough, and with sometimes I mean every fucking day. I want him to be happy and I'm fucking sure he won't be happy having to deal with trash like me. I'm so lucky to have him by my side but I hate myself so much that I catch myself thinking that I don't deserve to be happy and in fact I don't deserve any happiness. I'm a hopeless teenager whose only future certainly is death. I should just kill myself already and then my boyfriend would find someone better. Someone who don't selfharm every fucking day, someone who don't need to smoke to feel alive, someone better. Someone who won't give problems and will give him happiness. If by some reason you still reading this shit, I'm sorry for wasting your time, friend. Live a happy life and don't be a useless fucking trash as I did. 
I just need a final trigger to do it. I got ways to do it, I know how to do it, but I'm a fucking coward who have fear of pain. I want to die but I don't want to feel pain. Makes sense? Probably not.

,SuicideWatch,"So, I’ve pretty much decided it’s time. I’ve got my method figured out and supplies ready- won’t disclose because it’s costly and will surely do the job, with the least amount of pain. Last time I attempted the gun misfired, that was a few years ago and I couldn’t bring myself to do it again.

That was what I thought was the lowest point in my life. I’ve wanted to die since I was 7, I was always different from everyone else, and bullied horribly for it. I transitioned into a girl when I was in my mid-teens. Got addicted to meth and heroin, and I just planned on using until I died. Unfortunately that didn’t happen fast enough and after 6 overdoses I guess I thought I couldn’t die. My family member actually was there with me one time and left me there alone in case I died and police showed up. I woke up projectile vomiting.
By the time I had gotten out of addiction I was an adult and my father (RIP) got diagnosed with an incurable degenerative disease and passed a few years later. I was working in the service industry and didn’t think about school.
 
One day I met my stbxh. When I tell you it was like the sky opened up and everything came together believe me, it was magical. I left the service industry for a better career path during covid, and started to actually make good money. Everything was looking good and I was feeling okay for once, but we (stbxh) were off and on every few months. Nothing and nobody compared to him, and I could never forget him, never could be with anyone else. So after a year separated, we got back together. Eventually we got married, I thought he had really changed. 

I ended up leaving my job to be a sahw. Life happened, time passed and one day he sat me down and said he wanted a divorce. The one person I ever truly loved and could see myself with, the most perfect man in the world really just pulled the rug out from under me again. Except this time I lost everything. Our home is his property, I had no job, no health insurance, nothing to fall back on except my mother. She and I share the same bed because all the other rooms are occupied by other family members. All of my stuff is still in boxes because there’s nowhere to put it. 

I really tried hard to pull myself out of it, I got a new job, got accepted into school, saved up for one of my passions, but the truth is that I can’t even think about enjoying any of the rewards of my hard work. I have literally no friends (none, I am completely alone and always have been. Except for one friend who I don’t talk to anymore because even that relationship was codependent), my family is addicted and dysfunctional, my poor cat misses her father and yowls every night, and the love of my life disposed of me once again like nothing. All I’ve ever wanted was to be loved like that, and I had it. Now it’s gone and I think about the life I’m creating now and it’s meaningless. I think about the future and it’s bright and fruitful, but it’s meaningless. I know I won’t ever feel that way for someone else and there’s no job, possession or accomplished dream that can replace it. My options are just too narrowed as a trans person.

So here I am at the even lower lowest point in my life. I’m ready, and I’m gonna make sure I don’t fail this time. I just really needed to tell someone because this has been a secret I’ve kept to myself for decades now so I don’t end up hospitalized. I’ve really thought about my options and this is truly the only feasible solution, I won’t ever be happy like I once was and I will be alone forever. And I’m so envious of people who can thrive like that but I’m not one of those people. I’m tired of being alone. I’m rambling, I’m sorry. I just needed to get this off my chest because no one knows. I know, this whole thing sounds stupid and pathetic. That’s definitely how I feel right now. Stupid, alone, thrown out, codependent and pathetic.

I’m 16 

I split with my best friend of many years because she had begun physically abusing me and then I told her I thought I was going to kill myself and she blatantly didn’t care. That was the beginning of the end. 

A few months later, she spread rumours all around my school that I lied about a bunch of random shit, the state I was born, my sisters name, my self harm, etc that I didn’t, but no one believes me for some reason, even though it’s so easy for me to disprove to everyone. Everyone is constantly talking so bad about me saying horrible and disgusting things and I couldn’t take it. So I stopped going to school for pretty much the rest of the year. I’ve been suicidal constantly since this, which was in April. 

Then my parents kicked me out but then randomly out of nowhere reported me missing when they found a paper I wrote before. It basically said if I didn’t check on them before the 20th I’m in danger but DO NOT report me missing under my birth name. For context I had my name legally changed and the original name is my most well guarded secret and embarrassment. Not sure why but hearing it makes me wanna seriously kill myself no joke. 

I said in the letter I wouldn’t kill myself so not to worry because they knew about how I’ve been the past few months UNLESS they reported me under my birth name after the 20th. Then guess fucking what they reported me missing despite kicking me out under my fucking birth name. There would be absolutely no reason they’d need to used this name, it’s not my legal name, it’s on none of my IDs. They were telling me to do it. They got me put in police custody and a mental ward, the worst experiences of my life. 

Now I’m getting further and further off the deep end by the day. I’ve started thinking my pets have been replaced by spies and every typing error I’ve made in this I’ve taken as I sign from God to kill myself. I got super worked up before writing this and usually I’d be calm by now but I’m not.

,SuicideWatch,"I can’t do it anymore.

This world sucks. We’re always reaching some unattainable goal of happiness, suffering through hours every single day just so we can get some dopamine later. I just don’t want to live that way.

My years have gone like this since I could remember:
January-June: Work, classes, sleep, repeat. Too tired to do anything fun because I get worn out.
June-August: Finally relaxing while I wait for impending doom
September-December: Work, classes, sleep, repeat again. 

I’ve repeated this endless cycle forever and I will continue it until the day I die because it’s impossible to break it. It’s simply life in civilization, and it’s come to the point where you can no longer choose to live in the forest or something, but I don’t like it. I don’t want to wait through months of suffering just to get some enjoyment out of life. All I’ve been told is “suck it up” or “I’m sorry, I understand” but that doesn’t give me a solution. I’m a control freak in a world with no control and it brings me misery.

My mother recently took away my self-harming tools and I’ve been at my breaking point. That was my last ditch attempt at coping and it’s now taken away by the people who love me so I can’t even get mad. I don’t think I’ll kill myself anytime soon, but I can’t see myself being alive any further than this. I’ll most likely do it by the start of the school year if something doesn’t change.

,SuicideWatch,"Writing this partly to leave some kind of record and edge myself forward. On a vpn so nobody bother try track me.

After 31 years I'm calling it quits. The last seventeen or so years have been, for the most part, utter misery. No idea how I survived this long but I refuse to any longer. There is quite simply nothing for me in this world. When I was at least somewhat materially comfortable I could keep myself distracted. I hesitate to say happy, but I wasn't constantly thinking about suicide.

Now I am homeless. Can't even get a spot in a hostel or any other kind of temporary housing. Charities and government-adjacent organisations do quite literally NOTHING apart from check that you've essentially registered as homeless (day one obvious stuff) and are aware of where to get a free meal every day. Presumably this is all they do all day and they are paid for it. Bizarre. Glorified directories.

I was on and off various SSRIs for years. Always been skeptical of them but in times of desperation I would go for it. Maybe some small benefit after a few months but hard to tell if it was that or other self improvement things I was trying. Either way, no meaningful difference. Therapy was a joke. Unfortunately, therapy and SSRIs are the only thing medical professionals recommend. ""I know you've tried A, B, C, D and E.... but you haven't tried F yet!"". Fuck you. Another flavour of pill is not going to change me, and my refusal to try is not proof I'm not serious about wanting to get better.

Despite having a long history of depression, whenever I've spoken to them recently they just latch onto the fact that I'm homeless. Obviously its not nice, but that's really not my issue. Worse still, it is very clear they think I'm just trying to score some free food from them and get somewhere to sleep indoors for the night. I've been to A&amp;E three times in five months. One time I was on the very edge of ending it, but they talked me down. The next time I visited I overheard them talking and they flat out stated they thought I was grifting so I left and decided to never speak to them again.

Last roll of the dice was to see my doctor because generally they're more qualified than the social workers role playing as mental health professionals. In addition to SSRIs and therapy she also recommended Jesus. In fairness, my medical history may have had my past beliefs on there which made her comfortable bringing it up - but what the fuck. Won't be going there again. 

Family are trash and not worth talking about. Haven't seen them in years and wouldn't want to. No friends either and I always have to ask myself why. I had them in school which is relatively easy when you're forced to see each other nearly every day. Genuinely enjoyed their company and would sometimes have periods where I would see them outside but it always burned me out after a while and I would pull back. We drifted apart but no hard feelings on my end. I was also involved in a bit of a scandal which definitely was my doing so that finalised things. Met nice people at various jobs but always kept things confined to the office and the occasional work party. Had a few girlfriends but never made it past early stages. The desire to keep it going was never there and I was happier alone. I'd have periods in my life where I told myself ""relationships aren't supposed to be easy, I need to sacrifice more"" and I would always end up hurting myself. Maybe I'm high functioning autistic or have some kind of personality disorder, who knows. Numerous professionals have asked if I'm ""sure"" I haven't been diagnosed with anything but they never press further.

Social issues aside, I have other flaws. I've always been lazy at work. I have known for long time that lack of sleep is a significant driver of my depression but efforts to correct this never lasted longer than a few weeks. I've drank alcohol excessively at points and gotten into some terrible states, though I have ""quit"" for months at a time when I felt like it. FWIW I've not had a drop in months, can't enjoy it living like this. I messed around with a married woman for a brief period despite her having kids and knowing she probably only latched onto me because of family issues she was having. Saying mean shit online. I have been cold to people and sometimes relished in knowing they were feeling hurt. Me simply getting involved in anyone's life knowing I will eventually make a mess.....its not right. This isn't just bad social skills, something else is wrong and I can't make it work despite a general desire to do the right thing and strong aversion to anything outright evil. The willpower isn't there to change myself in any meaningful way.

I've rambled. The burst of emotion which prompted this has faded but the final mission is still scheduled.

Fuck you to:
Teachers at school who witnessed me having a personality transplant overnight and never thought to ask what was wrong.
99% of homeless charities - and homeless people quite frankly.
The NHS. It's dogshit and needs to be pulled by the roots (not just based on my experience)

Thank you to:
My past girlfriends. Love will always be there, sorry I couldn't make it work.
My last two friends. It was only a year but it was special. And I promise I didn't fancy you-know-who. Objectively gorgeous but purely platonic on my end. 
People at work who tolerated me more than was reasonable. 
Everyone from church. Sorry for sudden departure.

But im pretty sure im going to do it tonight. I’ve had a rough life if that’s how I should put it, a lot of bad things have happened to me. And for a while I thought I was getting better, but it turns out that was fake. It doesn’t really improve for me. Up and down, back and forth of happy and sad. I’ve dealt with depression for some time now. And the past few weeks I’ve sort of been driving myself crazy. I’ve also not had a good relationship with the people around me. Me and my mom have been arguing or fighting a lot despite my efforts to avoid it, trying to be better, etc. my siblings hate me. They tell me that everyday and they’ve just resorted to insulting me and telling me to kill myself. I don’t have any friends nor do I have anyone im romantically involved with. I’m alone 99% of the time. I have nobody, I am nobody. I am a living embodiment of nothingness, of failure. 

I try to be a good person. I do good things, I help people whenever I can. I have a job and I’ve been in school. I have always made a point of being there for others in any way possible. But nobody gives me the same. People either use me for money or try to use me for sexual things. That’s all I am to anyone. Someone they can use, who they know won’t argue. I’m a pushover, a failure, a disappointment, and so much worse. 

And I was having a bad day again, and my mother and I had to argue. Like the universe had an itch it needed to scratch. And now im sitting here crying planning everything out. I have no notes to write. Maybe one to my mother apologizing for doing her the disservice of being her child, of ruining her life just by being in it. And just a general note of what I’d like done with my things and my pets. I hope they get taken care of nicely when I’m gone and I hope my things don’t just get thrown away, but if they should, I understand that decision as well. 

I know I can’t talk about methods or anything so I won’t. I don’t plan on doing it in a messy way, I’ve cleaned everything so I don’t have to burden anyone with the cleanup afterwards.

,SuicideWatch,"This is my first and maybe only post here. I'm 34/M. I've been suicidally depressed for many years, but ultimately have admitted to myself that I'll likely never drum up the blistering level of courage it takes to actually follow through. This, ironically, depresses me more than anything. I feel trapped here, unfulfilled and hopeless, because I lack the balls to put a gun to my temple and pull the trigger. 

I spend a lot of time reading and listening to material on suicide, its ethics, testimonials from those affected by it. It's a morbid form of research, but my hope is that I'll eventually find a way to be unafraid, or brave enough in the face of fear to commit. To me, the greatest possible tragedy is continuing on through the length of my natural life, always sad, angry, resentful.

So far, I'm too afraid to buy a gun or the necessary chemicals. But I always knew that if I ever committed, I wouldn't just leave a note. I'd write a small handful of individual letters to my friends and family, apologizing, telling them I love them, trying to explain. I decided to write those letters tonight, and I feel good about it. Like I'm finally doing something. It'll take hours and I'll cry a lot during it, but it's a step that I can take.

I’ve been trying to tell people how I feel - what is going on in my head, but no one - absolutely no one - gets it!

My partner is beautiful, really supportive, but has no idea how close I am to totally losing it - and I can’t tell him for fear of screwing up our relationship and losing him.

I’m so unbelievably tired. I’ve spoken to work - they don’t give a crap, the Union, my local doctors … it’s like I’m screaming at the top of my lungs, but no sound is coming out.

And the amount of times I’ve heard ‘I’m listening’, then paraphrase and it’s nothing like what I’ve just described.

Feel like I’m being unreasonable and should just try harder, but then fall into the void all over again - and it’s getting harder to crawl back out.

No wonder so many people fall between the cracks and lose the battle.

It truly is an invisible disease. If you don’t look sick, you must be seeking attention or trying to get your own way / out of something.

And no one - NO ONE - listens!

I’m so tired and confused. Embarrassed and bloody lost.

At my age (in my fifties now) this shouldn’t be a thing. 

Shouldn’t we heal with time?

If I am not perfect every single day then I don't get done what I need to and I am falling further into debt with myself.

I am currently waiting on a response for 36 scholarships, got denied 7 and only got 2 local ones that add up for $2,000. Even that doesn’t pay off the amount of money I owe my college. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community college is not an option. I told my parent about maybe going there first because I actually cared about debt and they shot it down immediately because they believe community college is only for dummies and that because I was an honor roll student that I should go to my dream college. Them being my parent, I listened to them because the adult is always right, right? I was wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can no longer live. The amount of stress I deal with almost every day thinking about my tuition is unbelievable. I can’t live without stressing. Every day is stressful. My job can’t pay my tuition off. I can’t live knowing I got kicked out of my dream college for being too poor to pay off my tuition.&lt;/p&gt;

Honestly I felt so stupid and dramatic writing all this but I’ll post it anyway because idc anymore. 

I’ve been depressed and feeling suicidal for about 3 months now but things have gotten majorly worse in the past couple weeks. I don’t know how I make it through every day, I’m so bored and there’s nothing I enjoy anymore. The only reason I’ve made it until now is my family and my dog. However my family are going on holiday without me in 2 days. This is like the 5th time they’ve done it because I have severe anxiety and I can’t go with them. This time though, I REALLY need them. I’ve tried expressing what I’m feeling and had the help of my mental health worker too but they’re going anyway. My MH worker thinks they should go too and I’ll cope better than I think I will. I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they’re the only thing keeping me going. And while they’re away my dog is going to the kennels because I can’t even look after her by myself. 

I’ve expressed these thoughts mostly to my MH worker who has relayed them to my family but my family don’t understand why I can’t tell them these things myself. I’ve told them it’s very difficult. I’ve expressed the fact I want to die to all of them (MH worker and family) and I felt like they under reacted. Maybe they think I’m being dramatic and I wouldn’t actually do anything, which was true up until now but now I’m in such an awful place I don’t trust myself not to try to hurt myself or kms. Tonight I self harmed for the first time. I didn’t do much and am too much of a wimp to be honest but I had an urge to do it. I feel like I’m a manipulative bitch because it feels like the urge came from me wanting them to see how bad things are. I still have the urge to do more but like I said, I’m a wimp. Anyway I feel like if I tell my parents, everything will blow up. They get so stressed out about me and I know they need a break but I can’t survive that right now. I honestly feel so stuck. Dying seems like the only way out. 

I’ve also had intrusive thoughts about hurting other people. Like I said, I don’t trust myself. I would never do anything like that in my right mind but clearly I’m not in my right mind right now and I’m worried I’ll go crazy and snap. I genuinely don’t know what to do. If I don’t let my family go I feel like they’ll resent me. But it’s not like there’s even any way I can make them not go. So therefore suicide seems like the only way out.

&lt;p&gt;I want it all gone. Everyone would be happier if I disappeared right? My father wouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay for me to go through school anymore. My girlfriend is so charming and smart and kind that she&amp;#39;d find someone better woth no problem. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I shouldn&amp;#39;t think that I should die. Maybe it&amp;#39;s me being cowardly and trying to avoid facing the consequences of my actions. I just don&amp;#39;t want her to leave. And I know it&amp;#39;s not fair to cling onto her. Or to ask her for forgiveness. I ruined it. I ruined us. And now I&amp;#39;m going to be alone again. And it&amp;#39;s my fault. I think it about it more and more lately. I don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;ll ever do it. But I&amp;#39;m scared I might. I already started cutting myself a bit. I&amp;#39;ve never done that before. I&amp;#39;m joining therapy as well. I think I just wanted to write this to get it off my chest.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"first reddit post and i have no idea what i'm doing, sorry if this is a mess or has typos, but i have no one and nothing else to turn to.

20M, and i barely exist, i have no life in or outside of the house, i have a long distance boyfriend who is great to me and i love him dearly, but i can't fathom putting all of this on him, sometimes he acts in a way that makes me think that my emotions are too much for him, and i can respect that. so, this is truly my only and last choice to talk about this without many limits.  
  
i am unemployed and not schooling at the moment - i've taken a gap year, i was in high school when covid hit and finished my last years from my bedroom, where i have practically been almost every day since for the last three or four years. i am terrified to head into college with all these functional adults, and i've been suicidal since i was eight years old, and i never planned to make it to this age. this all means that i have no idea what to pursue in college, no idea what life i want to try and live. with the rise of AI creatives, i have been completely displaced in my (former) dreams of pursuing something artistic, though i'm fully aware that art hardly makes money, and that my skill does not exceed anyone's - i bring nothing to the table to make me worth looking at over AI anyway. 

as previous stated, i am essentially bed-bound - i've been trying to make more plans to get out of the house, but i can't drive and must rely on my only friend to come pick me up to get me from point A to point B, i do not make any money to pay back the gas that they spend, i am a burden and quite useless in this regard, and it fuels my idea that everyone in my life would be much better without me leeching off of them.

some issues that don't need much elaboration is that: i am overweight, i likely have PCOS (and may have possible fertility issues, i never wanted kids but to have the ability deprived from me when my body is already useless makes me so upset), i am a person of color, i am not very likable, i am unattractive, apart of the lgbtq+ community, i'm not very smart, i haven't achieved anything, i am a financial burden, an emotional burden, all of my hobbies that could potentially generate income - i am mediocre/subpar at, i struggle with a porn and masturbation addiction that i feel horrific about, through all of this, i have come to realize that i have *no* redeeming qualities that make me worth taking up the space that i do. i've tried accepting this fact, but i absolutely can't, because i am surrounded by people and social media that constantly reminds me that the people around me are so much better.

I need someone to come and save me, to take a strong an suddenly interest in my wellbeing. To hold me when I'm having a breakdown and to bring me a bite to eat when I haven't left my bed all day. Someone to pet me and get me to go on a walk with them. Someone to laughing with at stupid things, Someone for me to help as well.

But I don't have that person. I don't have friends, at least none that close. I'm alone. Just me and my cats. I also take help take care of my grandparents that live close by. My mother is in another country, she's dying as well. 

So either someone appears tomorrow and rescues me, or i will do the barely minimum to live, i will take care of those who need me, then the second they are all buried and dead, I will kill myself.

I&amp;#39;ll still be alone. I&amp;#39;ll still have no one to support me when things get tough again or to cheer on my accomplishments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I need someone to come and save me, to take a strong an suddenly interest in my wellbeing. To hold me when I&amp;#39;m having a breakdown and to bring me a bite to eat when I haven&amp;#39;t left my bed all day. Someone to pet me and get me to go on a walk with them. Someone to laughing with at stupid things, Someone for me to help as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I don&amp;#39;t have that person. I don&amp;#39;t have friends, at least none that close. I&amp;#39;m alone. Just me and my cats. I also take help take care of my grandparents that live close by. My mother is in another country, she&amp;#39;s dying as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So either someone appears tomorrow and rescues me, or i will do the barely minimum to live, i will take care of those who need me, then the second they are all buried and dead, I will kill myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not even up for discussion anymore. Therapy is helpful when you have people around you. Otherwise it&amp;#39;s an hour of contact just to be dumped back into isolation right afterwards. &lt;/p&gt;

I know I ""shouldn't care about what others think"", especially if I know the truth of the situation, but I don't understand how you couldn't when life is basically being perceived by people you encounter. Even if this is only a portion of my life and it's not going to be a problem anymore in the future, there's MORE things to worry about in the future. I will have to adjust to adulthood without being able to have found peace as a teenager because I've been struggling with mental health for my whole life. This past year it's like I finally found peace, and it's all arising again because of this stupid misunderstanding. I'm going to graduate, have to go to college / find a job, work the rest of my life away and grow distant from my friends because they're going to be so focused on their occupations. My mother is also 54 this year, I have no doubt that she's going to be dead by the time I'm at least 30.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi friends. I know how stupid it sounds, but the title pretty much sums it up. I apologize that this also kind of gets a bit ramble-y. My mind is really racing atm. But thank you so much for even just deciding to read any of it, being noticed really means a lot. I will do my best to monitor this post and reply to anyone, but this is a throwaway account so bear with me if im slow.

I’m a 17 year old female surrounded by a friend group full of talented artists. For years I have struggled with this feeling of worthlessness because I lack any real talents. Everything in my life seems to revolve around art, and it kills me that im incapable of creating anything im proud of. My friends and I are sort of nerdy and really enjoy making characters and plots and stories together… but it pains me so much that I cannot put what is in my imagination onto paper or tablet. All of my friends get so much joy out of spending time drawing, and I just wish I had that. I am constantly whining and complaining about how bored I am and how much I wish I had a hobby. I have been doodling from time to time since such a young age and even after all these years I have never gotten better. “Practice makes perfect” is one of the biggest lies I have ever heard. Some people just have a natural talent. Yes, practice is important… but it just doesn’t help if you don’t have the initial spark. I’ve tried so hard, I really really have, but any time I try to bring myself to try again, all I want to do is break down crying. All I can do is compare myself to my friends. I know how dumb it is, but I am genuinely considering killing myself just because I have no artistic talent.. it’s all I’ve ever wanted in life and it’s simply not doable. All I want is to be able to fill my mundane life with something that makes me happy. Something that brings me even the smallest bit of joy. But I can’t. I’m simply not good enough, and never will be. I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to keep living so miserably. This is maybe the closest I have ever been to ending it once and for all. I have never previously attempted, but have had police show up at my house to do a welfare check in the past. I wasn’t necessarily planning anything, but I was definitely in a rough mindset. Im just too afraid to really try, and don’t want to hurt my friends and family, as well as my boyfriend (who also heavily struggles with mental health) because he has told me so many times that he would kill himself if he ever lost me to suicide. I don’t want to rip two families to shreds just because of me…

TL;DR: Surrounded by people more talented than me, constantly brought down by my lack of talent. All I’ve ever wanted is to be able to draw, but im simply not good enough for it. I just want to be able to do something that will make me happy because my life is so mundane feeling.

,SuicideWatch,"What should i do if my bf got strong suicidal attempt?

I’ve been dating him for a while and things always go fast and smooth between us, i can say everything is going quite well so far, and we just past the first month of our relationship.

Technically speaking, he’s the very first serious partner in my life and i cherish this relationship a lot, we love each other a lot too.

He told me from the start that he got some mental issues, so yes he has drug problems but nothing like addict, i know it can relieve him sometimes but i hope i can help him to gradually quit this.

At first, he always said things to me like “baby u are legit the only reason that i wouldn’t kill myself” or “i wanna try to quit drugs for u”, i was quite touched and motivated, i sort of wanted to *save* him, i know it’s stupid though but i still feel like so.

A big problem in this relationship is that, most of the time we have to do long distance, his hometown is close to me but not where he does uni right now.

So last time when we saw each other, we spent 4 days together, there was this night where everything was so good, vibe was alright, until he told me maybe we need to face reality of long distanceand other things.

I’ve always been an insecure person and when he kept emphasizing *reality* i bursted out crying and i ended up crying for almost an hour, out of breath. But he was too, there was this moment that he can’t help himself so he escaped to the bathroom just so i wouldn’t see him crying out loud. But i did hear it, of how he was out of breath like me.

From this i know at least we really love each other and i also told him that i really want us to work out.

But today, he texted him quite a bit less than before so i asked him if everything’s alright, he said he’s hungover and tired. And he said he’s worried about me, for being too attached to him that if one day he leaves me i’d be too traumatized and even ruin my own life. So he’s trying to let me withdraw. He also said things like he think he would *eventually kill himself* because of all those issues, and they are getting worse every year and he doesn’t know if he can handle it.

I cried again, but instead this time i couldn’t cry in his arms and feel his firm hugs, and everything of this relationship suddenly feels like time bomb right now.

I feel so sad thinking about all these beautiful things have barely started but i already have to prepare to be losing them, it really breaks my heart.

I tried to put myself into his shoes, i know i can’t help him because it’s actually not about me but himself. He does love me, so he wants me to be less sad if bad things really happen one day.

I really don’t know what to do right now. Unlike other crisis, this one makes me feel really weak, and my heart hurts everytime just by thinking about it.

All i ask for right now, is that he can live on long as he can, even if he loves someone else after me, even if we couldn’t be together.

,SuicideWatch,"Sorry if my english is not good, I’m european. I don't usually write personal things on Reddit but I really need to get this out because I have no one.

I was with my ex for 4 years, until February this year. I'm 28 (almost 29) and she's 32. These 4 years we always had a good time and we did a lot of things together. We shared a lot of interests: anime, video games, love of animals, volleyball. We attended the same volleyball team and over the course of these 4 years her friends also became mine; I have never had many friends, in fact practically none, whereas with them I had found a group of emotionally intelligent, funny people with whom, together with her, we met to role-play every weekend. 

Then in the last year the situation started to go badly.
For a variety of reasons related to our respective situations at home, she no longer came to my house, and I no longer went to her house. Specifically, I no longer went to her house because her retired mother was always there smoking and we didn't have a shred of privacy, she didn't come to me because my house was always either too cold in the winter or too hot in the winter. summer, because while studying at university I didn't have the money to pay the heating or air conditioning bills.

The problem was that she simply seemed to have accepted the fact that we could only see each other once a week, on the weekend, and only with our (her) friends. The more I asked for a solution to be able to carve out time for ourselves too, the more she told me that, due to the situation at our homes, this was not possible. Punctually when I brought up this topic we argued, because I seemed insistent, and it seemed absurd to me that she considered a relationship based only on this.

Sex was gone.
We went from doing it less and less, to doing it once every month and a half/two, until we didn't do it anymore from June last year until November. 

She just didn't seem to feel the need to spend time alone with me. We saw each other either at volleyball, or with her friends.

In November last year, after yet another argument, we took a break, in which we continued to see each other only as friends doing the usual things, that is, seeing each other at volleyball and on Saturday evenings at our friends' house.
During this break I thought a lot about the situation, and I was ready to change to start again for the better, but in February she instead told me that she no longer wanted to continue, and that if I wanted at most we could just remain friends, because being together as a couple it made her feel bad.

This thing literally broke me open and made me a non-functioning human being.

I loved this girl and I still love her, I wanted to build a life and have children together.

I left the volleyball team and the group of friends because hearing or seeing her again made me feel too bad, so now I'm completely alone. 
I have no friends, I have no family, I have no girlfriend, I have nothing. 
I see a psychologist every two weeks but it isn't helping me at all. 

Since February I have done nothing but work, come home and stay in bed, I no longer function as a human being. All I do is think about what I could have done better to prevent her from leaving me. I'm eating out of regulation and staying in bed all day. I finish work (remote work), I throw myself into bed, stare at the PC until late at night and start a new day like this, uninterruptedly, since February.
At almost 30 years old I feel completely finished.

Yesterday I indirectly discovered that she is seeing another person.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

My partner also gets frustrated when they have the baby and the baby cries or can’t settle. I’ve explained that this is just the baby right now and we have to take the good with the bad. 
I finally asked my partner what I could do to make things easier or better, because I cannot handle walking on eggshells when they won’t communicate with me. My partner said that it sounds like I want it to end because I do everything and they do nothing. I never said that and I never said I wanted it to end, but that is their go to Everytime I try to voice a concern. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have no money of my own, the house is mine but I couldn’t afford the mortgage alone right now, let alone the rest of the bills and stuff for my child. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this ends, I will have my partner take the baby to their family’s to visit and I will kill myself. It seems like the easiest solution and then I’d be out of this misery. I love my child but I cannot live life like this. I just want it all to end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sorry, I know this is a jumbled mess, I’m just at a loss. I feel helpless and hopeless. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I (15 year old female) have been feeling this way for a while now. I’ve been struggling with my toxic mental health for a long time now and nobody around me seems to care about me at all. My mum always just shrugs off everything I say to her yet tells me I can go to her for literally anything. My dad’s worse tho he always shouts at me and tries to manipulate and gaslight me into thinking I’m a bad person every single chance he gets. Tho, he’s not exactly wrong about that I’m not a good person I’m a worthless bed rotter who watches g0r3 in my spare time and wishes I was the person dying in the video. Disgusting right? yeah ik. My sister hates me too she treats me like I’m a weirdo and always acts like everything I say is stupid which makes me feel stupid yk? Not only that I once ran away because I had another argument with my parents and I tried to kill myself. The first time I ran away that night I had a knife with me but, I wasn’t fast enough and they caught up to me and forced me to go back home. They didn’t even care about me they just said I was “making a scene.” The second time I ran away I couldn’t take a knife with me cause my parents prevented me from getting to the draw with the knives in it so I left without one. My plan that time was to just keep running until I found another way I could end my life like jumping into the canal and drowning myself. Well, long story short I got brought back home that time too cause the police were called. It was strange tho cause I didn’t feel scared or worried about getting in trouble with the police when I had to talk to them I felt comforted like I was finally being listened to. I felt attracted to the policeman that was talking to me like he was the first man in my life to ever be a good man to me. It was amazing. But, he left eventually and the feeling I had left with him it was so disappointing. But, I’m not gonna mess up this time. I’m planning to run away again very soon not sure when but I’ll figure it out soon. Except, this time I’m gonna take my mum’s car instead of running.

I’ve been struggling with my toxic mental health for a long time now and nobody around me seems to care about me at all. My mum always just shrugs off everything I say to her yet tells me I can go to her for literally anything. My dad’s worse tho he always shouts at me and tries to manipulate and gaslight me into thinking I’m a bad person every single chance he gets. Tho, he’s not exactly wrong about that I’m not a good person I’m a worthless bed rotter who watches g0r3 in my spare time and wishes I was the person dying in the video. Disgusting right? yeah ik. My sister hates me too she treats me like I’m a weirdo and always acts like everything I say is stupid which makes me feel stupid yk? Not only that I once ran away because I had another argument with my parents and I tried to kill myself. The first time I ran away that night I had a knife with me but, I wasn’t fast enough and they caught up to me and forced me to go back home. They didn’t even care about me they just said I was “making a scene.” The second time I ran away I couldn’t take a knife with me cause my parents prevented me from getting to the draw with the knives in it so I left without one. My plan that time was to just keep running until I found another way I could end my life like jumping into the canal and drowning myself. Well, long story short I got brought back home that time too cause the police were called. It was strange tho cause I didn’t feel scared or worried about getting in trouble with the police when I had to talk to them I felt comforted like I was finally being listened to. I felt attracted to the policeman that was talking to me like he was the first man in my life to ever be a good man to me. It was amazing. But, he left eventually and the feeling I had left with him it was so disappointing. But, I’m not gonna mess up this time. I’m planning to run away again very soon not sure when but I’ll figure it out soon. Except, this time I’m gonna take my mum’s car instead of running. I’m gonna crash the car with so much force that my death won’t even feel real. I can just imagine the cold air on my skin and the illuminating traffic lights as I drive. Then BOOM I crash and all my pain comes to a much deserved end. &lt;/p&gt;

Hii im \[20, F\] actually thinking about commiting bcs i feel my life has come to the point where i cannot keep going. Ill explain, i had an extremely sad and rough life which has caused me trauma and personality disorders such as bpd. I was s3xually abus3d as a child (cocsa) and as a teenager by older teenagers. This led to several identity issues for me with my sexuality. i became fixated on sex by age 6, which only made my situation worse as i would try to have sex with people and the only people who would have me were pdf files.  I became exposed to pdf files and pdf file p0rn by some of my abusers by age 13. my mouth was r4ped at that age and i developed an oral fixation. I became addicted to smoking cigarettes and marijuana, also took a bunch of drugs and acohol during my teenage years, as one does, and i developed an addiction to benzos. i started to sell pics of myself to pay for my addiction. This benzo addiction kept going until i was 18 and my family sent me to rehab. I recovered and had to be put on medication for my issues. abilify and prozac, i take them to this day. I also had an ED during my adolescence and self harm issues. I am now recovered but i ache greatly as i want to feel how i felt before, i felt alive. I have gained like 40 kgs since my ed and i wish i could go back to how my body was since i no longer find myself cute or fuckable. i dont go outside anymore, i dont have “friends“ to “hang out with”, i have a psychiatrist and psychologist but nobody else to talk to. I only stay at home and play online (Dont have online friends either). I am extremely unbearable in relationships so nobody will put up with me, i am also ugly so its hard enough. should i just off myself as i am clearly in for a long life of suffering? My memory will not cease and i cannot forget how good having friends and taking drugs felt, or how greatly being loved by someone feels like. i still havent finished school yet because im a loser who failed chemestry and its been years since. should i just kms?

It was smooth sailing for the first week, chill, no drama, but since the group found out abt us being together, they aint happy.

She then called the cops and they said it wasn't S/A, for a valid reason which both of us had overlooked. We then apologised to the group, and she left me on her own accord, which i accepted.

Sure the last bit was my fault; the group hates me and her now. I feel that it was all 100% my fault, even though i was only trying to pass the message on.

that being said, my relationship with my SO is great, i love him a lot, he’s usually affectionate and appreciative of me.

but then he gets in these moods. he’s got depression that tends to come and go. when he’s depressed he blames me for every problem that HE caused in our relationship.

he cheated on me (if you can call it that, he stayed texting random bitches who live across the country from us) … we fought a LOT about it but stayed together. he’s shown me he’s sorry, and he’s the one who came out and told me about it on his own. i didn’t find it or nothing.

his problem with all that though is that i was “so angry” and when he’s depressed he says he thinks about it and can’t let it go. i understand that, i slapped him as hard as i could across the face. but fuck man, how would you respond?

oh, and the fact that his mom and family found out about this and hate ME??? not for the slap, i don’t know if they even know about it. because i was so angry at him even though i stayed with him. i was angry so i said a lot of hurtful shit. i get that. i fucked up.

but he always acts like we’re past it when he’s happy. couples go through shit, right?

i really have no purpose if not for him. all i do it work, cook food for him (i’ve realized that’s my love language) and try and help him with his dream career. he works a more physical job while working on his career on the side. the only chore i ask him to do is the dishes. we both are working now to save up money, he said once i’m pregnant and i can stop working if i want and he’ll provide. i’m happy with that.

but right now he’s in one of those depressed moods. and i’m feeling it right now too. more than normal. i know this will pass like every other time. but i’m so tired, man…

I have no desire to work, eat or actually LIVE, you know? I've been passively suicidal for about 7 years, going on 8 years in roughly a month and I'd usually cry, think about dying, maybe some SH and then I'd go to bed but tonight.. somethings different. I literally just had a cry but it only lasted like 5mins or so and now I'm completely neutral.

,SuicideWatch,"Years ago I first started developing depression and anxiety symptoms due to bullying and stress in school, mainly due to being neurodivergent. It made my life a living hell because I had no friends and my own family would call me r3tarded or say I was “acting dramatic” if I tried to open up. If I showed any deeper symptoms, they’d tell me I’d get locked up in “The Loony Bin” where I’d be strapped down to a bed and pumped full of pills like a slave. Hearing that was already terrifying enough, but to hear very real and very similar incidents happen to people I knew didn’t make it any better.

None of them know this, but I almost went through with overdosing one night in the 7th grade due to a humiliating incident that turned out to be my breaking point. For whatever reason, I just couldn’t go through with it. Maybe it was my dog or my few online mutuals on PopJam, but instead, I just cried myself to sleep and foolishly hoped that I wouldn’t wake up the next morning. I had a similar incident due to an ex, but that was less severe I think. 

My family would always tell me that “depression was temporary and it’ll go away on its own” but it never did for me.

Years later those thoughts just became passive. I didn’t want to kill myself, but at the same time I didn’t care what happened to me anymore. I didn’t care if I got kidnapped, or got run over, or anything like that. As long as it was quick I wouldn’t mind. There were times I would walk on bridges and have intrusive thoughts about jumping off. 

Even when going through diagnosis stuff and even when some people asked, I could never tell the full truth that I had suicidal thoughts. The idea of being abused, assaulted and cut off from the rest of the world in a closed facility was a concept worse than death to me. Even prisoners had more rights than that. It was essentially a punishment for not getting the job done yourself, run by people that only saw broken individuals as trash to be repurposed instead of fixed.

But I’m tired of living in mental exhaustion everyday, waiting for something else to kill me. I’m tired of not knowing what I want to do with myself one day and feeling like I’m just a useless background character in everyone else’s life. I actually have a few people I care about and want to stay for. But I don’t want to keep living like this anymore and I don’t know how to change the way I feel.

It made my life a living hell because I had no friends and my own family would call me r3tarded or say I was “acting dramatic” if I tried to open up. If I showed any deeper symptoms, they’d tell me I’d get locked up in “The Loony Bin” where I’d be strapped down to a bed and pumped full of pills like a slave. Hearing that was already terrifying enough, but to hear very real and very similar incidents happen to people I knew didn’t make it any better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of them know this, but I almost went through with overdosing one night in the 7th grade due to a humiliating incident that turned out to be my breaking point. For whatever reason, I just couldn’t go through with it. Maybe it was my dog or my few online mutuals on PopJam, but instead, I just cried myself to sleep and foolishly hoped that I wouldn’t wake up the next morning. I had a similar incident due to an ex, but that was less severe I think. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My family would always tell me that “depression was temporary and it’ll go away on its own” but it never did for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years later those thoughts just became passive. I didn’t want to kill myself, but at the same time I didn’t care what happened to me anymore. I didn’t care if I got kidnapped, or got run over, or anything like that. As long as it was quick I wouldn’t mind. There were times I would walk on bridges and have intrusive thoughts about jumping off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even when going through diagnosis stuff and even when some people asked, I could never tell the full truth that I had suicidal thoughts. The idea of being abused, assaulted and cut off from the rest of the world in a closed facility was a concept worse than death to me. Even prisoners had more rights than that. It was essentially a punishment for not getting the job done yourself, run by people that only saw broken individuals as trash to be repurposed instead of fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m tired of living in mental exhaustion everyday, waiting for something else to kill me. I’m tired of not knowing what I want to do with myself one day and feeling like I’m just a useless background character in everyone else’s life. I actually have a few people I care about and want to stay for. But I don’t want to keep living like this anymore and I don’t know how to change the way I feel. I’ve tried getting out more and getting into hobbies but they’re never permanent solutions to the pain. I want to tell someone so maybe they’ll finally understand why I am the way I am. But I don’t want to risk being tortured if I say the wrong thing or too much. If anyone has any advice, I’d appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I just want to state I'm doing okay in terms of a place to work and a house to stay at. I'd say I'm dealing with less stress than the average person working in the US. The issue is I'm breaking mentally when I thought I overcame some of my biggest problems that held me down. I use to deal with a lot of depression and anxiety. It held me back horribly and I tormented myself In the past thinking how the way people treat me I must deserve to suffer. I thought that maybe I had done something so horrible in a past life that I absolutely deserved the hurtful things friends would do to me. I'd lay in night crying about how I would be better off if I had disappeared and the only thing that stopped me was not wanting to end my life just out right sense who knows where you go and what damage I would cause to people finding out I killed myself. Even my family treated me horrible as a kid I know I was not raised well. I wasn't raised horribly but I still went through stuff that caused me to develop how I felt about how I deserved to suffer. I know it was what caused my anxiety. Even back then when I expressed my severe panic attacks no one tried to help. They even found out I was cutting cause I tried getting help through a suicide hotline who just threw cops my way so I had to get cuffed and sent to a mental hospital. Explains why I don't go there for help anymore.

Of course I no longer face this exact challenge of hating myself. I actually have grown to accept the things I like and and who I am. I have bought things I like to look at like art and just stuff that would help me. Ultimately I begun taking care of myself and loving myself. With all of this it was very impowering I felt good about life. The last time I felt depression/anxiety was 5 months ago when my bestfriend who I talked to everyday for a year started ghosting me. She had moved back home and shortly after the energy we equally put in started halting. I gave it time thinking oh she just wants to be with family for a bit. A month passed. I had grown to hold a lot of anxiety and concern the friendship was ending. I expressed my feelings of how ever sense she moved back home I felt I wasn't someone she liked anymore. Like I was just used to pass the time she was away from home. I only received deflections and how my comment hurt her. I was just shocked.

What made all of this worse is I had just helped this friend get a new pc with a good amount of money. Money I was anxious to spend but there were no issues in the friendship prior. We always worked things out we always played games and did voice chat. When she needed someone to vent to I tried to be there for her. I gave her advice helped her away from bad friends. Showed her how to be more positive and get through work. I put so much into it and I loved it. That friend felt like a sister to me that I didn't have. Just like that though I was no longer even a thought to them. They said they would pay me back first. They ended up paying others back first. I asked them about it. They said how I told them they could take their time. I did. Though there was absolutely desire being shown to pay me back. 2-3 months in no money was given back. I was dying over this. I spent a year with this person almost daily sharing so much. Now I'm not only not worth talking to but I'm not even worth getting the money back that I so kindheartedly loaned. Remembering hearing how she looked up to me so much. Hearing how I helped so much. So I guess it wasn't meant at all. Or they liked my actions but not me as a person. Eventually I had looked into stuff and my mind switched. I was done treating myself bad over all the stuff that went wrong.

I started taking care of myself and buying things for myself. It honestly didn't feel as good but I know it was helping and after sometime I realized how horrible those close friends were to me. So I started trying to better determine my friends and started a goal of staying out of friendships that had drama. Anyone who I had issues with I put a long stick between us at the very least. This horrible event at least gave me room to treat myself better. Then it started. I started realizing how sickening it was for people to treat such a sweet person like that. To selfishly use me like that. Use me as a wallet. Use me for emotional validation. Use me to fill in their boredom. Most of the closest people hurt me the most. Said some of the most vial things I had heard. It all ended on such bad terms. It made me question if I should have anymore close friends. Shortly after someone who I considered a friend started trying to make me mad. I knew what they were doing cause they started instigating things. They even expressed how they were trying to instigate. I can't just leave this friend because a good friend hangout with him. I'd have to leave as a whole.

All of these little details all of these little actions that I saw in people. I saw how sickening we are as Humans. We steal from people who love us. We use them like tools. We do anything to make ourselves feel better even if it means someone dies. What was unbearable an amount of depression and anxiety is now an unbearable amounts of anger building up more and more. I knew how everyone close to me treated me so disgusting. No one sacrificed anything for me. No one did anything that was at their inconvenience. No one in this world wants to be understanding. No one wants to put in the same effort all the time. My friend group is getting smaller and smaller. I don't make anymore friends. So it just seems like a painful process of me losing all my friends in some disgusting way eventually and I'd have no way of know sense most just switched up on me. Where they take advantage of me or use me in any kind of way. Where at the end of it my health is never a concern to them. Its disgusting how much stuff I dealt with that was horrible as someone with such a big heart.

Now I don't know who to trust anymore. I don't know whos going to toy with me next. I know I can't make any friends not that I don't talk to people but because I'm such a different person from everyone else. My interests are niche and very few people ever know them. No one really gets my way of joking a lot and Im so spastic. I have a lot of energy and I just act dumb because its fun. I don't hate me for this but I know the way I am doesn't bring anyone in which as a human is making me feel very lonely. So while I'm losing people there is absolutely no one showing up in life. I'm growing up and I know less and less people will like my way of joking and interests. Its just saddening cause I use to love people and I wanted to give someone the most a human could. I wanted to experience true love. The closer I got to this it felt like life was stabbing me in the most painful way it could. People I thought I knew who lured me in only to use me and throw me away.

So despite wanting to love people and care for people and help I now Just feel so much disgust and hatred. I'm so full of anger and it gets worse everyday. I stay physically active to hopefully burn off this anger but I can still feel it there. Even if I manage to get it out of my mind during it comes back. Its just there. I'm so disgusted by what Human do. It feels like truly humanity was never full of love. It was never a place with good people. I just hate how no one cares. Whats the point. Whats my purpose. I just want to say fuck it and leave everything. I don't want to deal with this shit anymore. Getting close to someone just means a big chance at me getting screwed over in some way. I don't know how to feel or what to do now. everything is just feeling worse. I just feel like blowing my brains out. There is no good here. I won't even feel that happiness i did from friends in anything else and I've been trying. I want to be happy but I can't find anything to distract me away from this anger like those friendships did. I love my hobbies and interests but I'm not a fueled to them. At least when i do them yes I enjoy it but this anger comes back.

I'm so sick of it. Its tormenting. You think you make it into a peaceful happy life then either someone or life itself kicks you down as soon as you get better. I just don't want to be here anymore. Not even cause I hate myself. I actually want myself to be okay so just imagining ending it all being free from this painful headache. From all the sickening humans out there. That sounds lovely. Its sound like that would be the only thing I'd have to finally put my mind at rest. No more emotions that take over my life. It would be fine if I could be okay for a whole year without breaking down so bad like this. But i don't ever get that. Sense 13 my like has just felt like shit. I don't know how to feel anymore. Yeah maybe I can ride this out but ya know when you actively snap into a positive mindset finally and then anger comes along to kick it out. Well whats the point. All of that work is gone. Its obviously impacting my friendships and even work. I can't talk to people when the thought of blowing my head of is in my mind or when the crippling disgust of all the horrible things people have done to me is catching up. I'm just so annoyed now. I haven't hurt anyone but I've just stopped showing up. Only 2 fucking people would care about where I am and the other would be concerned about me.

Well I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't really have anyone to go to with this. Its funny I wanna give up on Humanity and stop relying on people but I'm here. I just want peace really. Also if anyone is concerned please don't have police show up again. That actually caused me to lose a lot of trust too. Maybe I'm just paranoid now cause how would they tap my stuff on here but whos knows. Just send the police to deal with the guy who needs comfort and care. I know it would be expecting a lot for some to read and respond sense nothing is ever really free but yeah. Well thanks if anyone does.

,SuicideWatch,"What I can’t understand is how people have such strong feelings. They have the motivation to get up, to feed and clothe and wash themselves, to go to a job, to heal themselves when they’re ill. And the people who are suicidal - they feel hate towards themselves, or the world, or sadness.

I just feel nothing. I look at the world and I just think what is inspiring about that. I have no idea why the average person gets up in the morning because I am one of them and none of this feels worth trying for to me. It all just feels so pointless - it’s so much effort to stay alive and for what exactly? A boring world full of boring mundane days and tasks, the same social interactions over and over. I just don’t care? 

I feel like people expect depression to be strong feelings of sadness but I wish I could feel that because I don’t even gaf enough to look after myself. I just think the world is overrated in the same way you might look at a supermarket offer and think “not good value for money”.

I have no idea why the average person gets up in the morning because I am one of them and none of this feels worth trying for to me. It all just feels so pointless - it’s so much effort to stay alive and for what exactly? A boring world full of boring mundane days and tasks, the same social interactions over and over. I just don’t care? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like people expect depression to be strong feelings of sadness but I wish I could feel that because I don’t even gaf enough to look after myself. I just think the world is overrated in the same way you might look at a supermarket offer and think “not good value for money”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m alive for my family but that’s their feelings, not mine - I think staying alive for the potential of a few specific happy moments is just illogical when the rest are shit. &lt;/p&gt;

I just hate my life so much, I hate myself, my environment and everything else too. I'm 20 (f) and have been depressed since I was 14, have very bad social anxiety ever since I could remember &amp; to top it off I am autistic. 

these days, the only thing that really makes me happy is smoking weed &amp; occasionally taking other drugs. I've just started a new job &amp; even though I'm proud of myself for finally doing something with my life (I graduated 3 years ago) I hate myself for being so stupid and anxious at work. I lay in bed all day, scrolling on tik tok or instagram, distracting myself from living. I don't have any friends &amp; I do have a boyfriend, but I'm not that happy when I'm with him either. besides work I don't do ANYTHING and it's frustrating me because I can't get myself to do anything. why am I so lazy?? I'm literally burnt out from doing nothing all day. I have a gym membership but I never go cause my anxiety is just way too high. 

I do hate my body &amp; I wish I could bring myself to go to the gym, but I don't eat enough. I even hate eating, it feels like a chore and nothing that I enjoy anymore. I hate how I look, especially my body, since I don't really eat much I'm way too thin and almost look sick. I've spent such a long time trying to love myself, at one point I just decided to give up. I feel like I am so ugly &amp; even though people tell me that I'm not, I'm so self conscious of myself. I feel like even how I'm walking is wrong, I hate my posture and my teeth, I hate how I dress &amp; I don't have any money to buy myself nice things. I compare myself to so many beautiful women online &amp; know that I'll never be happy with my looks. 
it doesn't matter how many times I change my hair, change my make up, my personality, I still always end up hating myself. 

I also have a pretty sad home life. both of my parents don't work, growing up we never had any money &amp; sometimes there wasn't even enough money for food. I have 5 siblings, 2 of whom I don't speak to. my parents have a lot of debt, even making debt in my name. as a child I also saw the police at home often, since my father did a lot of illegal things. at home it's always dirty, since my mom never cleans &amp; my siblings don't really care either. I'm the only one who's always cleaning, but I don't get appreciated &amp; I don't want to tidy up anymore. I would do anything to get out of here since I also have to share a room with my 2 sisters, but I don't have enough money. 

I don't have any hobbies, I hate everything and I regret not killing myself when I was 16 and still had the guts to do it. now I'm just slowly rotting away day by day. I wake up nauseous every day due to my anxiety, I've had sleeping problems since forever and I also have migraines almost everyday. I feel like my body will give up on its own slowly. 

I've tried finding my way to god, but I didn't feel better. I even tried manifestation and spirituality but nothing fucking works. I've tried waking up early, sleeping 8 hours or 4 hours is no difference, everyday I wake up tired of life. I want to go outside when I'm inside &amp; I always want to go home when I'm outside. I don't belong anywhere, I don't know who I am. everyday I look into the mirror and don't know who I'm looking at, it's like I'm a stranger to myself. I lost my teenage years to depression &amp; now I'm 20 and will never get those years back. I don't even know why I'm writing this right now, or if anyone will even read through this, but I just feel so alone and like life is a chore. 
maybe I should start therapy, but where I life it's impossible to find a therapist. I just want to life like everyone else, I don't want to be me anymore. I live in a constant state of stress, but I can't even cry anymore, I haven't cried in months even though I'm so miserable. 

I don't want to die, but I feel like I don't belong here. I feel like an outsider &amp; my autism only makes it harder for me to live. when I'll die someday, I hope everyone regrets how they treated me.

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t want to die, but I feel like I don&amp;#39;t belong here. I feel like an outsider &amp;amp; my autism only makes it harder for me to live. when I&amp;#39;ll die someday, I hope everyone regrets how they treated me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;will I ever be okay?&lt;/p&gt;

Prior, I spent a better part of a decade to get better and found solace in family, I've never been happier or as content with life less than a month ago.

When that all came crashing down, they tried to hide my guns and asked if I needed to go somewhere for awhile to sort myself out but I couldn't leave what was left of my family to grieve without me.

,SuicideWatch,"Basically as it suggests\~ I'm a 21 year old (F) who has struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a preteen. This is my first and I hope only boyfriend but I feel my own mental health struggles are causing a rift in our relationship. He has told me he resents me for the times i've gotten irrationally mad at him. I can see where he comes from and when i'm overstimulated or overwhelmed I don't handle it well, plain and simple I can be a bit of a b\*tch. On top of all this, my mood changes so rapidly he feels he has to walk on eggshells sometimes, I get in depressive moods which tell me that I don't deserve love and I don't deserve him. 

Further, I feel sometimes I wish i'd die or be murdered so he could let go of me (of a future with me) because all I want is for him to be happy. Although it would break me, its worth letting him go so he can be happier, more fulfilled, and appreciated in a relationship than he is now with me. I feel he deserves so much more than what I am giving him and I would die just to do that. I have told him on occasion these exact thoughts which has left him emotionally numb. I can tell that he has grown tired of this constant narrative of mine, he often tells me to ""just not"", and I sense I have caused him emotional trauma since he rarely and typically refuses to express his emotions with me anymore. 

I hold so much guilt for the pain I have caused him and I wish he would focus his attention towards someone more worthy of his unconditional love. 

I have gone to years of therapy on and off, I contextualize and intellectualize my emotions so much that I always feel multiple emotions at once in a given situation and fall into depressive patterns such as these whenever a stressor is present (intense uni schedule or narcissistic mom).

I could tell she was feeling down. She has lost a lot of weight since I saw her. I noticed she developed an ED and tried my best to make her eat more. 
Yesterday I went on Snapchat and saw her story she made about her healing journey from depression.
Turns out, she's been extremely depressed and self harming. According to her this is not the first attempt but the 32nd.
As I was scrolling through I felt like a failure for not recognising the obvious signs. And at the end of her story she said she relapsed again and goodbye for the last time.
She sent me s snap of her arm attached to an IV (I saw this before her Snapchat story) I called her several times she didn't pick up.
She just replied to me that she's hospitalised for attempt and that she'll call me later.

I have no idea what to say to her to help her. We are separated by cities and I don't think her parents know about it. I'm scared to tell them because it will feel like I'm breaking her trust and sharing something she doesn't want to share.

I get angry at myself for having even a sliver of hope that someone will pick up on my behaviour but I’m the one who pushes everything back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to see my therapist on Monday, it’s too embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not supposed to die before them, yet I’m staring at this rack of pills, and I haven’t even said goodbye to everyone properly yet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t anyone’s fault. This wasn’t anyone’s fault. I’m the one falling short. I can’t pull myself out of this, no matter how much I try, I’m stuck in this pathetic state alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time I was warded, my dad told me that it would crush him for me to leave him. He was down the entire time but he kept trying to smile at me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And after I got discharged he would make a big fuss whenever there was any sort of sharp object or pill bottle around me and hide it when I was around like I was some sort of fucking psycho. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It feels easier to go silently than to tell them and have them try to stop me when they can’t get into my head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t slept properly in so long. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I'm going to kill myself and I'd like to post my suicide note here; I have it in writing but I'd like to have it somewhere where it is widely available to read. I'm really sorry and I wish things could be different. I really do.

To Whom It May Concern,

I'd like to start off by saying that what I end up doing was nobody's fault; this was the a decision that was the result of a lot of different factors. I will sum things up by saying that my life was not one that anyone would ever want to live. Sure, bad things happen to everyone--but I am inadequate. In every facet of existence I fall short of the mark. I have no talents, I am alone even when I'm around others, I have no drive to attempt things because I know that I will fail. I used to love writing (it is what is driving me to write this) but I have come to realize that this thing I loved was merely just a way to avoid the loneliness of my reality--the sadness that nothing will get better; I was just as bad at it as everything else unfortunately. I was not made for life. It is a strange statement, but one I know to be true. If I were anyone else I'd be happy and not writing this. Some people are given bad lives, but those people can overcome them and go on to have wonderful lives. I am not one of these people; once I drew that short straw my fate was sealed. Some people are just not meant to be born.

For awhile I thought things were getting better; in 2019 I had a job that I loved, friends that I cared for and that I believe cared for me, and a family situation that was pleasant enough. Right around this time, when things were looking up, the pandemic hit and things became the worst they'd ever been. My job (one in the medical field) fell into chaos and deteriorated my mental state further; eventually we were bought out and I had to quit. My mother also went missing around this time while camping and they have still not found a trace of her. In the aftermath of the pandemic my friends drew away from me and now it is as if I do not exist to them. I wanted to go to school, but this too the pandemic prevented. If this had not happened I think things could have been bearable for a little while longer.

Every day that I lived was a trail and I was always overcome with a sense of loneliness and despair. I felt that life was a prison and I didn't know how to escape or why I was even in this prison. Some people may ask what my problems were or offered advice, but this could never help in anyway because they could not understand what I feel every day--they did not have to endure the pain that life caused me. It was never about the problems--not at its core; these only served to heighten this pain. The only time I ever felt free was when I was sleeping, only there was I free of the pain, in my dreams. Dreams of a better existence, surrounded by people that wanted me around, of experiences I could never have in the waking world. My sleep was a reality of love, of warmth and belonging, and it is my hope that I'll return there in a more permanent capacity. That was the only place that my hopes were made manifest. You may not understand anything I'm saying, nothing I'm describing, and if that's the case then it is good news! Because you are not feeling what I am feeling and I am very glad for that.

I'm sure I sound crazy, but no therapist could have helped, even if I could have afforded it (which I could not). I understand the function of SSRIs and of the chemical imbalance that occurs in those with depression. I do not have depression, these medications would not have worked; what I had was a terminal outlook on life and a ceaseless soul-crushing anguish. There are people like me who cannot be helped, no matter how hard you try: it is an effort in futility. Please know that no amount of help could have changed my decision, and please do not blame yourselves for this, because it was well out of your control.

I could ask for your forgiveness, but a complete waste like me does not deserve it. I understand if you hate me, that is something I do deserve. I've tried to better myself, I've tried to help others, but nothing I do truly matters. I'm just so tired of everything. I know that I'm leaving a lot of stuff behind, just do with it as you please, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience that this causes you. For that, I am a horrible person.

I&amp;#39;m really sorry and I wish things could be different. I really do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Whom It May Concern,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d like to start off by saying that what I end up doing was nobody&amp;#39;s fault; this was the a decision that was the result of a lot of different factors. I will sum things up by saying that my life was not one that anyone would ever want to live. Sure, bad things happen to everyone--but I am inadequate. In every facet of existence I fall short of the mark. I have no talents, I am alone even when I&amp;#39;m around others, I have no drive to attempt things because I know that I will fail. I used to love writing (it is what is driving me to write this) but I have come to realize that this thing I loved was merely just a way to avoid the loneliness of my reality--the sadness that nothing will get better; I was just as bad at it as everything else unfortunately. I was not made for life. It is a strange statement, but one I know to be true. If I were anyone else I&amp;#39;d be happy and not writing this. Some people are given bad lives, but those people can overcome them and go on to have wonderful lives. I am not one of these people; once I drew that short straw my fate was sealed. Some people are just not meant to be born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For awhile I thought things were getting better; in 2019 I had a job that I loved, friends that I cared for and that I believe cared for me, and a family situation that was pleasant enough. Right around this time, when things were looking up, the pandemic hit and things became the worst they&amp;#39;d ever been. My job (one in the medical field) fell into chaos and deteriorated my mental state further; eventually we were bought out and I had to quit. My mother also went missing around this time while camping and they have still not found a trace of her. In the aftermath of the pandemic my friends drew away from me and now it is as if I do not exist to them. I wanted to go to school, but this too the pandemic prevented. If this had not happened I think things could have been bearable for a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every day that I lived was a trail and I was always overcome with a sense of loneliness and despair. I felt that life was a prison and I didn&amp;#39;t know how to escape or why I was even in this prison. Some people may ask what my problems were or offered advice, but this could never help in anyway because they could not understand what I feel every day--they did not have to endure the pain that life caused me. It was never about the problems--not at its core; these only served to heighten this pain. The only time I ever felt free was when I was sleeping, only there was I free of the pain, in my dreams. Dreams of a better existence, surrounded by people that wanted me around, of experiences I could never have in the waking world.

Here's my original message:

I don't really feel like explaining my whole life story right now, just know it's really only getting worse.  To put it simply, I've lost basically all my friends.  I've lost my dog and my girlfriend.  My parents seem so unhappy with their lives as adults, and I really just don't enjoy life anymore.

On top of that, the world is a crazy shitshow and I really don't understand what the point in living is.  What great reason is there to go on?  For love?  I highly doubt with my mentally unstable self, I will ever find someone who loves me unconditionally.  For money? Yeah I ain't gonna be wealthy either, my parents are having a hard enough time just paying rent let alone groceries and helping me with school or trying to get me diagnosed and forget paying for any medication.  For fun? Nothings fun about this world.  Terrible people continue to run free from any guilt and any problems.  I've seen so many bad people get away with things and see no repercussions, and I try my best to be loyal and respectful to everyone (admittedly I fail for sure) but I try to be nice and I get the short end of the stick for trying to be a decent person.  

I'm convinced there's no good reason I should stay in this world, what logical sensical reasoning is there for enduring any more years of this?  I've lost so much and I don't want to throw myself a pity party, but everything's terrible.  My life has nothing going for it, no bright future, I'm not smart, I have a screwed up brain, living in a world where nobody cares about me, there's seriously no reason to keep going.

I don't know why I keep going, I guess part of me still has hope but I really think it would be better if I was dead.  The only ""enjoyment"" I get out of life is playing video games and half the time I don't even like playing games they're only a coping mechanism.  I always feel lonely no matter what anyone says.

I just don't know if I have the strength to wait that long.

I just want to go to college. I don't want to have kids, I don't want to have a house someday, I don't even dream of having a nice car. I just to want to pursue a PhD man

I just want to go to school

Why do I hate other people so much? Why do I hate myself so much? Why am I getting worse *after* I pursue treatment? Why does ""getting a better idea of how I'm feeling"" just make things more painful and confusing?

I just want to go to school. I struggle to read now, I struggle to even eat or sleep if people don't remind me, but I am a master of acting completely fucking fine if anyone else asks. Forget high functioning, I'm high performative, and I can't stop acting...

I miss drugs. All they do is provide fresh new ways for me to experience self-hatred

Feels like self-harming is the only classic coping mechanism I haven't tried yet. Don't even have the courage to break the fucking meat puppet, but I'm so good at commanding it to pretend it's working. I try to tell people I don't know how to live anymore, but they're not seeing the bigger picture. Why is it so hard to figure out?? Who could be fucking happy with this world???

I don't even know how I can justify dreaming of a PhD.

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t know if I have the strength to wait that long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to go to college. I don&amp;#39;t want to have kids, I don&amp;#39;t want to have a house someday, I don&amp;#39;t even dream of having a nice car. I just to want to pursue a PhD man&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to go to school&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do I hate other people so much? Why do I hate myself so much? Why am I getting worse &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; I pursue treatment? Why does &amp;quot;getting a better idea of how I&amp;#39;m feeling&amp;quot; just make things more painful and confusing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want to go to school. I struggle to read now, I struggle to even eat or sleep if people don&amp;#39;t remind me, but I am a master of acting completely fucking fine if anyone else asks. Forget high functioning, I&amp;#39;m high performative, and I can&amp;#39;t stop acting...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I miss drugs. All they do is provide fresh new ways for me to experience self-hatred&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feels like self-harming is the only classic coping mechanism I haven&amp;#39;t tried yet. Don&amp;#39;t even have the courage to break the fucking meat puppet, but I&amp;#39;m so good at commanding it to pretend it&amp;#39;s working. I try to tell people I don&amp;#39;t know how to live anymore, but they&amp;#39;re not seeing the bigger picture. Why is it so hard to figure out?? Who could be fucking happy with this world???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know how I can justify dreaming of a PhD. I have to finish my degree, I have to work and save, I have at least a master&amp;#39;s and a doctoral program after that . . . that&amp;#39;s hundreds of thousands of dollars and years and years and years and I don&amp;#39;t know how to feed myself even with more money than I need&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I feel very lonely, with no real activities apart from work. My debts consume most of my money. A year ago, the stress, depression, and frustration from not finding a job in my field despite having a degree, combined with the three-year struggle to get off a toxic job, the death tought who came back, and Hearing people complain about having a good life was difficult. I finally left a toxic job for a non-toxic that didn’t suit me. All of this piled up, and I cut off all contact. After three months, I received a few greetings and nothing more (six months later, one of them tried multiple times, but I didn't feel ready With my miserable life, I didn't want to reconnect until I had changed). I told myself that getting only two greetings in all that time showed I wasn't part of the group. most time ignored, I was more like a third wheel in a group of eight people for ten years (that's how I feel it).

Later, in November, a friend from another city came to mine and tried to get back on my feet. I engaged in activities, went out, tried dating apps, and had one date (I was super happy because, at my age (M27), it was my first date, despite many opportunities before). But the date was one-sided; she said yes but without enthusiasm, and I clung to it, seeking some love, though it was pointless. This improvement was short-lived. In January, I tried to enjoy my passion for photography, forced myself to improve, and reconnected with former colleagues and friends, though one had manipulative tendencies. I saw him as a male figure, in quotes. However, every time I posted a photo, he would call me on every platform possible (at least five calls), send messages everywhere, and leave comments. It was always to ask what was happening (related to the post). As an introvert, I didn’t like it; it made me feel watched 24/7. Another mistake I made was letting someone use my identity to find a job, adding stress at the end of each month because I didn't realize it would be automatically declared. So, I decided to cut connections, and since then, nothing. But my identity is still being used. A few days ago, I asked him via message to stop using it. He replied by sending an image and then deleting it before I could see it. I still have some hope because I changed my ID a few months ago, and the one he uses expires at the end of this month.

I already know that next year I'll owe taxes as if I were rich ( I prefer he stops using my ID and I pay the taxes than say it because if I do that I can lose everything, and I would probably need to fly away that country and never come back) while earning minimum wage with 28% of my salary going to debts each month. The government believes I earned double my actual salary because 2 minimum wages = rich enough. I have no contact with anyone; I feel alone. I have small projects and passions, but I can't motivate myself to pursue them. I wish I could succeed in motivating myself, stop putting myself in danger due to my altruism, make good friends and find a girlfriend in my city, and stop having failures like the rest of my life. I wanted to see a psychiatrist; I had one session but couldn't afford more. It put me in the red, and my employer's insurance is so poor that it doesn't cover what's usually reimbursed in my country, Im waiting for my refund so I can see my psychiatrist.

Every time I'm sad or angry, I remember all the times my mother told me I was useless, that I would never achieve anything, and that she hoped I would fail in life. All the time I stayed home because going out meant spending money for her. All the times I refused to go out with friends because I would be harassed on my phone ten minutes later, being told it was time to come home. Every time one of her acquaintances died, it was my fault. She even told me twice that I was worse than an accident worse than an unwanted, the worst thing that ever happened to her, and that she wished I had never existed. I knew I wasn't wanted but it was hard to hear that as a child, she bought me girls' stuff even though I am a boy. Ironically, she doesn’t like homosexuals! At one point, I believed I was a girl born in a boy's body(10\~\~14y). Around 15y, I started playing online games and met the group I cut off contact with last year. I desperately searched for a way to be loved, a way to forget, like adults drowning their sorrows in alcohol, but for me, it was in games.

I remember around 10 or 11, I wanted to end it. A friend at the time saw me and stopped me. Sometimes I think she shouldn't have intervened.

At 18, I left the country. After that, my mother would tell me she loved me and all, but she always had to remind me in every call that it was my fault for this, my fault for that. She also mentioned who would take care of her once she is too old (actually she is 66y) I suppose it will be my older brother (M38). My mother always called me by my brother’s name. I know she rarely called my brother by my name, but for me, it was all the time. My brother and I didn’t live together much; he lived with his father, and his life has also been pretty bad, but at least he is stronger than I am. And anyway, our last text was fine and you, fine thanks (mom and I).

My adult life has been socially challenging. I’ve made some good friends (they live abroad), but I know it has directly impacted my adult life.

In 2021, I hit a shallow point and played with a knife, wanting to stab myself but couldn't do it. I promised myself that if I couldn't improve my life by 30, I would end it all. I don't see the point of living if it’s only to continue being rejected everywhere, never succeeding in anything, and being alone.

&lt;p&gt;I remember around 10 or 11, I wanted to end it. A friend at the time saw me and stopped me. Sometimes I think she shouldn&amp;#39;t have intervened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 18, I left the country. After that, my mother would tell me she loved me and all, but she always had to remind me in every call that it was my fault for this, my fault for that. She also mentioned who would take care of her once she is too old (actually she is 66y) I suppose it will be my older brother (M38). My mother always called me by my brother’s name. I know she rarely called my brother by my name, but for me, it was all the time. My brother and I didn’t live together much; he lived with his father, and his life has also been pretty bad, but at least he is stronger than I am. And anyway, our last text was fine and you, fine thanks (mom and I).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My adult life has been socially challenging. I’ve made some good friends (they live abroad), but I know it has directly impacted my adult life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, I hit a shallow point and played with a knife, wanting to stab myself but couldn&amp;#39;t do it. I promised myself that if I couldn&amp;#39;t improve my life by 30, I would end it all. I don&amp;#39;t see the point of living if it’s only to continue being rejected everywhere, never succeeding in anything, and being alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know my life isn&amp;#39;t the worst, but everyone manages it differently&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"if i find it in me to kms tonight, this'll be my suicide note. i just wanted someone to know what i feel. i'm so alone. such an empty feeling.


""I woke up In the morning and I didn't want anything, didn't do anything, couldn't do It anyway, just lay there listening to the blood rush through me and It never made any sense, anything.""

the sound of my breath, the feeling of my pulse, it's nauseating, all of it.

it's gnawing to exist.

i told my sister i was going to kill myself tonight, but she never responded. so i just deleted the messages to save myself the embarrassment.

i really am the scum of life, not even my own family wants to help me.

i'm so pathetic, i can't take living anymore.

i just want to feel okay again.

i want to listen to nirvana all day and sleep like a baby again. but lying down makes my ribs scrape against the insides my skin, piercing, and it's uncomfortable. 

so i haven't slept that much over these past days.

i feel so lightheaded all of the time, i just want it to stop already. 

i want to feel good, i want to go to school next month and be okay again. 

but i feel as if it's too late for me now.

14 years, yet It feels as If I have been alive for all eternity, excruciatingly.

it's harrowing to have to breathe to survive, to keep my blood pumping through my body, through the tips of my fingers.

i can't handle being this person anymore.

to live the life of a human being anymore.

no one, floating aimlessly through life without purpose or reason.

i'll extend my hand, but no one will take it,

to intertwine their fingers with mine, 

to tell me it'll all be okay again.

no one will bother to help me, no one no one no one.

am i really such a burden?

why must i be so hard to love, why was i born in the first place? nothing.

oh, what a shame it is to be me. i'll cry out against my existence, but i'll still be here. 

nothing, excruciating.

""I shall be nothing, the wind, the sky.""

the texture, the taste, the smell, no motivation, no incentive to do anything anymore.

as i am writing this, i feel so lightheaded, and it's unbearable to even breathe. 

such a strange feeling, to exist.

oppressing, harrowing, incomprehensible.

i feel my heart beat from the inside of my throat, and i feel sickened when i press my fingers against it, to feel it pulsate beneath.

i look into the mirror, and all that looks back is a person who has lost everything.

i miss having the luxury to enjoy life.

it's too late though. i feel too far gone. 

i can't find a reason to be much longer; no desire or hope to live, nothing but the blankness of death after.

""There's nothing worth pursuing at the cost of prolonging a life of suffering.""

i'm so scared of the pain though, that i'm starting to second-guess myself.

i hope it'll snap my neck. i don't want to have to die a slow and suffocating death.

that's what i fear the most, the pain that'll follow death.

why is it so hard to just die painlessly and instantly? 

what a pathetic life i have made for myself,

what a pathetic excuse of a human being.

i truly am nothing to this world.

 it's unbearable to think anymore, to feel anything at all anymore. 

excruciating, nothing.

i just want to fade out of existence so i won't have to think about anything anymore. 

Thinking Is exhausting, and I just want to rest already.

Im 13 this year, not going to mention my gender. My life has been absolutely a complete mess.

Nothing as ever went the right way in my life. 

Im so fucking burnt out which leads to my grades being shit. I argue with my mother at least 6/5 times a week, i can never tell her whats going on because that’s just going to start another argument.

Im so miserable. I wish i was those ppl that has a good relationship with their parents, who is good looking, has friends that they can actually call ‘friends’ , who has amazing grades and countless talents. 

Everything has been going wrong in my life. I can’t remember when was the last good thing that happened to me lmao. Ive attempted to delete my existence last year before and it didnt work. And because of that my relationship with my family members are ruined even more, they literally hate me for it now.

   I’m not one to usually ask for help or anything… I‘ve been taking care of myself for awhile &amp; doing very decent. In the past 2 months I lost my car due to a wreck which then led to me losing my good paying job. I was then able to get a local job at a store &amp; save up for a bike, about a month ago I got the news the house I’ve been renting is getting sold &amp; I have 30 days to move &amp; get out. I had to get rid of my dog I’ve had for 4 years to be able to stay in a motel which really hurt my soul. I got no family to depend on &amp; I’ve never had to deal with not having a car, home, as well as a job. I don’t want to give up but everything feels like it’s pointing me towards it….I’m trying to get over this hump of not having any funds as well as dealing with my modern day issues.

&lt;p&gt;I’m not one to usually ask for help or anything… I‘ve been taking care of myself for awhile &amp;amp; doing very decent. In the past 2 months I lost my car due to a wreck which then led to me losing my good paying job. I was then able to get a local job at a store &amp;amp; save up for a bike, about a month ago I got the news the house I’ve been renting is getting sold &amp;amp; I have 30 days to move &amp;amp; get out. I had to get rid of my dog I’ve had for 4 years to be able to stay in a motel which really hurt my soul. I got no family to depend on &amp;amp; I’ve never had to deal with not having a car, home, as well as a job. I don’t want to give up but everything feels like it’s pointing me towards it….I’m trying to get over this hump of not having any funds as well as dealing with my modern day issues. Wish I could have a pick me up to get me back in motion, anything truly helps if you’re able to donate. I’m use to being the one able to help others I never knew I’d be in such a rough position coming from where I was.

I think this is too much for the venting subreddit so I came here. My emotions are everywhere and I’m still crying so I’m sorry if this doesn’t make a lot of sense.


My dad got a new chair, and yknow cool. I put a towel on it because I was wet from playing outside with water and didn’t want the chair to get wet. My dad got so horrifically upset at me over a wet chair. He was screaming at me, and went on and on of oh i got you dinner but no im such a horrible person when I was getting upset and telling him to stop yelling. Even forcing me to get him tea, I said I didn’t want to but I had no choice, he started screaming at me to get him tea. So I did but didn’t put ice so it wasn’t good enough for him and he continued to get mad. I’m already starting to forget a lot, I think my brain is trying to protect me. But basically a lot of blaming, him trying to victimize himself and so much screaming….even getting mad at me for crying and telling me to stop crying.

The point of why I came here at all, I don’t want to talk your ear off with my problems. And maybe im overreacting. Ive been suicidal in the past, 1 almost successful attempt almost 7 years ago, maybe closer to 6 I don’t fully remember. My life has been ruined by my father, I deal with PTSD and a dissociative disorder (dont want to name) because of him. And i guess my feelings are so overwhelming right now. It makes me wish I could just die yknow? Just be away from him and his scary anger. Hell just now while writing this he came up to me and got mad at more things…cant catch a fucking break. But I guess just. I love my mama, i dont wanna leave her behind. She’s seen me almost die before and it broke her, I can’t imagine breaking her heart and even imagining it kills me inside. It’s hard it’s just so hard to be alive. It’s hard to not just do something to myself right now. I guess I just need somewhere to get this out, I feel like I have nobody and I’ve heard bad things about that 988 number and I’m scared of cops showing up at my house.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m not even small, just average, like 6” x 4.7”. But if you’re not big, you’re small. And my real problem is girth, which is what matters apparently. No matter who I date, at some point, she will have been fucked by some big dick alpha male type guy. No matter what kind of sex I have, it will never be as enjoyable for me as it is for someone with a big dick. I would do literally anything to have a big dick. Literally anything. I’m completely uninterested in sex. I used to have so much ambition, now I have none. If I can’t compete with dick size, why try to compete in any other way? No matter what I do, the hung guys won. They fucked my girl. They got to feel like more of a man than me. She probably praised them for their size. I would literally kill to have one girl tell me “wow you’re so big” and actually mean it. The fact that any girl I date has given a hung guy that ultimate honor, that ultimate joy and respect that I will NEVER get. If she’s given that to another man, or god forbid, multiple men, then what the FUCK is the point in dating? What kind of respect or admiration can she give me that even comes CLOSE to that? It’s beyond unfair. My life has no meaning, only intense emasculation, pain, and pure rage. There is no point. All my life this has crushed me. I hate women. I hate hung men. If I hear that someone has a big dick, I literally go out of my way to make their life harder. I feel pure joy when I hear that something horrible is happening in their life. Sex is pointless for me because of all of this. Life is entirely pointless. Any romantic love I’ve ever had has involved literally constant rage and agony. This is not hyperbole. Therapy doesn’t help because it doesn’t make my dick bigger. Meds don’t help because they don’t make my dick bigger. Nothing helps. Nothing. Any girl I love is not mine, because she gave some guy the greatest joy and admiration possible. I’m just another lesser man. And no one has any sympathy. No one understands. This has run my life from a very early age. If there is a god, I would do anything just to spit in his face. What kind of god would put pure, ultimate pain and humiliation between someone and love. Every hour of every day, I feel like I’m watching my girlfriend get fucked in front of me. I feel like I’m being completely dominated every second of every day. The thing I love most in the world is constantly being ripped away from me in the most disrespectful way possible. I am constantly feeling the deepest betrayal possible. There is no love left in me. No accomplishment in my life has ever come near to even a tenth of this fucking agony. I have absolutely lost all meaning in life. There is no point. I pray every night that I will die in my sleep. If nuclear war broke out, I would cry happy tears and kiss the ground. There is no deeper humiliation and disrespect. I have no dignity left. I stay alive only because of fear of hell. This pain is greater than my love for my parents even, so they’re not even the thing stopping me anymore. Nothing compares. Nothing redeems life to me. It hasn’t gotten any easier over the years. My life’s purpose now is to make others’ lives worse. No one understands? No one wants to make any efforts to ultimately fix this? Fine. The rest of my hellhole torture life is dedicated to making people suffer for taking my love, joy, innocence, and dignity away so fucking disrespectfully.

Before the “size doesn’t matter” comments start showing up, it fucking matters and it fucking matters to me. Don’t fucking lie.

I am 20 now, just got out of a 2 year long abusive relationship that has completely wrecked all my self confidence. I tried dating, and I keep getting ghosted. I went on 2 dates with a guy who I really liked, but he ghosted me after the second date. 

The only purpose I feel I have is to love other people, but I can't even do that right. I work retail and have no life ambitions other than to be happy with a family and a partner I love. I've wanted to do many things but things are constantly going wrong and I keep failing. 

I have alot of health issues, including chronic pain, so I can't do things. I'm always exhausted, I can never sleep, even with sleep medicine. 

I just feel as if I am a worthless person. All I do is hurt the people around me. I have been doing it my whole life. I was the problem child, I had to go to atleast 10 different schools because I kept getting kicked out. I was hospitalized 5 times between the ages 12 to 16 for attempting suicide and self harm.

I’m 15(NB but AFAB) and I hate everything about myself and my life and living in general

Like with how everything is going in the world and everything it’s not like we’ll live to better the world with the way things are going so it’ll be worth it just ending it all now and it’s not like anyone would really miss me cause my younger sistsers stay with their (abusive) dad and my older brother and sister (irish twins) are in their 30s so I don’t see them as is; my father and mother are both right and my middle sister says to come to her if I feel this way but she’s right too so she wouldn’t get it (and she’ll just tell and probably send me away like they all would)

Idk I think I’ve decided since I’ve been contemplating ending it but I think if Trump becomes pres I’ll actually do it

He doesn’t want people like me alive anyways and our rights will just be abolished cause he doesn’t care and I know this’ll probably be taken down cause politics or whatever but it just feels better to write this down somewhere even though no one cares

I haven’t figured out how to do it yet but I’ve heard you can use ibuprofen and I have my own thing of NyQuil and alcohol I have access to so I hope it will get me to sleep and just let me. Stay asleep so I don’t really feel it yknow

I also have my ocd meds but I can’t take pills so I don’t think the liquid would be as effective

I feel bad for thinking and preparing to do this but it will help in the long run since they don’t have a lot of money so they won’t have to pay for me anymore and my younger sisters will get my room and I have 3,000 in the bank they’ve been saving since I was born so they could use that for bills and stuff so really my death would benefit all of them since they say the economy sucks rn

Idk what put me over the edge we were all abused by my stepdad and my stepmother wishes my father would’ve hit me as a kid so I could not be “far left” and everyone just overall hates me and everything hurts all the time and I feel bad all the time but I can’t handle this anymore

At least no one thinks I’m doing bad (my sister even said I’m like todoroki from this one anime cause she’s never heard me ever vent or talk about my emotions lol)

And idk about the president thing I just feel it’s kinda symbolic in a way. All of my family voting for me to die. And they don’t even know it (though I’m not sure if they did they would choose something else anyways)

i havent been diagnosed with ptsd because i dont have any of the symptoms. my mom has severe ptsd, with flashbacks so realistic shes told me about times she had flashbacks so severe she thought my dad successfully killed us all and she was going to end her life because she thought theres nothing to live for if her kids were gone. shes on disability and government housing because of this, she has severe anxiety she barely leaves the house

but i dont understand how i dont have any of these problems and dont 'feel' traumatized. i have friends who say it's normal to not feel traumatized but those people still have symptoms of ptsd, they still get flashbacks or nightmares or triggers. i don't have any of that. i'm just depressed. but i feel like something more has to be really wrong with me because i don't act like anyone else my age. sometimes i suspect i have some kind of intellectual or developmental disability because i struggle with so many basic things. adhd runs in my family and im the only one to not get diagnosed yet so im sure i have that too its just hard when i dont have a diagnosis. i know it has to be more than depression because i dont even feel like a normal functioning person. ive had 2 jobs in the past but i ended up being bullied because i act so childish and i cant even follow simple directions. my last job i ended up in the psych ward from the stress. i was only working part time but i was so sleep deprived and i became addicted to dxm to try to make myself better at socializing. so i ended up in the psych ward and my manager immediately terminated me without even telling me. after that i haven't even tried because i don't want to get bullied again. no matter how many times i get told something i cant learn. i always work slower than other people. part of me doesnt want a job because of laziness but also i feel like it would be more inconvenient for all the other employees for me to be working there. i know i cant expect everyone to be nicve to me and im an adult now so i have to deal with stuff like thsi but i physically cant. if someone yells at me or i get singled out or excluded i cant even breathe i just feel so embarrassed and worthless.

ive tried to look into work from home jobs but a lot of those require some kind of talent or skill or qualification and i have none of thsoe im just completely useless. i wouldnt even mind a work from home call center job or soemthing but i dont know how to even find that. now im just a neet that spends my days rotting in bed . i dont know what to do anymore. people tell me these are the best years of my life im so young i should have so much energy to work and get hobbies and make friends and have fun and im not. im wasting the best years of my life being worthless",t2_gss7fejce,False,,0,False,if i dont get approved for disability and ssi i think im gonna do it,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e2momz,False,dark,0.67,,public,1,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,1720910125.0,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1720909799.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;idk. i&amp;#39;m 19M. i know that&amp;#39;s a bit young to think my life is over already but i&amp;#39;m already completely burnt out. so far my only diagnosis is severe depression, which i&amp;#39;m on zoloft for and i&amp;#39;ve been to therapy (not anymore tho as it hasnt really been effective). i have severe trauma (abusive father physically abused me, held me hostage, tried to kill me and my whole family multiple times, tried to kill my mom in front of me. he went to prison for that, only for 2 yrs on a plea deal tho soo gotta love the american justice system. hes out now but not living with my family. hes still in my life and hes not anything like before so idk), i was also brutally bullied in school. the teachers and counselors never believed me so it continued until i graduated. i had an in school therapist assigned to me when i was 11 because of the severe bullying i was already suicidal, but my mom told me i cant go around telling people that or i&amp;#39;ll end up in the hospital and put in foster care so i was just quiet about my struggles and the therapy did nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i havent been diagnosed with ptsd because i dont have any of the symptoms. my mom has severe ptsd, with flashbacks so realistic shes told me about times she had flashbacks so severe she thought my dad successfully killed us all and she was going to end her life because she thought theres nothing to live for if her kids were gone. shes on disability and government housing because of this, she has severe anxiety she barely leaves the house&lt;/p&gt;

(M 22) I regret receiving oral from other men

At the time I convinced myself a mouth is a mouth. I even kissed 2 of them. I didn’t make out, it was more of a peck. I’m so disgusted with myself. I even cheated on my girlfriend by getting oral from a man. 

I used to watch gay hentai and even jerked off with dudes on Omegle. I jerked off with a transgender on FaceTime. I even asked an Uber driver if he was gay to see if he wanted to do things. When I was little I tried to make a special ed kid touch my dick on the bus. A year ago I was talking to a girl online, asked if she wanted dick and she blocked me. I’m so fucking stupid.

I also had messiah psychosis and walked around my neighborhood naked thinking I was Jesus. I punched my dad in the face during the breakdown.

I hate myself for doing this. Idk how I can live with myself. Every day is a struggle for me. I don’t want to be known as gay. I hate myself so much for this. I deserve to die.

No amount of therapy, medication, talking to friends and family, hospitalization has helped. It’ll feel okay in the moment talking with someone but once I’m alone again all the thoughts return. The thoughts that I’m over trying to get help, its been years on years on years of trying. The thought of I simply do not care about myself or living anymore.

I’ve been telling people i’m “doing better” because i’m getting closer to going through with killing myself. And in a way I do feel better. Knowing I won’t have to deal with another horrible day.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello. I'm going to post this on a few different subs for advice and hope that no one I know sees it. I am 14 years old, my brother is 12. I first ever noticed something was up when I accidentally saw a bunch of cuts on his thigh when his shorts rolled up a little bit. he immediately covered them and we stared at each other for a minute and we didnt say anything. My head stopped and my heart was pounding and I just went back to what I was doing and for the rest of the day I tried to convince myself it wasn't real. I knew it was, but I didn't want it to be. The fear was confirmed when I made a throwaway TikTok account so I could be sneaky and try and see what he was posting on his account without him knowing. He didn't have any posts so I checked his reposts expecting to see maybe one or two sad things but nothing terrible. Every repost was about him wanting to end it or about him thinking he was ugly/fat and wanting to starve himself. I got the same feeling I got when I saw the cuts and I knew I couldn't ignore it. that was a month ago. I didn't do anything then for a few reasons. I was also currently going through a rough patch of my own. It was pretty bad, though I won't go into details on the off chance someone from my family finds this. I was frustrated that I had to take care of and worry about not only myself but him too. I was also frustrated that this had to be my problem all over again, just when I was starting to get better. I'm 14. I didn't want to deal with it, I wanted an adult to do what they're supposed to do. The other reason was that I thought he was starting counseling soon, and I figured he would tell the therapist everything and it wouldn't be my burden. 

  
But fast-forward to present day. I couldn't sleep last night because my brain reminded me of the situation. I thought that maybe it was over and he was feeling better, so I checked his account again. All of his reposts and liked videos were still public, and they are just worse now. He's liking and reposting videos about wanting to shoot himself and about how no one would care if he killed himself. I felt sick again and I realized I just had to do something. I keep telling myself that I would rather go through the discomfort of this right now than the sadness of his death later. 

  
My problem is that it is extremely hard for me to be open about these things. I've been to therapy 3 times and have gotten nowhere because I couldn't for the life of me tell them what was wrong. Even when I was younger I would hide myself under the sheets while confessing something I felt bad about and I would write letters to slip under my dads door when I had to tell him something even a bit vulnerable. It's incredibly difficult and I don't trust myself to be able to do it. So I came up with a plan. I know it sounds elaborate and so unnecessary if I could just tell someone but I cant. It's either this or I keep trying to trick my brain into not believing what I've seen.

  
I'll borrow an envelope from a friend of mine down the road so my family won't know it came from the house. I'll print out screenshots of what he has reposted and a screenshot of his TikTok account in black and white as my printer is always faulty with the same colors and I don't want them to put 2 and 2 together. I'll also print out a few maps of the new school I'm going to just incase someone hears me printing, and I'll say that I just wanted to be extra prepared because it's a big school. I'll print out a typed-out letter claiming that I am a friend of one of his friends and found his TikTok account. I'll say I want to remain anon because it would really be preferred for me and that there are clearly more important things than the sender of this letter. I'll explain what it means that he has reposted the videos and I'll say that since his reposted videos and liked videos were public it seemed like a cry for help. I'll end it by saying something like ' I'm sure you're aware of the kid who ended his life at our school. I don't want the same thing to happen again. please take this all into consideration.' which is all true. Then I'll cut the photos and the letter into smaller pieces of paper so they don't realize its the same paper in our printer at home. I'm trying to think of red herrings I can add that will hopefully deter them from thinking it's me that sent it. I'll just write a string of random letters and numbers in the corner or something. I dunno. I'm still trying to think of what to do for the return address, the stamp, and the name and address as there can't be a return address and my fathers' name and address will have to be written, so I don't want them to connect the handwriting to me. Maybe I'll write it with my left hand. Then on Monday I'll sneak out and try to slip it into the mailbox without anyone noticing I was gone. Finally, I will claim to feel sick and not want to eat dinner the night I expect him to open it so I don't have to witness it. If he doesn't open it that night, than I'll try to go to a friend's house until late. Or I'll just say I'm going to their house and I'll just walk wherever. 

  
I know this seems excessive and over the top. Believe me, I know. I just don't want to be more involved than I have to be. I want to stop talking about suicide as quickly as possible. I want my brother to get the help he needs and I want everything to be alright. I don't want him to be mad at me for snitching or whatever.

I&amp;#39;ll print out screenshots of what he has reposted and a screenshot of his TikTok account in black and white as my printer is always faulty with the same colors and I don&amp;#39;t want them to put 2 and 2 together. I&amp;#39;ll also print out a few maps of the new school I&amp;#39;m going to just incase someone hears me printing, and I&amp;#39;ll say that I just wanted to be extra prepared because it&amp;#39;s a big school. I&amp;#39;ll print out a typed-out letter claiming that I am a friend of one of his friends and found his TikTok account. I&amp;#39;ll say I want to remain anon because it would really be preferred for me and that there are clearly more important things than the sender of this letter. I&amp;#39;ll explain what it means that he has reposted the videos and I&amp;#39;ll say that since his reposted videos and liked videos were public it seemed like a cry for help. I&amp;#39;ll end it by saying something like &amp;#39; I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;re aware of the kid who ended his life at our school. I don&amp;#39;t want the same thing to happen again. please take this all into consideration.&amp;#39; which is all true. Then I&amp;#39;ll cut the photos and the letter into smaller pieces of paper so they don&amp;#39;t realize its the same paper in our printer at home. I&amp;#39;m trying to think of red herrings I can add that will hopefully deter them from thinking it&amp;#39;s me that sent it. I&amp;#39;ll just write a string of random letters and numbers in the corner or something. I dunno. I&amp;#39;m still trying to think of what to do for the return address, the stamp, and the name and address as there can&amp;#39;t be a return address and my fathers&amp;#39; name and address will have to be written, so I don&amp;#39;t want them to connect the handwriting to me. Maybe I&amp;#39;ll write it with my left hand. Then on Monday I&amp;#39;ll sneak out and try to slip it into the mailbox without anyone noticing I was gone. Finally, I will claim to feel sick and not want to eat dinner the night I expect him to open it so I don&amp;#39;t have to witness it. If he doesn&amp;#39;t open it that night, than I&amp;#39;ll try to go to a friend&amp;#39;s house until late. Or I&amp;#39;ll just say I&amp;#39;m going to their house and I&amp;#39;ll just walk wherever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this seems excessive and over the top. Believe me, I know. I just don&amp;#39;t want to be more involved than I have to be. I want to stop talking about suicide as quickly as possible. I want my brother to get the help he needs and I want everything to be alright. I don&amp;#39;t want him to be mad at me for snitching or whatever. Any comments or ideas or nice words or anything really would be appreciated. I can&amp;#39;t sleep in dread for the day I have to put the plan in action, which will be Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

To the eyes of someone not close to me, I appear to be content with life and being able to help people in any way i can. Now, I just don't know anymore.

There are certainly a number of factors in why I have been depressed. But i want to discuss right now is what would eventually turn into losing of my closest friends. I have a feeling that in due time i will be losing all of my best friends, and it will be because of all of my wrongdoings. On our friend group, I was unknowingly making offensive jokes, thinking that it was that on that stage of being friends where we could tell some jokes and would just laugh it off. Without me knowing until recently, I have actually been offending one of my female friends that we would call ""Jewel"" for the time being
















It all started about 10 months ago, i was just starting a sense of depression feels like. Ever since grade school, I haven't made the one that i can truly call a friend since I have been switching schools every 3 years. When I went to my 11th grade, I only have 1 goal: to have tons of friends whom i could bond with even if we go separate ways to our dream colleges and future careers (ik my goal is a bit cliche but stay with me on this one). On the 1st month, I have met my future best friend, that for the sake of anonymity, we will call him ""Alan."" Alan was like the brother I never had. We had a lot of a common interest, and would be even be not exaggerating to call it too much. From the shows we watch, the games we play, hell even our music taste are the same! I couldn't have asked for a better friend like him.

Back to the topic at hand, at the height of my depression, Alan was the first one I have reached out to talk about it. I was really anxious and scared on what to tell him because this would be my first time opening up to someone. In the end, Alan comforted me on one of my toughest times and said to me that he'll be always avaliable.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello everyone, I am going to talk about stomach issues that been affecting me. For about a year I’ve started getting very bad pains in the lower left region of my left side. I had a colonoscopy because of this because the pain also made noises and made it harder to poop. This affected me at work and anyways my gastroenterologist specialist recommended that I get a Endoscopy as well. Long story short is I got both. They found internal hemorrhoids which are in my rectum. They also found a hiatal hernia above. Before my endoscopy I never felt anything in this region and now I have constant acid, the sensation of burping, and I also have difficulty sleeping. There is pain above as well and a lot of stomach noise at times and it’s difficult to sleep. Long story short is I called the medical place and the receptionist just told me she got my labs. She stated the doctors would return my call but they never did and I waited 4 weeks to make sure. They didn’t offer no medication or nothing and the receptionist said it’s a “small hernia so it’s fine”. Now I have two pains that are pretty much everlasting, they make so much noise, and I don’t want to do anything. I have distanced myself from everyone, will not go out, and I only work to live. School has gotten more tough so I lowered my college classes because I can’t work as effectively anymore without the constant need for breaks as this pain affects me mentally too. I’ve fallen behind on life, quit my stable job, and I can’t escape this. I think I would rather die than continue and nobody will help me.

,SuicideWatch,"I have not wished to be dead in a long time. But now I do again. Someones parent is guilt tripping me to forgive their child of something they did. I accidentally discovered i chose the wrong person again.

I became hypertensive when i got pregnant. My blood pressure shot up today and i felt like my nape was going numb. I called &amp; messaged my husband but he chose to clean the floors of our work site instead of going home and check on me. We are both architects and i am incharge of taking care of the baby today but i still work at home when i am not on-site.

I just felt like he chose to clean the floors over checking if i am still alive. I now dont know who to call when my blood pressure shoots up again. Guess i'll just die in the bedroom while our baby plays til her daddy comes home.

Right before we moved, we found out I could possibly have a gene making me susceptible to certain cancers (brca). He said if I have it, he doesn’t want to have bio children with me, and will end our relationship. I have been with him for 6 yrs. 

Six. Fucking. Years.

I couldnt even comprehend. The stress of living in  a new place where i know literally no one, living with his alcoholic father, working at a soul sucking job, working opposite hours from each other, knowing I could have a cancer gene, and knowing my relationship i worked my whole life for could end? Who in their right mind wouldnt want to end it all?

He was my first everything. First date, first kiss, took my virginity. He taught me how to love, and now he wants to take it all back on the off chance our kids could inherit a gene that would leave them more susceptible to cancer? Are you fucking joking?

The entire world is crumbling around me. I truly feel like everything I have is in danger of being ripped from my hands. My health, my home, my love, my family, everything.

I dont even want to find out if i have this gene. I’ve been blowing my money on stupid shit and lying about my paychecks to put off saving for it. I dont want to get this fucking test done and have my entire world explode if I have it. And what happens if I find out I dont? I just make peace with the fact he was going to throw me away because I’d produce defective  spawn? 

Everything I ever believed Id be with him has exploded in my face. I had no backup moving here with him. I had no plan b. He was my only hope of getting out of the abusive home I was in. We had a life, we were best friends, I truly thought we were soulmates. And now? Everything is blowing up in my face.

If I have it, If he leaves me, he’s going to give me a large sum of money. I’m going to visit Japan, I’m going to do some crazy things, and then just leave this world.

We have baby names picked out, we would look at baby clothes together, and now? Now it’s all just some big fucked up joke.

,SuicideWatch,"I hesitated in high school on picking a university major. I darted back and forth between the various possibilities until I foolishly settled for getting a trade, despite being physically unskilled; I rarely feel as though I'm inside of my own body, but some sort of perverse outside spectator watching myself get screwed by life. Looking back, I should've made a plan and stuck to it, now I'm unemployed and stuck under the delusion that I'm taking this time to improve myself. I live with my parents, and currently have no hope of moving out without a job. Despite all my hopes to improve, I'm constantly let down by my own lethargy; Everyday is a constant drag and I'm just glad for it to end. I crave the night, to fall asleep and deepen my rut tomorrow.

I suck at everything, but I shouldn't bounce around between possibilities so much. I should just stick to one thing and be miserable, I hate myself for the struggle it takes to stay present.

,SuicideWatch,"I hate caring for other peoples feelings more than my own. The thoughts of killing myself paused for about a year &amp; I think I was actually happy ? then my relationship fell apart, crashed my car, went into debt, lost people who were supposed to be friends, fell in love again (twice, what a dumbass) &amp; now I’ve lost my job only to find out I’m so much deeper in debt than I really realized. I could talk about it &amp; I know my friends would listen but it feels so cliche. To say it out loud &amp; mean it &amp; vent about it.  
I wish I could just kill myself but I can’t. It would be nice to die &amp; my problems would disappear for me, but they would also become someone else’s problems. I’m enough of an issue alive I don’t want to do that to my family. I don’t know what comes after we die but if it’s the whole “watching over your loved ones” thing I don’t wanna watch them all be sad &amp; struggling to grieve while realizing how deep of a hole I dug for myself in my short time here. 
I fuck things up for myself a lot. I notice them starting to crash &amp; burn &amp; I suddenly have no motivation to fix it. no drive to get back on track. That’s where I’m at now. 
Everything has crashed &amp; burned &amp; I just want to rot in bed instead of figuring out how to fix it. I want to run away &amp; hide but it doesn’t fix anything. 
I’ve thought about driving away &amp; killing myself at a rest stop hours &amp; hours away so there’s no chance anyone I care about has to be the one to find me. Or even just locked in my room with a note that says “don’t look, just call the police. I love you” 
I don’t wanna be the sad backstory my neices &amp; nephews tell when they overshare at a party in 5 or 10 years. I don’t wanna be the traumatic event that changes my family dynamic. I don’t want my older sister to be an only child at 33. 
But fuck, I hate it here. I have for years &amp; it’s amazing that for a short time I was really happy. I really genuinely didn’t want to kill myself at some point &amp; then it came back when I realized that every shitty thing that happened was my fault.

I wish I could guarantee that if I disappeared from the face of the earth, it wouldn’t affect anything or anyone at all. I could disappear peacefully, no one would remember, no one would notice &amp; no one would have to clean up the mess I leave behind.

The thoughts of killing myself paused for about a year &amp;amp; I think I was actually happy ? then my relationship fell apart, crashed my car, went into debt, lost people who were supposed to be friends, fell in love again (twice, what a dumbass) &amp;amp; now I’ve lost my job only to find out I’m so much deeper in debt than I really realized. I could talk about it &amp;amp; I know my friends would listen but it feels so cliche. To say it out loud &amp;amp; mean it &amp;amp; vent about it.&lt;br/&gt;
I wish I could just kill myself but I can’t. It would be nice to die &amp;amp; my problems would disappear for me, but they would also become someone else’s problems. I’m enough of an issue alive I don’t want to do that to my family. I don’t know what comes after we die but if it’s the whole “watching over your loved ones” thing I don’t wanna watch them all be sad &amp;amp; struggling to grieve while realizing how deep of a hole I dug for myself in my short time here. 
I fuck things up for myself a lot. I notice them starting to crash &amp;amp; burn &amp;amp; I suddenly have no motivation to fix it. no drive to get back on track. That’s where I’m at now. 
Everything has crashed &amp;amp; burned &amp;amp; I just want to rot in bed instead of figuring out how to fix it. I want to run away &amp;amp; hide but it doesn’t fix anything. 
I’ve thought about driving away &amp;amp; killing myself at a rest stop hours &amp;amp; hours away so there’s no chance anyone I care about has to be the one to find me. Or even just locked in my room with a note that says “don’t look, just call the police. I love you” 
I don’t wanna be the sad backstory my neices &amp;amp; nephews tell when they overshare at a party in 5 or 10 years. I don’t wanna be the traumatic event that changes my family dynamic. I don’t want my older sister to be an only child at 33. 
But fuck, I hate it here. I have for years &amp;amp; it’s amazing that for a short time I was really happy. I really genuinely didn’t want to kill myself at some point &amp;amp; then it came back when I realized that every shitty thing that happened was my fault.

So let me start off by a little back ground I’m 19m I meant the love of my life when I was 16 and she was 17. I dropped out of school to support her and moved in with her because my family situation wasn’t the best. We were inseperateable we were together every single day. We even got jobs together. Well eventually I got a good job making good money at 17. By 18 we moved out of her mom’s house and into an apartment where we spent exactly one year fighting for everything we had. Well back in November I got laid off from that really good job and couldn’t find work anywhere I was desperate to provide for her I did everything I could I applied to 100+ places but in the end we ended up losing the apartment in February. Well it was my bright idea to move in with someone who was abusive to me in my child hood. It went well at first me and my finance at the time really enjoyed it we even got a puppy. Well up comes May and it’s our anniversary. I get black out drunk. “Pregaming” and we ended up fighting over something that she was completely right about. It spiraled out of control and I smacked her leg while talking. She felt really unsafe and was gone the next day over 800 miles away. Ever since that day I have been lost. I don’t know what todo anymore this isn’t the only thing I’m living with either I geniunely can’t take it. Everything that happened was my fault but in my mind the whole time I was just trying to provide for her and build a future blind to the fact that I was abusing her. I have tried every form of help that’s available and nothing has worked for me. I feel as if I will inflict less pain if I am no longer a factor. I’m not sure how or when or anything like that yet but every second of everyday it’s all I think about. It’s the last thing I think about when I wake up and last thing when I pass out. If I pass out. I still managed to get up and goto work minus missing a few days from being in the hospital. I just got fired not even sure why. Right after I spent everything I had and put my self in debt to get my first vehicle which isn’t even a real vehicle it’s a moped.

But that’s probally not going to be possible. I don’t want to hurt anyone else with my actions. So “moped” crash or anything like that is out of the question there would be a lot of people that would have to deal with me then. And yes it maybe there jobs but who am I to make there awful job even worse for my own selfish gain. And yes I do realize it is extreamly selfish but I just can’t go on like this anymore. I feel like if anyone were put in my shoes they would do the same thing.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 17, from Turkey and I just dont know what will make me happy. I have a roof atop my head, a cozy bed and food and water. If I say I was sad it would be shameful wouldnt it? Millions of people over the world are much poorer than I am, they are in the middle of wars they don't even have anything to do with, many people have bad parents, live in horrible places, have no friends, are oppressed, yet they still try holding on to life, they still work hard to live and stay alive. They try brushing off their problems and continue their lives.

And we have me, complaining about some nothing. Do I even have the right to complain? I should be disgusted at myself for even thinking of a possibilty of su1cide. How can I do that while there are millions who are in worse conditions than me right? And my parents, they have fed me and took care of me for my whole life and going away without returning anything would be disrespectful to them right? Or is it already their fault for bringing me to this world. Maybe I shouldnt feel indebted to them because they wanted to make another child because of their selfishness and them wanting another kid and nobody asked me my opinion about being born. So they are supposed to take care of me and feed me, because they themselves wanted to make a child so its their duty to do so right? I honestly don't know which one I should feel. I guess my brother wasnt enough for them though, I know that at least.

I have lots of friends, they are all good people, but not even a SINGLE one of them will accept me for who I really am. I don't even know what I am by the way. I am certain of a few things though. I was born into a male body. I know that I like my hair long, and I like having bangs, I like learning about makeup, I like feminine clothing, I know that I hate my masculine body, I hate my body hair, I hate my thick eyebrows that most of my guy friends envy, I hate that I'm as tall as I am, and I know that I feel that something just isn't right. Am I trans? I don't know, maybe I am. But who cares about the labels, I just know that I want to live the way I want to. My friends though? They aren't willing to accept me. No way am I EVER going to open up. Most of my friends are Muslims, even those that aren't, they hate everything related to lgbtq+. I was an hypocrite when one of my closest friends was proudly talking to me about burning a rainbow flag in the street. and I laughed at it. I have no place in the lgbtq+ community because I am not proud about who I am. I can't proudly defend my real thoughts, and I'm supposed to live up to my father and friends' expectations of being some big muscular dominant male or something. It's been 13 months since I started going to the gym. I'm stronger than most of those friends. They respect me. But what if they knew that deep down I wanted to keep my hair down, and learn more about makeup? Why do they care even? It's my body isn't it.

Hormone therapy? Maybe hitting up a psychologist? Or a therapist? I don't know how to. I don't know about any of these things. I know that I am not opening up to my parents about any of this. Forget gender, but I am not even saying a single word about having symptoms of clinical depression. I was the hypocrite who laughed and agreed with my father when he proclaimed that depression is some nonsense created by the west to disrupt our progression. I thought my brother was more sane. He says that Turkey is a country bound by its customs and religion. He says that he supports lgbtq+, religious freedom, he says he wants to change how the country is. Yesterday, I decided that I wanted to cut my hair. I got tired of hating myself and suddenly losing all joy whenever I looked at my reflection, in the phone, in the mirror, wherever and whatever. I watched some videos, grabbed a scissor, and cut some tall bangs to cover my large forehead and my receding hairline (at this age, I know). I got out of the bathroom, my brother saw me, he started laughing. ""What, u transitioning or something?"" ""You look like a girl, its awful."". Yeah, they are all supportive of modernising or whatever unless it comes to someone they know. My mother is probably like that also. I am not gonna open up to anyone I know, like, ever.

One of my friends saw my hair. He said that he hated it. He said that he would pay for my haircut and he said that he was gonna arrange a barber next week. What about my opinion? You haven't asked me? He said that I hadn't had a relationship ever, and with hair like that, I wouldn't ever get one either. Who cares? I don't cut my hair, I don't look after myself, I don't go to the gym and build a body just to get in some fake relationship that's all about looks. And this guy had long hair for years mind you. Now that a few months ago he was clean shaven, he somehow turned into a guy who hates long hair? ""Friends"" right. I like his company nevertheless. Some other friend saw me. He would oftenly joke about how I would look great in feminine clothing, and that I should ""open an onlyfans"". Hilarious jokes I know, I never found them funny. He hated the hair the most. He angrily said that I should hide that horrible hair. I thought you were with me though? You joked about feminine clothing because of my long hair but if I was to actually wear a skirt, I believe you would get me out of your life and hate me. I sent a friend whom I opened up about these feelings I had a photo. He said I was mentally ill. He assumed that I was ""turned to normal"" after I started hitting the gym. Well, the one dude who I thought would help me throughout this was also turned against me now. Really good being alone. Sure I got friends, but in reality I don't have ANYONE whom I can talk about my real feelings. Oh yea, I also had that one dude. He ""was"" pansexual. He used to help me, but he said that he turned into a Muslim and he was only a pansexual because he was a kid. He was ""normal"" now, he said. He used to preach us about loving everyone because he watched vinland saga (an anime about basically having no enemies). One time we were talking, he said that he was homophobic. I asked, you used to say that you hated no people, and what about gay people then? They can't control who they love or not? He said that he didn't consider them as ""people"" to begin with. So yeah, I am, in fact, alone in reality.

Maybe I should just buzzcut my hair. My hair is the only thing that binds me to my true self I feel like. If I cut my hair, would I forget about the gender dysmorphia and become a true man? Or will the dysmorphia kill me and I would be even more depressed and would hate myself even more? My friends would like me more that's for sure. But it's not worth it. Maybe it is, I don't know. I don't have the balls to take such a leap anyway.

Next year, I'm going to have an exam. That single exam basically singlehandedly decides which college we will be going to in Turkey. All our lives, bound by 1 single exam. I want to be an artist. I aim for graphic design in a good college here. I won't be able to do it though. The stress started hitting me already. I have only a year, so many people are ahead of me. People who go to courses, have lessons about art. I am here with only my self-made talent. I am supposed to work without sleep on art for an exam a year later. I hate it. I really enjoy drawing, but the whole year will be a nightmare. An older friend of mine. He committed su1cide because of this exam. The pressure was too much for him. (There's no su1cide hotline in Turkey btw, as a side note) My brother took the exam a few years ago. His routine was waking up 6 am, 2 hours of studying, 8 am to 4 pm was school, 4 pm to 8 pm was cram school. 8 pm to 10 pm was studying and he slept after. This was his routine for a WHOLE YEAR. He got into the college he wanted, he also finished grade as the top of the school. I know that I don't have this in me. I can't study this much, even if it's drawing. My father just barely agreed with me after weeks of arguments that he would allow me to go to art school. If I can't get in this year, its over.

I tried self harming today. I grabbed some knife, cut through my thigh. It hurt, there was blood. I felt nothing after it. I don't know what I was expecting. Maybe I just gaslit myself into depression? Whatever, I am not doing that again. I don't know what I'm expecting posting this here. If there is a karma limit its all for nothing anyway. If there isn't , I would most likely get a few responses anyway. I know I wouldn't read through this block of text. Venting feels good sometimes though. I don't know. I don't know what I should do. I have much more to write, but who cares anyway. I don't even care enough to write them down myself. Whatever, even if I don't get replies, it felt good to write this anyway.

,SuicideWatch,"Love my therapist, but don't even know where to begin. I started seeing her earlier this year. She reckons I'm getting better. I personally think I'm getting much worse (and I've been transparent about this). 

Anyways, I told her recently that I feel pretty suicidal. She asks why. I mention that being mentally ill and neurodivergent in a society not made for me makes me wish I was dead. I tell her I've been suicidal for 14 years, with little to no relief. I also mentioned the housing crisis, the planet dying, the crashing economy, the fact that I probably won't be able to retire, and the cold, cruel reality of having to wake up everyday to earn money to provide for a body I hate/keep a roof over my head is my own personal nightmare. I have no aspirations. I hate my life. And I never asked to be born. 

She looked right at me and said, ""have you tried taking care of a plant?""

I started seeing her earlier this year. She reckons I&amp;#39;m getting better. I personally think I&amp;#39;m getting much worse (and I&amp;#39;ve been transparent about this). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways, I told her recently that I feel pretty suicidal. She asks why. I mention that being mentally ill and neurodivergent in a society not made for me makes me wish I was dead. I tell her I&amp;#39;ve been suicidal for 14 years, with little to no relief. I also mentioned the housing crisis, the planet dying, the crashing economy, the fact that I probably won&amp;#39;t be able to retire, and the cold, cruel reality of having to wake up everyday to earn money to provide for a body I hate/keep a roof over my head is my own personal nightmare. I have no aspirations. I hate my life. And I never asked to be born. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She looked right at me and said, &amp;quot;have you tried taking care of a plant?&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At first, I thought I&amp;#39;d misheard her. But, no. She told me that taking care of a plant would make me feel better. &lt;/p&gt;

some extra context is that we've been together for almost 3 years but we nearly broke up last week largely due to changes in my behaviour and hurtful things i've done (mostly due to my worsening depression and insecurities) as well as me feeling like she's no longer attracted to me or no longer wanting to be with me in general. i've also officially lost another important friendship of mine within that same week (unrelated, just piling on top of each other). getting out of bed is hard, going to sleep is hard (things i've never had issues with) and i don't see anything that can fix this in the future. i don't talk to anyone except for my partner about my mental health. i don't have friends i can turn to and my family would freak out and make it worse i think. if anyone's experienced this kind of decline please let me know what you did to get through it. i'm fully convinced that i'm a failure and doomed to tragedy for multiple different reasons in every area of my life i can picture and that everyone would be objectively better off without me here. i feel so alone and invisible. i can't help but ruin everything good that comes my way and it feels like nothing will ever change because fundamentally i am the problem, something went really wrong with me at some point and now some mistake in my code makes it so that good things are impossible. every moment when i'm not completely breaking down feels like an ignorant filler moment before i experience pain that has been unimaginable until this point and i'm sick of life torturing me like this, letting me regain false hope when it's just in me to destroy everything. i don't want to cause further pain to anyone and i have pretty debilitating health/death anxiety but my general mental state has gotten so bad i've been watching movie scenes of characters committing suicide to try and exhaust myself into not thinking about it anymore or living it out vicariously which would be unthinkable if i were at my baseline. i selfishly just want to make it through but even all the things i've been excited to experience (some concerts, receiving a cool order i made) don't make me feel anything but shame because i know i don't deserve these experiences. i know i'm probably screaming into the void but it feels like my last resort (there are no suicide hotlines in my country haha), if anyone's experienced this please just tell me your story or share anything that helped you or just anything at all.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm kind of done.

I want a family. I want to have kids and live a good life.

But as it stands, I didn't luck out on the gene pool it seems.

Two decades ago I got accused of being a stalker. I took it very personally and hid myself from the world. I didn't understand how or why or what my behavior was at the time so I just counted myself out

I've had some successful relationships since then but  occasionally I find myself in a situation related to that. It's extremely frustrating because a lot of times when I hear about actual sexual assault and other dudes pulling shit I never put my hands on anyone. There are times that I kissed someone but it was consensual and I never initiated it. But I was blamed for it anyway, as if I should have known better.

As of recent, even the bar that I go to where I would think I am welcome treats me as if I am a predator. The best I can do is keep to myself but most of the women who frequent the bar don't say a word to me. 

As much as I try to rationalize it, it hurts a lot. It makes me feel like there is nothing I can do to change this, I just have to accept the fact that I'm a loser and not worthy of offspring. That I have a major flaw of some sort that makes me unlikable.

The best way it seems to interact in this world is to pretend I'm not interested in sex whatsoever. That I don't make any indication benign or otherwise to get to know any woman, even if it's for friendship. I would love nothing more than to have female friends and the like. 

When I do date I feel on the defensive. That I have to accept the leftovers or otherwise emotionally immature people. They have their own issues which are detrimental to my relationship goals, but I'm not supposed to judge. I have to be accepting even if I don't find them all that attractive.

I'm getting better at saying no and having boundaries, but in doing so I feel just as lonely. I recently broke it off with someone because I couldn't stand her lashing out at me at the slightest provocation. I felt as if I was treating her with kid gloves and I couldn't discuss any serious topics. I wanted desperately for it to work and such but I was accused of being a coward for not talking to her. I said I didn't want to be lashed out anymore. 

I don't know what to do. I'm facing the reality that I will die alone without offspring and no one really cares. I don't feel worthy or attractive and anything I do to fix either doesn't solve it.

,SuicideWatch,"I (26F) have struggled with varying intensities of suicidal ideation my entire life. I go through the same phases of depression that I see people talk about here. I’m in therapy and have been for three years and I can say, without a doubt, that it has never been this bad before.

For the first time in my life I feel like there isn’t a single person I can lean on or speak to about how bad things have gotten. I can sense the boredom in my friends’ standard “my life is better with you in it,” responses when, at the urge of my therapist, I’ve gotten real and vulnerable. I know it’s not their responsibility to convince me to live, but I don’t feel supported. I’ve shied away from talking about it because I don’t want anyone to be bored of me. 

I’m harboring insane amounts of guilt for not calling my mom as often as I should. I forgot to wish my stepfather a happy Father’s Day last month, and now I’m afraid to text him. I think everyone is mad at me. I’m mad at me. My sisters (I have four) lean on me for emotional support because I’m the eldest, and I can’t handle it anymore. It’s like the blind leading the blind. 

If I wasn’t so neurotic about the desire to die in the comfort of my apartment, but not wanting to put anyone on the position of finding me dead in the bathtub or whatever, I would do it tonight. I don’t want my therapist to shoulder the weight of thinking she failed. I don’t want my friends to have their weeks ruined by the news. I have a cat, who will take care of her?

It hit me while I was reading this afternoon that I could do it. It’s like being stuck in quick sand and the more I try to crawl out, the more I’m sucked in.

,SuicideWatch,"I've been having a rough time lately.

Depression is bad. Have been off my meds.


Just a series of bad things one after another. Rejected by women.
Roommates being filthy jackasses.
Car problems.


Today I got rejected for a small studio apartment, I really needed to keep my sanity and focus to try and turn things around.


Then I found out my school classes aren't being paid for because  the Federal Government THINKS they overpaid me in loan money...I don't know how that even works. But they won't give any more aid until I pay the excess back which means I have to pay for classes out of pocket.


Then...to finish off the night. My air cooler (the only thing saving me from being 100% miserable in this heat/humidity wave) leaked water on the floor, and I didn't notice for hours.


During which it soaked 3 boxes of Magic the Gathering cards. Ruining many and damaging more. I lost probably several hundred dollars worth of cards. Now worthless and unplayable.



There is no other explanation.

There is no way I am just THAT unlucky.

No way I just coincidentally have all these bad things happening at once.

No.

There IS a God.

He is a bastard fuck.

He WANTS me to unalive myself.


The kicker?

I have an appointment on Monday with a new Psychatrist to get back on meds.

He is trying to ensure I KMS before that appointment.


I have sweat and cried so much today.
