###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpersonal_theory_of_suicide), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

I can continue my healing from depression and I might overcome it, I can just study more slowly and maybe hire a tutor. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, having experienced heartbreak numerous times before, I have grown familiar with it and can now move on more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you all. This is because of your support and advices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am extremely depressed and can&amp;#39;t find joy in this life anymore. I have suicidal thoughts regularly. I do not want to continue this existence at all. I have absolutely nothing to say or express anymore. It gives me pain knowing this will probably be how I live for the next few years, and I can&amp;#39;t bear the thought of living like this any longer.&lt;/p&gt;

 But no, i'm just a worthless loser. I spent so much time reaching out to people only to get ignored or dismissed with cheap excuses. Year after year. The only woman who ever gave me some positive attention ended up taking advantage of me and abusing me for months. And she was taunting me non stop about how women can get anyone these days and men should just bend over backwards to appease them. 

That's the only thing i'm good for. She was nice as long as i was simping for her. My friends only talk when they need something. Got taken advantage of many times since then. Got told many times how much of a loser i am since then. My mother told me i'm the type of guy women settle down with when they turn 30 and look for someone ""reliable"": has a job, owns a house, ""talks very little but listens a lot"". That's all i'm useful for. 6 years of self improvement changed absolutely nothing about it. Couldn't even have sex like a normal fucking age. At best i'll be just one of those meek loser ""late bloomers"". Another weakness for people to pick up on and exploit me. 

Nobody ever supports me. Everybody i tried talking to is just annoyed. Get therapy, stop whining, focus on some hobbies. My former ""friend"" also told me to fuck hookers if i have to. I've been doing that for two years ever since i started working full time. It didn't make me happy. Not at all. Just more bitter that my family is satisfied they finally made me shut the fuck up and cope. 

I just don't want to live anymore. I've been suicidal for two years and nothing gets better. My youth is gone. My high school experience is gone. My college experience is gone. I'll never catch up because i'm too busy working and i'm still the same loser i always was. Even if i did, i'll have the joy of getting that teenage experience 10 years late as a bitter and broken adult. What's the point in it now? My abusive friend won. My family won. 6 years later i'm exactly the man they wanted me to be. I just don't give a shit. This life is just worthless. Every night before sleep i think of how much i want this to finally end.

Got taken advantage of many times since then. Got told many times how much of a loser i am since then. My mother told me i&amp;#39;m the type of guy women settle down with when they turn 30 and look for someone &amp;quot;reliable&amp;quot;: has a job, owns a house, &amp;quot;talks very little but listens a lot&amp;quot;. That&amp;#39;s all i&amp;#39;m useful for. 6 years of self improvement changed absolutely nothing about it. Couldn&amp;#39;t even have sex like a normal fucking age. At best i&amp;#39;ll be just one of those meek loser &amp;quot;late bloomers&amp;quot;. Another weakness for people to pick up on and exploit me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nobody ever supports me. Everybody i tried talking to is just annoyed. Get therapy, stop whining, focus on some hobbies. My former &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; also told me to fuck hookers if i have to. I&amp;#39;ve been doing that for two years ever since i started working full time. It didn&amp;#39;t make me happy. Not at all. Just more bitter that my family is satisfied they finally made me shut the fuck up and cope. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just don&amp;#39;t want to live anymore. I&amp;#39;ve been suicidal for two years and nothing gets better. My youth is gone. My high school experience is gone. My college experience is gone. I&amp;#39;ll never catch up because i&amp;#39;m too busy working and i&amp;#39;m still the same loser i always was. Even if i did, i&amp;#39;ll have the joy of getting that teenage experience 10 years late as a bitter and broken adult. What&amp;#39;s the point in it now? My abusive friend won. My family won. 6 years later i&amp;#39;m exactly the man they wanted me to be. I just don&amp;#39;t give a shit. This life is just worthless. Every night before sleep i think of how much i want this to finally end. I have two packs of sleeping pills waiting for me to gather the courage and finally end this misery&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hi Everyone, 

I’m just using this as a way to vent my thoughts on what I’ve been feeling. I don’t have family or friends. Just me. 

I’ve been stressed out lately on where I am in life. I don’t have a job, I’ve applied over 800 jobs in finance and I can’t land one. I have 8 years of experience and I can’t seem to get through the final stages. Bills are piling on and I can’t catch a break. 

4 years ago it wasn’t like this, I was with a long term relationship and a house and a great job and was making $300K a year in banking. 

Then 2 years ago, my mom passed away. Lead me down a a very depressed path. I found my comfort in alcohol and gambling to numb the pain. Emptied my bank accounts and just gave it away to random philanthropy places because I wanted to end my life. 

I ignored and pushed away the love of my life, my friends, and I don’t have my only family I had which was my mom. 

I live in an apartment that’s past due by 30 days, and I have no electricity, and I can’t even land a job. 

Depression is a monster and it’s 3am and I don’t know what to do or say or to even think…

&lt;p&gt;I’m just using this as a way to vent my thoughts on what I’ve been feeling. I don’t have family or friends. Just me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been stressed out lately on where I am in life. I don’t have a job, I’ve applied over 800 jobs in finance and I can’t land one. I have 8 years of experience and I can’t seem to get through the final stages. Bills are piling on and I can’t catch a break. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 years ago it wasn’t like this, I was with a long term relationship and a house and a great job and was making $300K a year in banking. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then 2 years ago, my mom passed away. Lead me down a a very depressed path. I found my comfort in alcohol and gambling to numb the pain. Emptied my bank accounts and just gave it away to random philanthropy places because I wanted to end my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ignored and pushed away the love of my life, my friends, and I don’t have my only family I had which was my mom. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in an apartment that’s past due by 30 days, and I have no electricity, and I can’t even land a job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is a monster and it’s 3am and I don’t know what to do or say or to even think…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for writing this. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve come to the conclusion lately that I do not want to live and function as an adult. I shouldn’t have to have any commitments or responsibilities. I should have died age 7. My life has been downhill since then. 

My parents loved - and still love - me so hard, it makes me hurt inside. I don’t know if that makes sense? I refuse to look for romantic love because the only people I want to care about are them. The more years I spend masking my true self (because nobody - nobody - would ever suspect I’m like this; me, the attractive, successful career woman who has bought her own apartment and been living independently for over ten years), the more I want to give it all up and just move back in with them and totally regress. I want to regress to the age I was when I didn’t know of negative emotions, or anxiety, of grief and loss. I want to be ignorant. I am both saddened and filled with rage that growing up happened. I want it to be just the three of us forever. To play with Barbies with my dad in the garden. I want to see colours as brightly as I used to. I want my mum to hold me tight. The love I experienced in my childhood is like a chokehold. On a bad day, old memories is all I can think about. I cycle through them in my brain and cry until I have no voice left.

I shouldn’t have to have any commitments or responsibilities. I should have died age 7. My life has been downhill since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My parents loved - and still love - me so hard, it makes me hurt inside. I don’t know if that makes sense? I refuse to look for romantic love because the only people I want to care about are them. The more years I spend masking my true self (because nobody - nobody - would ever suspect I’m like this; me, the attractive, successful career woman who has bought her own apartment and been living independently for over ten years), the more I want to give it all up and just move back in with them and totally regress. I want to regress to the age I was when I didn’t know of negative emotions, or anxiety, of grief and loss. I want to be ignorant. I am both saddened and filled with rage that growing up happened. I want it to be just the three of us forever. To play with Barbies with my dad in the garden. I want to see colours as brightly as I used to. I want my mum to hold me tight. The love I experienced in my childhood is like a chokehold. On a bad day, old memories is all I can think about. I cycle through them in my brain and cry until I have no voice left.&lt;/p&gt;

I have no hope in life right now. I have struggled with depression since I was 9 years old and I recently got my Asperger's diagnosis but even though I am in therapy nothing is helping. I am currently 18 years old and I had to move out when I was 17 because I had to go to another part of the country for vocational training. Since then, everything has been even harder for me. But the worst thing is that I have no future. I finished secondary school (I think that's what it's called in English), but because of my grades, I had to work in really bad jobs. Because of my autism, I can't keep up and I don't know what to do. I am in debt and barely have enough money to eat. My family won't help me, so I just feel so alone and like suicide is the only option left to me, since I have to quit everything I try out. I just want to go back home and go to a normal school again but I wasted every chance for a good life due to my mental health problems.

I have so many other feelings and problems, but I don't want to go into too much detail because it's all a bit complicated lol.

,SuicideWatch,"I usually don’t plan my suicide attempts. When I have attempted in the past it’s always for the most part been a spur of the moment thing. I am always depressed and suicidal but I push through until it gets to much. These past few months my depression has been worse than ever. I’ve recently attempted suicide. I feel like if I attempt again it’ll be over for me.

I’m an actor and I’ve recently been accepted to a really big project for my standards. The biggest I’ve ever done. And I have the most lines and everything. I’m was really excited but the past few days I’ve not been. And even though it’s 100% gonna happen I’ve been finding myself going “if I do the project” instead of “when”. A part of me feels like maybe I won’t. And today I got the script. Usually I’m so excited to read the whole script and I learn my lines straight away and usually have a lot of it learned in a few hours.

My father has been a very important person to me. He has been a single parent ever since my mother became obsessed with money to the point she turned to drugs and cheated on my father. I have been aware of my dad's struggles to keep the family together, worse now he is in his 60's with my brother with no job.

Now me, an extremely ungrateful son. I take everything for granted even though I believe otherwise. I always get what I wanted, from a new phone to a new PC. But at the end, I forget my dad is a person too. I always reply to him monotonously as if he is not my dad, speaking in a way like I want him gone and just not bother me anyone. I only say thank you when I got what I wanted, I rarely say love you to him. I tried spending time with him because you never know when he's gone but I never did. 

Few hours ago, my dad unlocked my door with a key and asked me if I ate already, I said I already did and to not use the key anymore and just at least knock in a disrespectful tone. I wish I could have said that differently to be honest. He lashed out and said he noticed how disrespectful I have been lately and that he gave everything to me even though he has been struggling at work as a single parent. I couldn't say anything but stare at him from my bed. After that he just slammed my door and left me feeling extremely guilty to the point I intent to k*ll myself that moment, I have constant thoughts of relieving the burden of being a spoiled brat. I grabbed my belt from my closet and tied it to a somewhat n*ose to hang it on a door and hang myself with. I thought of all the things that could happen if I ended it here right now. It could take a while for everyone to grieve, but the burden of having to put up to my shit is not there anymore. It felt like a win for everyone. But the thought of the pain made me hesitate, so I just went to self harm, sliding a small but sharp thread cutter along my arms. It felt liberating, to physically punish myself because no one will. 

Lately I've been struggling mentally, I starved myself as a form of punishment, even self harm. I wanted to run away from everyone, start a new life, a chance to change my disgusting behavior. But I'm still an upcoming college student, (19) no job, barely any savings. Why is it hard for me to accept that I'm extremely fucking lucky to have this life? Why do I have to bring others down? When I see my friends bond with their family, I always get so jealous even though I'm the problem. I really love my dad, but I can't seem to show it or act it.

I don't blame anyone but myself, so why is it hard for me to change my shitty self?

I was raped when I was 8 years old. I feel like after that my childhood was over. I don’t know why it still affects me now. It’s been more than half of my life. 

Whenever I see or hear things to do with my life before then I cry. I was so happy when I was a small child. 

I wish things could be that way again. If I was never raped my life would be so different. I wouldn’t be suicidal like I am now. I wouldn’t have grown up so fast. I would be happy. I would probably not have as bad mental health issues. My whole life could have been different. 

I wouldn’t still be having nightmares years later. Unable to keep long lasting friendships and relationships. Depending on drugs and alcohol so I don’t kill myself.

I know I wouldn’t still be laughing and playing barbies and dress up now but I would’ve naturally. Instead of for some reason just stopping after the trauma. 

I want to be that girl again. I don’t want to be an adult. I just want to be 7 years old again before my life was ruined. I want to play all day and watch Peppa pig with my sister who didn’t understand why I wouldn’t play with her anymore at the time. And I want to collect my little pony figures and draw with wash off glitter tattoo pens with my friends. Before they started to turn on me and bully me because I started to become weird after the trauma.

I never would’ve thought I’d turn out this way. No one did. I used to be kind and friendly and have morals. Now I steal all the time and have to be on something to cope all the time and I’m mean to people I care about all the time.

Hi, im Z, i have the thoughts and actions of Inc*st, sorry for the word, but yeah. It all started when I hit puberty, I had this older brother who i put my H*rniness into. I know its so wrong but its so hard to fight the urge. Until now I still do, But just last month, I had just realize its immoral, and such a big sin so i stopped (voyeur), after that, I still had the guts to do actions of Inc*st, I actually had been caught by my older brother, after that we act like nothing happened, we talk the same, we sometimes laugh together, so all goods on that i guess! As of right now, my addiction has been died down (I hope) I just really wanna move on pass by this, I need help. I need advice. Its so immoral i wanna move on. 

I read one Quora answer that its probably just because im young and bc of my hormones, and thats why I put my Older brother in that position, which I guess was true. I had a Mutual Understanding relationship once and I didnt bother to put attention to my Older brother, so i guess its true you know?

,SuicideWatch,"Hi all,

I seriously considered suicide at 18, but I figured I still had time to turn things around and I believed ppl when they said things will get better. Well, 4 years has passed and I’m in no better position now. During these four years I focused heavily on self improvement, including learning (for myself), grades(for school), and exercise. I didn’t go out to parties/clubs at all because I barely made any social connections throughout college. As such, I have no happy memories throughout these last four years. 

I have good grades, am in great shape, and I feel generally satisfied with the knowledge I know. My problem is that none of this helped me in my life. I have little work experience and as such I have no prospects for work. Initially I wanted to go to law school, but I realize now that despite putting so much effort into learning I am only above average at best in my intellect, and I can’t score very high on my LSAT despite working an ungodly amount of hours on studying for it. Because I can’t score high on my LSAT I can’t go to a good law school. My grades are splendid, but it turns out grades are not worth much in applying for grad school or getting a job. 

I have no friends and am developmentally behind in communicating with my peers, I developed a terrible stutter, and I don’t know how to socialize anymore. Recently I tried to put myself out there and talk to ppl, but they try to get rid of me as a friend as soon as possible. I have no friends now. Of course I have no romantic experience and no hope in ever getting into any romantic relationship because of my two problems above. I have been on dating apps for around three months, and nobody that I like is interested in me, and my standards are very low. Throughout my life I must have been rejected by 300+ girls online and around 10 in person, I was never ‘accepted’ (whatever the opposite of rejection is) by any. I consider myself pretty chill and I’m not some misogynistic lunatic or sex crazed deviant. And this is despite maxing everything I can in my personal life. Lastly, by reading so much philosophy I developed a value change, and I cannot connect to people because of it.

TLDR So I guess my question is when is it logical to call it quits. I have no career, romantic, or community prospects. Compared to 4 yrs ago I improved everything that was in my control, but I did not improve in any of the three fields I mentioned. Instead, now I have other problems I wasn’t struggling with before, namely being developmentally behind and having different values.

,SuicideWatch,"After deleting the last two posts I deleted on this subreddit maybe this one is gonna stay a bit longer. 
I'm 19 years old and I wanted to kill myself for about six years but never got closer to actually doing it than making a knot in a rope to hang myself or ""almost"" jumping of bridges as I don't have access to guns (if I had I'm very certain I would be dead already). 

Over the years I often kinda hurt myself (like slapping myself, carving my skin with sticks a little, putting my hands against hot stuff till I couldn't take it anymore) but never really viewed it as actual ""to be taken serious"" self harm because I didn't want to admit to myself that I need help. 
Last night I however took some scissors and cut my left arm in several locations and put lemon juice on the wounds so it would hurt more so I'd be able to ""escape"" my feelings. 
Long story short today I got up and took a shower and then noticed that there's visible cuts on my arm from last night (could've figured that was gonna happen earlier but I'm just a mess lately and it's affecting my thinking) and I realised I'll have to hide that wound because I don't know how I'd explain it. 

I also realised that I can no longer act like I have normal issues everybody has and I feel so guilty because I should be the stable factor for my girlfriend (she has bpd) but instead I'm a mess and on the verge of breaking up with her because I'm just on an overload of emotions even though I don't even have any excuse for being so depressed, as far as I know I don't even have any trauma??

Anyway I thought about getting help and talking to a therapist but I'm so scared to do that because therapists are also just people and I hate talking about my issues to other people, especially because I don't even understand what's wrong with myself. 

Is there any advice you have for me?

I&amp;#39;m 19 years old and I wanted to kill myself for about six years but never got closer to actually doing it than making a knot in a rope to hang myself or &amp;quot;almost&amp;quot; jumping of bridges as I don&amp;#39;t have access to guns (if I had I&amp;#39;m very certain I would be dead already). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the years I often kinda hurt myself (like slapping myself, carving my skin with sticks a little, putting my hands against hot stuff till I couldn&amp;#39;t take it anymore) but never really viewed it as actual &amp;quot;to be taken serious&amp;quot; self harm because I didn&amp;#39;t want to admit to myself that I need help.

Hi, I'm a 13 year old girl, I live with my mom and my dad left me when I was 6, honestly I couldn't care less for him. I can hardly remember him.

I got my phone smashed because I didn't make my younger sister food even though my mom told her to make it. My mom hasn't bought me a new phone yet, (its been 6 months).

I remember one time in year/grade 6 (when I was about 11/10 years old), I felt really shitty and I just wanted to end myself, all my friends left me and made rumours about me and I remember I told one of my sisters about it, she told me I was overreacting. Then I hid the note behind the couch I completely forgot about it. My mom found it a few days later, she began screaming at me, she was pissed. I just cried in my room. I've never felt so shitty. I've been losing my friends, being disruptive and getting high. I've had thoughts about killing my mom and family members whenever I felt shitty. I've had thoughts of stabbing myself over and over again. I just want to end it all. I've been self-harm free for 2 months. I really want to finish myself off, I just want to actually fucking die.

While I was struggling, I found out last week that I am being evicted in my permanent residence since I haven't fully paid the lot. What is more painful though is that neighbors and local officials produced documents containing fallacious information about me so they can have the lot.

it says to consider the death penalty for child sexual abusers. that's one thing. but when you consider that trans people are porn for existing and thus any child seeing a trans person would be ""exposed to porn""... yeah. 

the rest is a whole other can of worms that make me want to kms slightly less

i don't think most of you guys can understand what it's like to be despised and to have people want you dead and burning in hell and people praying for your downfall and to have the government take away your rights and lock you up/kill you. just for existing and helping yourself. for being different. be afraid walking alone. you shouldn't have to and i don't want you to. nobody should have to understand that.

i'm mentally ill with diagnosed depression, ptsd, agoraphobia, insomnia, and am on a cocktail of 5 meds that i can't live without. straight up can't sleep without one of them. last year i had to up my dosage on one 

i've considered moving to australia/nz but i'd be uprooting my whole life. i'd be so far away from my family and friends and time zones would mess up communication. then there's the visa process; i can't even go there without a visa. then what the hell am i gonna do about my medications? i can maybe go a day or two without most of them but i need my insomnia one daily

then what about study? i'm taking community college atm with plans to transfer to my state's most well known university and am admitted to it though not taking classes

the reason i am considering moving to australia/nz is work. there are some great resources for my interests connected to my major. i don't think canada offers that

in the past i have been able to talk myself out of it including guilting myself out of it. i've set goals to at least wait until whatever series i'm interested in ends but things are so bad i'm probably gonna end up ruling it out. i've been able to do that for around 10 years at this point but things are getting that bad

i've partially written a note but not a main one. been thinking of writing a full one just to get it out even if i don't do anything

i'm not really a direct danger to myself right now even if i am thinking of these things but i don't know how long that will last. whenever i think of doing my preferred method i always see myself telling someone and going to the hospital before anything super bad happens to me.

I am not good at studies sports or even communication. I am very scared of the future because I don't know if I can do anything. I have stopped even trying not because I am lazy or don't want to but because I am tired. I feel tired 24/7 I am on my phone glued to the screen 24/7 and i don't even feel like going out or socialize. i don't have many friends but I do have few close ones.

&lt;p&gt;I will die before I turn 30. I&amp;#39;d rather not live past this age and end up living to my 60s or 70s without ever finding a romantic partner. I know exactly who I am and I am absolutely certain that my life will stay this way if I don&amp;#39;t die while I&amp;#39;m still in my 20s. I am a strong believer in fatalism and I am certain that there is no future for me where I am happy and fulfilled, no matter how much time or effort I put into myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a few close friends in my life, but it will be very easy for them to find a replacement. I am very easy to replace as a person. There are many others like me in the world, and I am absolutely sure that everyone in my life will quickly get over my passing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very serious about this and I plan on withdrawing out of my retirement funds to purchase a shotgun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Been feeling this way since 14 years old with absolutely no end in sight. I have simply accepted that this will be my fate until I kill myself once my car is paid off. &lt;/p&gt;

44m

I relocated to Memphis TN last year for work from Nee Orleans LA. As soon as I set foot in this place, I kinda knew it wasn't for me - was not happy, but the work was good and I decided it would have to grow on me. I had came up BRIEFLY for a few weeks over the summer to get the transition lined up and made the permanent relocation in October.

So while I was on my temp summer jaunt, I went out for my birthday by myself to this little beer and pizza joint. There was this server who was absolutely beautiful - she wasn't MY server, but she kept making excuses to come by my table to talk. She was enchanting. She awkwardly spilled a bit of water on me and we laughed. After I left I thought little of it.

So then I move to the area permanently, find a local dive bar... and she is there. Still beautiful. She approaches me, we reconnect. Long story short, we very quickly fall in love.

She is my life. Everything she does is musical and magical. She doesn't even drink (always DD for her drunk sister, thus why at the bar) and tells me she decided to quit when she realized she didn't handle alcohol well. I respect it and tell her I'm haply to quit myself, or at least never do it around her - all she needs do is tell me, she's totally worth it. She tells me not to worry about it.

She moves in with me. I could not be happier.

We go out for dinner one night, she tells me she thinks she's in a good place to casually drink again. I tell her only she can make that decision, just make sure she feels right about it. Now here it gets a little weird, because I remember thinking ""this could be the start of bad things"" but I tried to push it out of my head.

Her drinking doesn't seem troublesome - for a while at least.

She winds up getting a job bartenders at the same dive we met in. She's excited and I support it, since the money is good, she wants to do it, and the location is super convenient. Another time when I wish I would have realized then that this was setting up for a massive failure later....

Slowly, her focus becomes more on staying out all night drinking than on anything else. I still do not suspect infidelity at all, as she would be extremely open about her activities, just staying out all night getting incredibly drunk and stumbling in 4-6am most nights. I work a high stress day job, but I tried to adjust the best I could.

Now she had always made no secret that she wanted to marry. And we had talked about it in detail and I wanted it as much if not more than her. She knew a proposal was coming soon and appeared to be thrilled about it.

So I booked the hotel for a week in New Orleans over July 4th, told her we would take a week so I could bring her to my hometown and show her where I come from (she had never been). I planned on proposing in front of St Louis Cathedral during the July 4th fireworks over the river. My plan was BARELY a secret. She essentially knew I was proposing. Again she was on cloud 9.

The Friday before we are scheduled to leave, she wants to go to Beale st to go out with me. I am somewhat reluctant (more concerned with the upcoming trip in 4 days) but I decide to take her out per request anyhow.

Then night falls apart.

She gets black out drunk. She mouths off to some Memphis police and almost gets us arrested. I tell her we have to go home because the cops are seriously considering taking us in because of her behavior. She unleashes hell on me. Calls me worthless. A failure. A piece of shit. She tries to get the streetcar co doctor not to let me on the car.... screams vulgarity at me in front of the other riders. She almost falls off the car when it stops and myself and a bystander catch her so she doesn't hurt herself. ""Get your fuckin hands off me"".

I tell her ""I can't fuckin do this. I can't marry this"".

She tries to swing on me several times in the middle of the street. 

I call her coworkers/bar buddies and tell them to come pick her up and I wait around the corner to ensure she's safe, then take an uber home.

They take her back to the bar and keep feeding her liquor. She comes in at sunup unintelligible drunk and passes out.

We try to talk that morning, she doesn't remember anything, but tells me I'm a monster for leaving her ""alone"" (I was still there till she left) downtown drunk and defenseless. I ask her where do we go from here - that this is her one chance to tell me what she wants, and I'll do it.

She chooses to avoid accountability and just berate me.

I go to New Orleans alone for the week.

It's horrible. I just sit on the river, stare at the barges and the bridge, and quietly drink by myself.

I return 2 weeks later, she's still at the house. I try to talk to her one more time, she avoids talking/accountability completely. I finally tell her we are over. She goes to work/late night drinking/whatever and STILL keeps coming to the house when she needs to. I finally tell her to not come back unless it's to get her personal belongings. 

....they're still here.

I return to work today after 2 weeks (my work knew about the proposal plans AND the complete failure that followed). I have to face all these people looking at me like I'm a broken wretch that is just waiting for the right moment to swan dive off the fuckin bridge.

It's awkward and humiliating.

I get to our job site. Discover that several of my coworkers actively despise me (by their own words). 

I am now stuck in this town that I never wanted to be in, lovelier than I have ever felt in my life, surrounded by shit that reminds me of her, just waiting till this lease expires and I can move back home to New Orleans.

I literally have no one here now. It is the coldest feeling I have ever experienced in my life. The only thing that keeps me holding on is that I know I'll be back home for Mardi Gras.

I'm a 25 year old woman, I have a girlfriend we're planning to get married, lots of friends and a supportive family. But I am miserable. Not because of anyone else. I just hate myself. I hate my brain. 

In 2022 things were generally going well for me. I was making and playing music consistently, I had two decent jobs and I was going out multiple times a week. I was raped at the end of that year and ever since I just haven't been able to pick up the pieces.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi there, I am not a native speaker so, yes, I really want to write down my story.

I am 26 and last year i divorced my marriage, we where together since I am 17.. so you see a long time. Nothing bad happend, we didn't cheat or something else. I'll guess it's my fault wasting his time. 

I grew up in a village from a good parent household. My parents know his parents and they always said, ohhh our children should be a couple, dream couple ... and and and... for some real we got pushed in this role, but I don't want to play a victim, it was my own decision (I guess) 

I was never really happy in this relationship, he knows, my parents knows, we had nothing similar. I am more that type of human ""spread love and help everyone"" and he was more like ""other humans problems are not my business"" (he's banker, you're problem is only his business when you need money) &lt; his favorite joke 

Ok - so in this RS, Marriage from 2014 to 2023 we seen a lot, we buyed a lot, 2 houses, moved 900 KM away from our home and much more. 

It's like I was sleeping and last year I woke up from a dream and don't want to life this live anymore, it's like a bubble popped and I tried so hard to suppress this unhappiness but... i couldn't. I divorced and he was ok. We don't have a fight or trouble, we are friends now. We don't had children together, just cat &amp; dog. (Our future goal was always, be richer then to others 😓)

Since then I am single and I don't sleep with someone else, because I feel like wtf how should this work with someone else? And I am a wife or I was a wife, I am too good for this hook up culture! 

.... Now I am here, feel completely lost, I don't want my old life back, but I feel like, I can't see the why for living. Why I am here, what todo. Anxiety haunt me everyday. 

From the outside I am strong / independent women. But in the inside I am a children. 

And I don't do drugs, no medicine, alcohol, no smoking... I eat healthy and still feel so depressed. 😔 

I feel like I don't know who I am.. where I am be and and and. All my friends have BC 30+
Wtf I was all this time married and had no time for this, when they where drunk at party's I was at work, nursed my dad and cooked for my husband! (No we are not a religious cult or something like this, we are not religious) 

I really feel lost, I feel like shit but my old life was not good at all too. My old life was a golden cage.

I don't know, I really feel like everyone around me is in a dream bubble and I am the only one who is awake 🥲

And I feel so much guilt and shame, how much time I waste in his life. I mean yes I was always honestly about my unhappiness, but I was never brave enough to go. 

I literally destroyed 2 lives, mine and his. I wish I could suppress my emotions and feelings and life with him until we are old. But over the years it got everything so worse, that I didn't wanted that he touch me anymore. But I was always loyal! I never cheated. 

Omg my head feel so sick 🤢

&lt;p&gt;I am 26 and last year i divorced my marriage, we where together since I am 17.. so you see a long time. Nothing bad happend, we didn&amp;#39;t cheat or something else. I&amp;#39;ll guess it&amp;#39;s my fault wasting his time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew up in a village from a good parent household. My parents know his parents and they always said, ohhh our children should be a couple, dream couple ... and and and... for some real we got pushed in this role, but I don&amp;#39;t want to play a victim, it was my own decision (I guess) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was never really happy in this relationship, he knows, my parents knows, we had nothing similar. I am more that type of human &amp;quot;spread love and help everyone&amp;quot; and he was more like &amp;quot;other humans problems are not my business&amp;quot; (he&amp;#39;s banker, you&amp;#39;re problem is only his business when you need money) &amp;lt; his favorite joke &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok - so in this RS, Marriage from 2014 to 2023 we seen a lot, we buyed a lot, 2 houses, moved 900 KM away from our home and much more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like I was sleeping and last year I woke up from a dream and don&amp;#39;t want to life this live anymore, it&amp;#39;s like a bubble popped and I tried so hard to suppress this unhappiness but... i couldn&amp;#39;t. I divorced and he was ok. We don&amp;#39;t have a fight or trouble, we are friends now. We don&amp;#39;t had children together, just cat &amp;amp; dog. (Our future goal was always, be richer then to others 😓)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then I am single and I don&amp;#39;t sleep with someone else, because I feel like wtf how should this work with someone else? And I am a wife or I was a wife, I am too good for this hook up culture! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;.... Now I am here, feel completely lost, I don&amp;#39;t want my old life back, but I feel like, I can&amp;#39;t see the why for living. Why I am here, what todo. Anxiety haunt me everyday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the outside I am strong / independent women. But in the inside I am a children. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I don&amp;#39;t do drugs, no medicine, alcohol, no smoking... I eat healthy and still feel so depressed. 😔 &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don’t see a point anymore. every time i get better, every time i feel happy, i get knocked on my ass again. i can’t handle this grief anymore, i can’t handle anymore trauma. i just want the pain to stop. i want to be normal and happy, but i guess that’s just not in the cards for me…&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"This is dumb and stupid but I don’t care. I am so tired and i need to vent

I (16m) have had a shitty life. I know others had it worse. I know i am probably so lucky. I know i should suck it up and deal with it and actually get a life but im sick of this. Im sick.  
My whole life was basically spent on the internet. It raised me. It ruined and saved me. I wish my parents broke my electronics when i was younger and never looked back. Or maybe i just wish they were better parents. I wish they actually loved me.

they might say they do, but they don’t. My mom is controlling, strict, annoying and so, so mean to me. She fills me up with sweet nothings then she breaks me down to my core. My dad is basically not there. He’s present but not really. He’s distant emotionally and im terrified of him. He used to beat me and my siblings and he says he feels bad, he regrets it but he doesn’t. I don’t forgive him. If he truly felt bad he would make up for it but he doesn’t. He works all day long and is so tired all the time and i just don’t know. I will never forget that day where he yelled at me and my brother, basically threatened to kill him because he was trans, “if the government doesn’t kill you, i will” he said. He threw things and made me, my brother and my mother cry. He put his hand in my brothers private part and told him he had female genitalia so he was female. He said “and don’t you dare say you have trauma because of that.” I hugged my mom and told her that i was so sorry. She should be sorry. She did nothing to stop him. She is his accomplice. If they found out anything about me, that im trans or bi, they would ruin our lives. They have done it before. That I’m autistic, “you can’t have autism because you’re smart and autism is a disability and you dont have a disability. You can’t be autistic because you can function.” Was basically what my mom told me. I live on eggshells because they are around.

i have struggled mentally for basically my entire life. I have so many toxic tendencies, I struggle to stay alive every single day. I don’t know how much longer i can do this. But my siblings, i can’t leave them but i want to.  
i have no future. I’m lazy i really am, i like to draw but i can never seem to be able to open up the drawing App. I like to write but i can’t seem to actually bother. I want to start commissions but nothing is working, i’m so useless and worthless. Everything i’ve ever touched gets ruined. I’m a bad omen.

so i left all my friends, and my partner. Like i said, my whole life was spent on the internet. So obviously, i have had many online friends over the years. I met my best friend on the internet. All my relationships were on the internet. Almost everything that mattered was and is on the internet. when i was 14, i met this boy, and fell in love. I was ruined, and he broke me. Almost a year of my life was wasted on him. Then when i left him, he called me the n-slur (classy) then said it was because he was having a bad day afterwards. When i blocked him, he sent his friend to talk to me, tell me he was suffering and that he attempted and was acting shitty in school just so i can pity him and go back to him. But I didn’t. I know it was just some dumb teenage relationship but i was genuinely never the same afterwards. I still sent him one last message giving him advice and his friend said he got better. I blocked him a while after, too. I‘m glad i helped when nobody helped me. Well, they tried. I guess i really am selfish and stubborn, what ugly personality traits. Afterwards, i met them. I wish i could say when i did, it was perfect and i was happy. But i wasn’t. I self-harmed again, for the first time after dating that boy. I had my first panic attacks. I so desperately didn’t want to experience what i did with that boy, i guess. I confessed and we started dating. I loved them truly, i still do. I still love them. But i was rarely truly happy. Maybe if i was more open, but I refused to open up. I lied and lied and lied. I never felt so fake in my life. I self-harmed the most in that period. One hour i’ll be feeling an all-time high with them, the other they say one thing that upsets me and i fully shut down. I’ve never cried this much except with that boy. I would ignore them for hours, days, because i could not text them after being upset and I couldn’t open up. I know its my fault and i fucked im and i feel bad. Sometimes being with them felt like my heart was genuinely burning in my chest, not in the good way. I truly don’t know how to explain how it feels. I almost attempted suicide. I’ll never forget the true happiness i felt when I convinced myself i’d go through with it. a relief that cannot be explained. I’ll never forget my 16th birthday. It was such, such a good day. But then it progressively got worse. I sent my ex partner a drawing my brother drew for me. “He looks like he lives in his mothers basement.” It was meant as a joke, i know. But it hurt. “That’s so mean!” “How is it mean?” “ykw forget it” I spent that night crying on the floor and i selfharmed. I do not know what‘s wrong with me. I just felt like they didn’t care, just like he never did. I don’t know. I truly don’t understand either.  
so i left everyone, all my online friends, my partner. My best friend. I miss my best friend. My rock, my light, my life. My atlantis, as they said. my true family. My support system, the one who was always there.  
i just couldn’t do it anymore. It was for the better, they would all be better off without me.  
im ill, and broken, and a bad person, ugly and stupid, and truly, no one truly would want me. They say they do but i know better. They are better off without me.  
it hasn’t even been that long since i left and im so fucking done with everything. I feel so empty. I don’t even know, i feel nothing and everything at the same time. I still feel like im living 2 lives. One in my head, in the internet. The other with my family, the real world.  
Sometimes i regret leaving and sometimes im glad. All the times i wish i was dead.  
I don’t even cry anymore. I just cannot feel enough to cry. Like I genuinely can’t, i tried, but i cannot. Every single day i wish i was dead. I have no future in life. I want to study abroad, in canada or something, but my mother truly does not believe in me. I do not believe in myself. I have no money and it’s illegal for minors to work where i live. I’ll try to do well in school in the future but im not so sure. A scholarship is not very easy to get. I don’t want to stay here, i want to leave. I can’t stand it here anymore.  
for everyday of my life, i am trying. For every person, i tried to be the sunshine and make them happy. Let them lean on me i tried to be their light. I loved it and i was happy but i need that too. Everyday, slowly that light in me dwindled. Im scared it does not exist anymore, im scared i’ll never reach that kind, happy, cheerful, go-lucky girly person again. Im broken and a mess. And this is pathetic I know. Im pathetic. Maybe its my fault, i never really allowed myself to be vulnerable. I remember letting my siblings cry in my arms but i never cried in theirs. But im the oldest after all, i guess it only makes sense. Im supposed to be strong. Im trying. I wish i could muster to take pills and leave them. They are my only reason for staying. I have given up on everyone, i have no one in my life. Maybe i’ll do it when they don’t need me anymore.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m not a troll this is genuinely what I’ve been going through the past 2 years.

I’m nearly 18 and 2 years ago when I was 16 I was in a really bad place. I was depressed and isolated myself in my room every single day for nearly the whole year. I was dealing with other issues at the time which led to this. I had been watching porn 1-2 times a day since I was 10  but when I isolated myself it went up to 2-3 times a day. I always knew I was straight and never thought differently. I have seen gay porn and trans porn before and it doesn’t turn me on at all as I don’t like it.

When I was depressed and watched a lot of porn, I ended up looking at pictures of a feminine looking man that was in a bikini and had surgery to look like a woman. There was no nudity involved and I was only focusing on the butt nothing else. I did this a few more times over the next few months (probably only another 5 times within 3-4 months). 

After the last time, the regret suddenly sunk in and since then I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and honestly I hate myself for doing this stuff.

I’m not trying to be homophobic. I just always knew I was straight. Since I realised my actions, I look at the pictures to see if I’m still aroused by them, but each time I am disgusted by them.

I feel straight again and I honestly do not ever desire to look at those pictures ever again, but I also feel like I am unable to be straight again after the actions I had done in the past.

Is it possible for me to be straight like I was before? I genuinely do not have any desire to do it again and I regret it so much. I’ve been suicidal for nearly two years I just can’t cope with what I had done.

&lt;p&gt;After the last time, the regret suddenly sunk in and since then I’ve been dealing with suicidal thoughts and honestly I hate myself for doing this stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to be homophobic. I just always knew I was straight. Since I realised my actions, I look at the pictures to see if I’m still aroused by them, but each time I am disgusted by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel straight again and I honestly do not ever desire to look at those pictures ever again, but I also feel like I am unable to be straight again after the actions I had done in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for me to be straight like I was before? I genuinely do not have any desire to do it again and I regret it so much. I’ve been suicidal for nearly two years I just can’t cope with what I had done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not trolling or anything I’m being genuine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for sounding like a bigot or a troll honestly I did this to myself and now I don’t want to live.&lt;/p&gt;

I started recently with a therapist where I suggested inpatient therapy as an option, which she refused to entertain because she thinks I don’t need it.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm honestly just here to vent.

Recently I got into a very minor traffic accident,  literally just a fender bender, but it was so triggering for me that I attempted (and failed miserably due to using an ineffective method) . Not just the accident itself was triggering, but the girl I hit called her uncle, (who was a fucking former prosecuter) over it and she decided to make me go to court because of him!!!! :D nobody in my family went to college or knows the law. How is that fair??  so anyway I went to court, and then I had to take a driving class where for some reason the police Sergent is allowed to show a bunch of 16-24 year olds real gore of real people dying in wrecks!!! :D I was the only person there who wasn't there for going 20 over the fucking speed limit!!! :D

I also am so fucking stupid and braindead that I managed to forget to appear in court last Thursday to simply acknowledge that i listened to an old geezer complain about how hard it is to be a cop and scrape peoples bodies off of hot pavement. I'm gonna call the court clerk in about three hours and see if I can fix it today. I won't get any sleep tonight. I would've if I could've forgotten for just a little while longer.

 After that, I have to drive almost an hour away to visit some office for a new job which will pay me barely enough money to live, take money out of my check to pay for licensing or something and health insurance. I remember when I first heard someone say that 15/hr was the bare minimum of what you need to live off of and thinking 15 was a lot. It's low. It's nothing, actually.

 I'm gonna go to college in the fall, on top of a full time overnight job, so that I can get some useless degree, because no matter which major I choose I feel like every market is flooded and I'll just end up making people's coffee.

 Especially considering that all I want to be in life is an artist. All I care about is creating art. But unfortunately, I feel like there are so many talented people that mine would be lost in the noise. I'm good at it but so is everyone else, including fucking AI apparently. I told someone that I was gonna major in graphic design and they deadass laughed in my face and told me to do something else because of ai. By the way, I think that people who can't tell the difference between ai and genuine art at least 80 percent of the time should not be allowed to vote.

And the worst part is I don't want either type of work, coffee or cushy. And I don't understand why that is so controversial to say. Why do you people dream of sucking off your bosses? I just want to swim in the lake by the dock with my best friends. I want to get a house for all of us to live in. I want to have fun and be young like I've never had the chance to before.

But I won't be able to afford that, because apparently the generations before mine were too retarded to create a sustainable and functioning economic system. The same people who care more about trumps stupid ear than 35,000 dead Palestinian people. The same people who literally unironically think Donald Trump was sent by God to ""save america"". From what?? Civil rights? And don't even get me started on how hot it's getting outside. Or how they keep finding microplastics in placentas.

I'm just so fucking angry because I just got here and everything is too fucking expensive. Old people complain about prices, but you at least had some time before during non recession periods to save something up. I have nothing. Once my grandma dies I will have nowhere to live, and I will have to scrap and struggle for every dime. And I never even got to be a teenager because of a fucking plague. I had no fun.

Almost a month ago I lost my childhood 13 years old dog, and after that everything came back to me &lt;- this is a very important thing to see the world fromy my side

At The beginning of 2020 I was super stresfull abot the virus, it took me like 2 or 3 month to function like a normal person.

After that, the UA vs RU happened and I think it's destroyed my mind completely. I wasn't able to think about anything else busides the war that is happening near my country border.
About 1 to 1.5 year later I was able to function normally like with the virus, but the war thing was a way worse. 
I was wiking up in the middle of the night hearing the freaking tanks or air raid siren (it was in my head only), I had to took some sleeping pills to be able to sleep over 6 hours.

And now, after my dog died - everything came back to me. Now I'm even afraid of freaking thunders (I was never afraid of them).

I'm paranoid almost about everything.
I was talking with psychologist 2 or 3 days after my dog died, she just told me that I'm a strong person and I just need some time.

Almost a month ago, everything is still very hard for me, sometimes even harder than after the sad news.

I don't really know what I should do, I have ultra mixed feelings - but I don't feel the happiness as I use to felt it before everything.

If someone had similar experience, please help me because I'm really loosing my mind ;(",t2_14mm92zodp,False,,0,False,Please help me,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e4bldi,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,False,,False,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1721091611.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost a month ago I lost my childhood 13 years old dog, and after that everything came back to me &amp;lt;- this is a very important thing to see the world fromy my side&lt;/p&gt;

he also thinks I'm gay just because I don't go outside (that's not a joke he seriously had a conversation with me about that but even after explaining myself and how going outside doesn't make you straight he concludes that i am indeed gay, spoiler alert, i am not), then he starts trying to argue out of nowhere blaming me for his own faults like ""only if you were there but you weren't so it's your fault even though you're taking a dump when it happened it's your fault"" and whatever my brother does that's wrong I'm still included when i have got nothing to do with that situation but when it's only me it's just me.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello everyone,

I've never used the internet this way, but today I hope it will be beneficial because I really feel that I need it. Let's start...

I am a young man, an only child, who recently turned 20. I lived with my father and mother until I was 19, but one day my mother left home for another man. This affected me greatly because we were a very close-knit family of three, and it affected my father even more. Today, it's almost been five months since I found my father deceased by suicide. That day, he left me a letter that I will simplify: he told me that he adored me and that I couldn't even imagine how much, and that he was very proud of me. He then told me to never stop, to continue and reach my dreams, and that he would always be there with me, anywhere, anytime, he would accompany me. But he also said something: he was sorry for not being the father I would have wanted. Yet he knew very well how proud I was of him and how much I loved him. He was the center of my universe. But knowing my father, he always wanted more for his family and convinced himself that he wasn't good for me. But if he knew how perfect he was in my eyes...

Today, I live with my uncle (my father's brother) and my cousins. Why am I not with my mother? Because everything happened so quickly: my mother, the loss of my father... It wasn't the right time for me to live with her and her new man. And recently, I learned from a reliable source that she had cheated on my father before leaving him, so I am very confused with everything I'm going through. I know that time will heal things, but time moves forward for me and no longer for my father, and that enrages me.

Now, the real reason for this post is that I too am now thinking about ending this life of suffering. There's not a day that goes by without me thinking about it. Currently, I only continue for my father, my family, and my friends... but what about me in all this? When I sit down and take two minutes, I really struggle to see the beauty in this life. Yes, I have dreams and ambitions, but it seems like nothing makes sense anymore, everything tastes nostalgic... I've thought of ways to end it and the places, but only in thought, so I haven't taken any actions yet, but I feel it could happen... I want to live, but I have such a bitter taste from my experience on this earth now. When I argue, for example with my uncle, even over simple things, I automatically think: what's the point in continuing? I realize that I'm really staying here for my loved ones. I could probably write to you endlessly, but I'll stop here for now. It did me good to write this.

,SuicideWatch,"I've been fighting with my girlfriend a lot lately. She never wants to talk. Is stressed out by everything. I just want to support her, but I can't help her if she doesn't know what's wrong. She makes me feel bad for wanting to spend time with her or telling her I love her. We haven't had physical or emotional intimacy in about a month.

Truth be told I don't know what happened. We are in a poly relationship. She had another relationship end recently. Part of our rules were that we just don't talk about our jealousy issues. I suspect she's just not telling me anything because she's worried ill make it about myself. I know its too late for that. 

I told her today that I'd be there whenever she does want to talk. That it doesn't have to be today or tomorrow.

But every day fills me with more and more and more sadness and what feels like my relationship just falling apart. Its hard. We both need therapy. We both need communication and support. She at least has friends. I have nothing like that. If she stops talking to me about things I just don't even wants to think about it.

I want somebody to tell me its okay to tell my girlfriend I love her and that its okay to feel sad about the distance that has grown between us.

She never wants to talk. Is stressed out by everything. I just want to support her, but I can&amp;#39;t help her if she doesn&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s wrong. She makes me feel bad for wanting to spend time with her or telling her I love her. We haven&amp;#39;t had physical or emotional intimacy in about a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told I don&amp;#39;t know what happened. We are in a poly relationship. She had another relationship end recently. Part of our rules were that we just don&amp;#39;t talk about our jealousy issues. I suspect she&amp;#39;s just not telling me anything because she&amp;#39;s worried ill make it about myself. I know its too late for that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I told her today that I&amp;#39;d be there whenever she does want to talk. That it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be today or tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But every day fills me with more and more and more sadness and what feels like my relationship just falling apart. Its hard. We both need therapy. We both need communication and support. She at least has friends. I have nothing like that. If she stops talking to me about things I just don&amp;#39;t even wants to think about it.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"33M early child hood trauma ruined my life before it even started 


I honestly don't know where to start, but for background my mom left when I was probably in 1st or 2nd grade, just straight up moved to England ""mom is moving to england love you bye"" and left me with an abusive father. Dad taught me about porn at around age 8 or 9. I was molested by three different individuals (sons, or nephews of women he dated) between ages of most likely 11-14. One of them actually tw raping me. 

I've always been shorter in stature, and was picked on all throughout school. Something that did not help, as well was that my dad had a habit of approaching any girl around my age, in public to ask them if they wanted to date me. This started happening around 4th grade. ( Around the time my dad introduced me to porn). He would approach almost any girl, rather it be someone at the grocery store, it be someone selling girl scout cookies, it could be cheerleaders but he would do this routinely to the point that I would be ridiculed at school for this behavior. Of course, these girls would decline, or be like ew no gross, and I was often ""fake asked out"" a lot and would have things thrown at me, or like chocolate milk dumped on my head. This lead to a very strong fear of women, and fear of rejection I still deal with. 

My dad was also verbally, and emotionally, and physically abusive. If I would talk back he would shove me against a wall, and put his forearm against my throat and slap me, spit in my mouth, lick my face. He would tell me that no one would love me, and would use the girls going ew gross as examples and proof. I was also physically weaker than most other kids my age, due to a neurological condition that caused me to be under-developed, lacked coordination. 

One of my primary outlets, has always been the computer. Anime, video game type stuff. Fantasy stuff.  A habit I had picked up, was chatroom roleplaying in the late 90s, early 2000s in the AOL/Yahoo days, that started when I lived with my dad. I eventually ran away, to a different state, where a girl I was speaking with I had a crush on lived where my mom had moved back to and my grandma lived. I continued this habit after I moved, the summer after my freshman year and because I didn't know anyone I kept the habit of really having a majority of my social life on yahoo chat/aol.  

I was eventually groomed by an older woman, when I was like 16 into liking femdom type roleplay. This mostly hit a few dopamine receptors in whatever my most likely un-diagnosed autistic brain where I didn't have to ""guess"" if a girl was into me or not, if she was the one ""bossing"" me around. 

I stopped talking to this woman, my junior year, after a girl I went to school with admitted to liking me and we talked and dated for an extremely short time, all of it ending when she kissed me and I froze completely mostly due to being a completely anxious buffoon, but also due to my body having a fear/anxiety response from all the previous trauma/molestation where I just completely froze. She stopped talking to me not long after, and started calling me a pussy after I revealed some of the previous information about my past/dad to her as to ""why"" I froze. Also because I was 17 almost 18 and this was the first girl, and I still think only girl, to ever actually show any genuine interest me and I still regret dropping the ball on this. ( Though, she was known as a serial cheater, has 3 different baby daddy's now but I hold no ill will to her as she has had an extremely hard laugh and I ""recognized her scars"" which is why I fell for her back then. )

To be honest, high school after I moved was 10000x better and I actually came out of my shell even though I still had a lot of healing to do, unfortunately with a neglectful mom, and step-dad who didn't recognize, or care to recognize obvious signs of needing therapy. ( mom didn't know about the extent of the abuse back then, just the physical, but I still should have been in therapy. ) 

After highschool, and going to college I did get a car thankfully gifted to me from an older woman in my grandmas community. But I was 100% locked down to the house and could hardly go anywhere. (This was around 2010 and job market in my area sucked and I didn't actually get a job until 2014. mostly because I went to college but no job experience early on even for McDonalds wouldn't hire me, really hurt me, also because I was a quiet/nervous stammering idiot. )  

Eventually during college because my parents didn't allow me to go anywhere, took my keys etc, I fell back into habits of going online, and roleplaying. A user from the yahoo days had made a site for roleplay that was adult oriented though I rarely did anything of that except with people I had written with for awhile, and I started going there again. This is an action I regret to this day. 

Eventually, some drama started between me, and a different user where he started posing as me instigating drama/telling people I was drama. He accused me of harassing myself, eventually proved this wasn't the case, but drama from him posing as me continued, and eventually linked back to an account that was a more smut/sex RP account that was extremely oriented to violence against women, non-con, type writing (meaning he wanted someone to write as a woman for him to basically abuse.) Not kink shaming, but dude was/is a weirdo. Exposed this fact that the account was his and I started receiving threats that he was going to ruin my life. 

For years on that site I had him posing as me, stealing characters I made and making profiles as them to pose as me, mass spamming/block evading people posing as me to stir drama, to the point that he also found out information about me IRL and harassed IRL friends.

I lost a lot of friends due to the nature of the harassment, and the drama surrounding it. My response to it. ( A lot of validation seeking, are you mad at me, it isn't me please believe me type stuff. I was probably 24-ish around this time. ) Around this time, I had actually gone to the cops, but was given nothing more than a cyberbullying pamphlet. Told they couldn’t help me. Contact the FBI, I did but never got a response. There was also a rape accusation as well where my female friends were messaged from someone saying "" OP raped my friend"".  I went to a lawyer about this, and because I was a dirt-poor college student at the time and as no actual criminal accusation had been made was to ignore it. Was told specifically "" you'd be a fucking idiot to walk into a police station and say "" i got accused of rape, but its a lie please help me "" you'd be stuck in jail "" and because I couldn't afford a criminal lawyer, nor a lawyer to help me with the false accusations it was best to just drop it. 

I stopped taking care of myself, I gained over 70lbs probably over the course by just not caring.

I'm now 33, and because of the severe depression I have from all of this have to spend about 25k to get dental implants because I've completely let myself go. Bright side, I'm down from my all time high of 235lbs to 205-ish and hoping to get back down to 150 before end of year or at least this time next year. I think a lot of what I lose was water weight.

&lt;p&gt;I honestly don&amp;#39;t know where to start, but for background my mom left when I was probably in 1st or 2nd grade, just straight up moved to England &amp;quot;mom is moving to england love you bye&amp;quot; and left me with an abusive father. Dad taught me about porn at around age 8 or 9. I was molested by three different individuals (sons, or nephews of women he dated) between ages of most likely 11-14. One of them actually tw raping me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve always been shorter in stature, and was picked on all throughout school. Something that did not help, as well was that my dad had a habit of approaching any girl around my age, in public to ask them if they wanted to date me. This started happening around 4th grade. ( Around the time my dad introduced me to porn). He would approach almost any girl, rather it be someone at the grocery store, it be someone selling girl scout cookies, it could be cheerleaders but he would do this routinely to the point that I would be ridiculed at school for this behavior. Of course, these girls would decline, or be like ew no gross, and I was often &amp;quot;fake asked out&amp;quot; a lot and would have things thrown at me, or like chocolate milk dumped on my head. This lead to a very strong fear of women, and fear of rejection I still deal with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My dad was also verbally, and emotionally, and physically abusive. If I would talk back he would shove me against a wall, and put his forearm against my throat and slap me, spit in my mouth, lick my face. He would tell me that no one would love me, and would use the girls going ew gross as examples and proof. I was also physically weaker than most other kids my age, due to a neurological condition that caused me to be under-developed, lacked coordination. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my primary outlets, has always been the computer. Anime, video game type stuff. Fantasy stuff.  A habit I had picked up, was chatroom roleplaying in the late 90s, early 2000s in the AOL/Yahoo days, that started when I lived with my dad. I eventually ran away, to a different state, where a girl I was speaking with I had a crush on lived where my mom had moved back to and my grandma lived. I continued this habit after I moved, the summer after my freshman year and because I didn&amp;#39;t know anyone I kept the habit of really having a majority of my social life on yahoo chat/aol.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was eventually groomed by an older woman, when I was like 16 into liking femdom type roleplay. This mostly hit a few dopamine receptors in whatever my most likely un-diagnosed autistic brain where I didn&amp;#39;t have to &amp;quot;guess&amp;quot; if a girl was into me or not, if she was the one &amp;quot;bossing&amp;quot; me around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped talking to this woman, my junior year, after a girl I went to school with admitted to liking me and we talked and dated for an extremely short time, all of it ending when she kissed me and I froze completely mostly due to being a completely anxious buffoon, but also due to my body having a fear/anxiety response from all the previous trauma/molestation where I just completely froze. She stopped talking to me not long after, and started calling me a pussy after I revealed some of the previous information about my past/dad to her as to &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; I froze. Also because I was 17 almost 18 and this was the first girl, and I still think only girl, to ever actually show any genuine interest me and I still regret dropping the ball on this. ( Though, she was known as a serial cheater, has 3 different baby daddy&amp;#39;s now but I hold no ill will to her as she has had an extremely hard laugh and I &amp;quot;recognized her scars&amp;quot; which is why I fell for her back then. )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, high school after I moved was 10000x better and I actually came out of my shell even though I still had a lot of healing to do, unfortunately with a neglectful mom, and step-dad who didn&amp;#39;t recognize, or care to recognize obvious signs of needing therapy. ( mom didn&amp;#39;t know about the extent of the abuse back then, just the physical, but I still should have been in therapy. ) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After highschool, and going to college I did get a car thankfully gifted to me from an older woman in my grandmas community. But I was 100% locked down to the house and could hardly go anywhere. (This was around 2010 and job market in my area sucked and I didn&amp;#39;t actually get a job until 2014. mostly because I went to college but no job experience early on even for McDonalds wouldn&amp;#39;t hire me, really hurt me, also because I was a quiet/nervous stammering idiot. )  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually during college because my parents didn&amp;#39;t allow me to go anywhere, took my keys etc, I fell back into habits of going online, and roleplaying. A user from the yahoo days had made a site for roleplay that was adult oriented though I rarely did anything of that except with people I had written with for awhile, and I started going there again. This is an action I regret to this day. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, some drama started between me, and a different user where he started posing as me instigating drama/telling people I was drama. He accused me of harassing myself, eventually proved this wasn&amp;#39;t the case, but drama from him posing as me continued, and eventually linked back to an account that was a more smut/sex RP account that was extremely oriented to violence against women, non-con, type writing (meaning he wanted someone to write as a woman for him to basically abuse.) Not kink shaming, but dude was/is a weirdo. Exposed this fact that the account was his and I started receiving threats that he was going to ruin my life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years on that site I had him posing as me, stealing characters I made and making profiles as them to pose as me, mass spamming/block evading people posing as me to stir drama, to the point that he also found out information about me IRL and harassed IRL friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I lost a lot of friends due to the nature of the harassment, and the drama surrounding it. My response to it. ( A lot of validation seeking, are you mad at me, it isn&amp;#39;t me please believe me type stuff. I was probably 24-ish around this time. ) Around this time, I had actually gone to the cops, but was given nothing more than a cyberbullying pamphlet. Told they couldn’t help me. Contact the FBI, I did but never got a response. There was also a rape accusation as well where my female friends were messaged from someone saying &amp;quot; OP raped my friend&amp;quot;.  I went to a lawyer about this, and because I was a dirt-poor college student at the time and as no actual criminal accusation had been made was to ignore it. Was told specifically &amp;quot; you&amp;#39;d be a fucking idiot to walk into a police station and say &amp;quot; i got accused of rape, but its a lie please help me &amp;quot; you&amp;#39;d be stuck in jail &amp;quot; and because I couldn&amp;#39;t afford a criminal lawyer, nor a lawyer to help me with the false accusations it was best to just drop it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I stopped taking care of myself, I gained over 70lbs probably over the course by just not caring. Not going out, because I didn’t want to run into people like I knew who were harassed, or other individuals who were targeted and have these things brought up, because as a nervous, shy guy, with a stutter if I was confronted, I didn’t have proof of any of the stuff at the time, I didn’t want to admit “oh yeah I was groomed as a kid, and later as an adult started going on a cyber/smut roleplay site for adults where a psycho stalker got mad I outed him for liking to do rape stories and decided to ruin my life because I found out hes a freak” because that would have resolved the situation, or not have completely scared people off.

But these short and meaningless connections i made online i realized how much i just can't live in the real world. I wasn't meant to live.

I am so stupid and confused that i don&amp;#39;t even know who i am anymore. My whole life i only dissapointed and annoyed people around me. I see that i have no chance in this world because of how i feel about myself. I can&amp;#39;t stand it but i&amp;#39;m so afraid to die. What happens afterwards? Nobody knows until it happens. I&amp;#39;m so so scared but so alone about it. I got used to thinking about it, hurting myself and trying to do it a couple of times. But of course i failed, i can&amp;#39;t even die right. There&amp;#39;s really no point in my posts throughout the years being online, trying to find a connection i never had in real life.

 Your may have family, a house, friends?

My boyfriend hung himseff because of this, left me in debit holding the bag. They forclosed on my house, but lienholder said I could stay and rent it. The owner died, left him her millions, and iimmediately wants to sell it. After he bought it for $75,000 and being a contractor,  remolded everthing, so it now worth $375,000 so he wants to make money, now! Im waiting for my notice to get out. And have no family to go too. Or talk to, we had each other.

 I cant even do laundry, or have a car, he bought me a new car for us, I couldn't afford his car and his truck. I have to get car rides with strangers and it's a 2 hour drive to the drs.

 I am on disability,  for many conditions, he took care of me, now I have no one. I live in the seirras and we did all the landscaping have a guest house i went to cause it was too much to sit what was his house. But they can live off $1040 a month. I already had severe anxiety,  agoraphobia,  your house is your safe spot. But rent is too high, only a bedroom to rent with 3 cats and a dog. We used to throw the ball down the hill 3 times and he was pooped, but living in a room in a city with roomstes and a big fog, 3 cats that are indoor only, they are scared of people, they try to sneak out. I will be a prisoner in a bedroom with no bathroom with ibd, so if you gotta go, u cant wait for people to get out of the bathroom,  been there, done that, its HORRIBLE.  Im now 55, can't rock out in my bedroom, cant have pets. They are all i have.

,SuicideWatch,"This year has been the worst year for me. I had to leave the city that I loved, along with the community and friends I had, and move back home due to visa issues and my parents' health. I’m now faced with the possibility of changing careers (I worked in film) to support my wife and child, as it's not stable or lucrative here. This might mean abandoning my dream of becoming a film director due to external pressures( i come from a conservative community so film is looked down upon), and I’ve been feeling like a failure seeing all my old friends and relatives in higher positions while I struggle to stay financially afloat every day.

I thought this would be the year I finally made the film I worked so hard to write and assemble a team for (I've been pretending that I’m doing well and have just been focused on my film this year). However, it’s been impossible to juggle my dreams with having a family, addressing my parents' needs, finishing our house repairs, finding a potential job to make money, working on my film, and dealing with other personal emotional problems. 

This year, everything has fallen apart, and it has felt like a battle. Nothing has been simple, and I’m tired. I tried following my dreams, but I’m starting to doubt my abilities and whether I’ll ever reach where I want to be in life or be able to give my family the life they deserve. Maybe I’m too old to make it; maybe I missed my chance. 

I imagine life would be easier if my wife had married someone else and not me, a failed artist, or if I died so they could move on without needing to support me and my unrealistic dreams and expectations in life, maybe i’m just another failed dreamer that wasn’t tough enough to go all they way or able to sacrifice to make his dreams real because i’m weak... it doesn’t matter anymore i just want to kill all my ambitions, goals and dreams so i make life easier for myself and everyone around me.

&lt;p&gt;I imagine life would be easier if my wife had married someone else and not me, a failed artist, or if I died so they could move on without needing to support me and my unrealistic dreams and expectations in life, maybe i’m just another failed dreamer that wasn’t tough enough to go all they way or able to sacrifice to make his dreams real because i’m weak... it doesn’t matter anymore i just want to kill all my ambitions, goals and dreams so i make life easier for myself and everyone around me.

I'm now 32 and still not fully out. 
I have had lesbian sex and it's some of the best sex of my life-- if anything I can say I at least had that already! 

I've been abandoned by my family - mother is a malignant narcissist who only cares about image and my enabling coward father and sister wouldn't stand up for me and none of them give a fuck about my human dignity or if I live or die. My mother attempted to eradicate  my soul.

My college best friend who I was in love with is catholic and now engaged to a man. We could never be together in reality but I feel like she used me for emotional closeness and never truly was able to validate my love for her. She told me she loves me but I feel entirely invalidated as a human being by her.

My only hope is that I'm going to be getting onto weight loss drugs soon and am going to get into therapy and start the healing process but I don't think I'll ever fully feel normal again after being discarded by my heartless family and watching the love of my life marry a man and start a life with him. I know our love and the feelings we have towards each other are much more real in comparison to what she has with this average man but I am being eaten alive by the fact he gets to have her and i prob won't see her again for years. He only got her because he has a dick and I don't. If I had been born a man I'd get to be with her forever. Like-- none of it was real yet it was all real to me. Sometimes I don't  think she truly cares if I exist or not. I also think she's a covert narcissst or a sociopath idk. She's the only woman who truly knows me but I haven't started to date women yet who are out of the closet and comfortable in their sexuality. She was my ""pre coming out"" love. I think about her 24/7 and my thoughts have been consumed by her for 5 years. We still message each other every day despite her being engaged to the man. I'm sure she prob liked me but she could never act on the feelings I guess... it's horrible. I want to consume her in every way.

I've put my all into these relationships and received barely anything in return. I've been isolating myself for a while. I don't feel like my existence on this earth matters anymore and it's a very chilling feeling. What's the point anymore. I was everything I could be and it was never enough for anyone!

But the fact animal abuse goes on, and it's basically legal, and there's nothing much I can do about it, cause I know it's not going to change because MOST people are cruel, greedy and selfish.

,SuicideWatch,"Harsh truths. Gentle truths. I need either at this point.

I have suicide plan ideas, no solid plan yet. I want to die. Hanging did not work back when I was 19, so don't wanna try that. OD is extremely difficult to do, I'm more likely to just get hospitalized for that. I do not like gore so don't want to expose that to someone by shooting myself with my step dads gun or jump off a cliff. On my list is either charcoal burning, jumping into a cold lake hoping for hypothermia/cold water drowning, or purposeful heat stroke (I'm a runner; I imagine this would be easy to do just not pleasant to experience). I know the biggest challenge is my body's natural desire to live, unfortunately.

At the same time I don't know if I am actually going to go through with it. Maybe I wrote out the plans as a coping mechanism - to know it is there in case things hit the fan more than they already have, such as my mom dying from cancer/complications of cancer.

I'm on vacation, without any actual plans. I'm just bopping around. Even on vacation I am painfully depressed. This isn't like me, I usually find adventure and fun in the smallest things and find great joy in the spontaneous and I romanticize the shit about everything and anything.

The other night, I could actually feel the emotional pain where I did not want to breathe anymore.

Some background about me: I have depression/anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD. I also have a clinical doctorate and do not dislike my job, but I'm also in 200k+ debt that will be forgiven if I die. I have been feeling quite isolated in the small town I've been in since last fall. My mom got diagnosed with late stage cancer and while she made it through chemo and radiation, she has been having toxic side effects from immunotherapy and recurrent respiratory failure episodes in which she has had 6 hospital admissions in the last month alone. I am not close to my dad or step dad. I feel lonely and I have no close friends. I'm scared of living a life without my mom. Without my aging cat. Without anyone. Life looks bleak. I'm tired of being the funny person and the one that looks out for people, but all alone once I'm at home. Silence is no longer comforting, but neither is music anymore. Nothing soothes the ache.

I do not enjoy what I usually do. I want to force myself to go out and trail run and boulder, things I love but I just do not anymore. I know these are textbook symptoms of depression. I have the logic to identify what is going on, but that does not make me feel better emotionally. I love the moon and sunsets and now when I look at them, I feel nothing. I have no interest in anything in life.

Yes this is a post for ""attention"" because I want to spend the next hour reading advice or insights to keep me distracted, genuinely. I have nothing else going on. I have plans to go through with this on either the 18th or 20th. But I also have a therapy appointment tomorrow too and yes I will let her know, maybe she will admit me. Maybe that's what I need.",t2_d6504icz,False,,0,False,Give me truth.,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e486ph,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,False,,1721082565.0,,[],{},,True,,1721082358.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harsh truths. Gentle truths. I need either at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have suicide plan ideas, no solid plan yet. I want to die. Hanging did not work back when I was 19, so don&amp;#39;t wanna try that. OD is extremely difficult to do, I&amp;#39;m more likely to just get hospitalized for that. I do not like gore so don&amp;#39;t want to expose that to someone by shooting myself with my step dads gun or jump off a cliff. On my list is either charcoal burning, jumping into a cold lake hoping for hypothermia/cold water drowning, or purposeful heat stroke (I&amp;#39;m a runner; I imagine this would be easy to do just not pleasant to experience). I know the biggest challenge is my body&amp;#39;s natural desire to live, unfortunately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time I don&amp;#39;t know if I am actually going to go through with it. Maybe I wrote out the plans as a coping mechanism - to know it is there in case things hit the fan more than they already have, such as my mom dying from cancer/complications of cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m on vacation, without any actual plans. I&amp;#39;m just bopping around. Even on vacation I am painfully depressed. This isn&amp;#39;t like me, I usually find adventure and fun in the smallest things and find great joy in the spontaneous and I romanticize the shit about everything and anything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other night, I could actually feel the emotional pain where I did not want to breathe anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background about me: I have depression/anxiety, PTSD, and ADHD. I also have a clinical doctorate and do not dislike my job, but I&amp;#39;m also in 200k+ debt that will be forgiven if I die. I have been feeling quite isolated in the small town I&amp;#39;ve been in since last fall. My mom got diagnosed with late stage cancer and while she made it through chemo and radiation, she has been having toxic side effects from immunotherapy and recurrent respiratory failure episodes in which she has had 6 hospital admissions in the last month alone. I am not close to my dad or step dad. I feel lonely and I have no close friends. I&amp;#39;m scared of living a life without my mom. Without my aging cat. Without anyone. Life looks bleak. I&amp;#39;m tired of being the funny person and the one that looks out for people, but all alone once I&amp;#39;m at home. Silence is no longer comforting, but neither is music anymore. Nothing soothes the ache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do not enjoy what I usually do. I want to force myself to go out and trail run and boulder, things I love but I just do not anymore. I know these are textbook symptoms of depression. I have the logic to identify what is going on, but that does not make me feel better emotionally. I love the moon and sunsets and now when I look at them, I feel nothing. I have no interest in anything in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes this is a post for &amp;quot;attention&amp;quot; because I want to spend the next hour reading advice or insights to keep me distracted, genuinely. I have nothing else going on. I have plans to go through with this on either the 18th or 20th. But I also have a therapy appointment tomorrow too and yes I will let her know, maybe she will admit me. Maybe that&amp;#39;s what I need.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"i live on a closed and private urbanization of condos, and around 6:40 pm the group chat of the urbanization went crazy. people were asking to help someone and for someone to please call ambulance. that’s when i we (my parents and i) started hearing someone screaming outside.

this was a woman, she was crying hard. she was screaming: “please don’t let this be true”, “somebody please tell me that is a nightmare”, “please tell me that my daughter is well”. all the neighbors were around her trying to help. people called the police and the ambulance, she kept crying and screaming. 

after a few minutes a white car appeared and entered really fast until it came close to the woman screaming. it stopped abruptly and people got out of it. it was family of the girl and her mom.

people approached to the house. 

when the police came, they entered. i was talking to a neighbor who had more context of what was going on. it seems the girl already had some mental health problems. he told me that her mom entered the house but didn’t found her anywhere -the sad thing is, she’s a 27 year old that has a baby of 12 to 18 months i would say- she found the baby on the bed undressed (he’s okay) and the bathroom door locked. she started knocking on it but no answer. that’s when she realized what was going on and started to cry for help.

around that time the neighbor was telling me that, another of the neighbors happened to be a nurse, so when the police came, the nurse, a cop and a familiar of the girl went into the house. one of them went down and told us to please keep calling the ambulance; the girl seemed to don’t have any pulse.

they returned upstairs and a few minutes later the ambulance arrived. they came downstairs and statutes saying that she needed reanimation. minutes after, she regained pulse.

it seems she took pills, we don’t know how much and since how long.

they took her out of the house the ambulance runed away with her. that was at around 7:40 pm. we haven’t heard anything yet. (it’s 10:47 pm we i am)


this is the first time i experience this kind of situation and my head is spinning. hearing the mom screaming, watching her family rushing in, the police, the ambulance coming in and taking her out… but what striked me the most was watching her baby in the arms of her husband and thinking: how could you do that to him? (i don’t mean to judge) i felt so sad for that little boy… as i said she appeared to be alive when they took her away, i hope she is. i hope all the family is okay. i don’t know what she was going through but i hope she recovers and get to see her son and her husband.

if you are having thoughts or if you are in a bad place please seek help, please talk to somebody. there is people out there that loves you, even if you feel that there isn’t i can guarantee you that somewhere out there there is somebody that loves you. things will get worse before they start to get better, so please keep fighting, you’re gonna make it , you’re gonna pull through it, you’re gonna be okay, everything is gonna be okay.

,SuicideWatch,"I feel like I’m constantly doing what I feel like a normal human should be doing. I consume so much social media and watch so much tv that idk what’s real and what’s a performance anymore. What is performative friendship and what’s real anyway? I feel truly like it’s all a performance like I genuinely feel like a character in a show trying to keep everyone entertained. I know I should have friends and a partner and I should keep trying to be presentable but everything just feels like this huge chore and I’m constantly trying to pretend it isn’t. I think art and life is one and the same because some people find joy in the act while for others the artificial nature of it makes it unenjoyable. I don’t have fun pretending people’s up and down behavior is amusing and generally people are more aggravating than anything. I find people exhausting because of how unpredictable they are. I can’t just be me because of course I get what it’s like on the receiving end and for that reason alone I must be kind.

I must constantly set aside my own needs and respond to people even though I find it utterly boring. I think to have any sort of amusement in life you have to be somewhat selfish. The happiest people I met were complete assholes who put themselves above everything. An ex friend of mine would never consider suicide and had so much love for life she couldn’t have it in her to have empathy for someone who doesn’t. It must be easy for someone like her who forgives and forgets so easily and steps all over the things I enjoy. She showed little interest in what I enjoyed and had the nerve to say that I HAD THE POWER in the friendship. 

I had the power yet I constantly bent myself backwards trying to be a good friend showing interest in what she liked yet she treated me like a complete ghost and I was just another person for her to collect. This is how optimistic people are, they think miserable people are a burden and the mere presence of unhappiness is a threat on their wellbeing. Me just being my true authentic self is a threat on people and they feel uncomfortable. They think I’m stupid for caring about the wellness of human beings and society. They think I’m weak for watching the news and being personally emotionally affected by things. Feeling sadness at the plight of others is seen as a weakness. I genuinely can’t live in a world where everyone is trying to get ahead by acting on their own selfish needs.

True empathy is extremely hard to come by and people who seemed like they had good intentions hurt me. They still act on their selfish desires and don’t care whether it’s what’s good or not. It’s like every waking moment I’m questioning everything I consume. The idea of being rich is enticing until I see how every rich person is out of touch to a certain degree. They try to be good people yet they participate in the exact thing that makes people hurt. You can’t exactly bend yourself for other’s needs but at the same time these people should quit pretending to be altruistic when in actuality they’re apart of the same competitive system as the rest of us. 

A true selfless act would be not participating in most things. It seems like no matter what I do I’m inadvertently hurting someone. I think I should just take the burden away from everyone by ending it all. Being human is being selfish inherently. We can say we want a change as much as we want and it does seem like humanity swings towards goodness.

I consume so much social media and watch so much tv that idk what’s real and what’s a performance anymore. What is performative friendship and what’s real anyway? I feel truly like it’s all a performance like I genuinely feel like a character in a show trying to keep everyone entertained. I know I should have friends and a partner and I should keep trying to be presentable but everything just feels like this huge chore and I’m constantly trying to pretend it isn’t. I think art and life is one and the same because some people find joy in the act while for others the artificial nature of it makes it unenjoyable. I don’t have fun pretending people’s up and down behavior is amusing and generally people are more aggravating than anything. I find people exhausting because of how unpredictable they are. I can’t just be me because of course I get what it’s like on the receiving end and for that reason alone I must be kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must constantly set aside my own needs and respond to people even though I find it utterly boring. I think to have any sort of amusement in life you have to be somewhat selfish.

,SuicideWatch,"I've pretty much gone through everything at this point.

I've (unsuccessfully) gone through training via an outpatient program to learn DBT skills, I've restarted my ADHD meds (which help with my impulsive behavior, but not nearly enough), I've been seeing a therapist for about half a year now to no real effect, and I've continued to spiral, withdraw, self-harm, and drag everyone around me through completely insane emotional outbursts.

I don't feel self-righteous or justified in any way afterwards, though, the way people seem to talk about it. I feel exhausted and deeply embarrassed, because looking back, I can see how completely irrational I was being to the point that my own behavior doesn't seem to make sense at all. It just makes me want to crawl into a hole and disappear, because how the fuck could anyone tolerate that more than once? What makes a person like that worth the effort?

Everyone around me is trying their hardest, but my outbursts and meltdowns are constant, sometimes more than once a week, and none of the grounding techniques I learned in outpatient work very well.

I feel like a burden, persistently.

When I try to look up advice, information, or self-help, I'm just bombarded with horror stories about people's abusive relationships at the hand of someone with BPD, that people like me should simply be abandoned, how I'm doomed to suffer for the rest of my life, how I'll never be happy with anything and I simply cannot be fixed.

My therapist and my current psychiatrist tell me that what I have is actually CPTSD, and that BPD isn't a ""real"" diagnosis, and yet it's right there on my psych eval from my last psychiatrist, permanently affixed to my mental health record, and even they tell me that it's not something that'll ever be fixed, that I just have to learn to cope and manage it.

I'm sitting in a voice call right now feeling irritated by everyone speaking, wanting to lash out irrationally, but even if I leave it'll set people off, and that if I leave, I'm going to progressively cut myself off until someone comes to retrieve me. I can fucking hear it already, ""There she goes again, she's doing it again,"" I can hear the sighs and the exasperation, I can feel my best friend's blood pressure rising.

I just can't stand this anymore. I'm not happy. I'm never happy. I feel like a fucking curse on everyone in my life and I care too much about them to keep subjecting them to this bullshit. I can't even make new friends, I just drive them off or else they abandon me or lose interest, which is fair, given I'm not very interesting, so it's like there's just this slow trickle of everyone away from me, like I'm bleeding out, and I can't stand this persistent feeling of isolation and misery anymore.",t2_gg4o9o77,False,,0,False,I was diagnosed with BPD this year.

,SuicideWatch,"I am a software developer and like many of us I got laid off 4 months ago. To explain my story from the top college was a depressing time for me, I did whatever I could to graduate without debt, the community college route, stayed home all 4 years but shit went sideways with a transfer to the college at the 2 year mark of my journey I wanted not working out and it led to a suicide attempt which landed me in the hospital, at my parents insistence even though I wanted time to rest, they wanted me to apply wherever I can and get going with a transfer to graduate within the normal 4 year timeframe. I didn't have a choice so within a day I got back from the hospital I started applying and got into a school, so I did, still made the call to stay home to save money due to the pandemic. I still really had a tough time working through my mental shit with therapy and balancing that with school, I barely scraped by with my grades, my professors there as a silver lining had connections to an extremely prestigious institution for computer science which I ended up getting an internship through that and working with them. I barely had a social life unless friends came back from their college. Despite everything, inevitably I graduated in 2022 within the 4 years without debt like my parents wanted and I got a 3 job offers from reputable companies within 3 months of searching.

When I accepted the job out of the 3, I was finally happy, it was fully remote, great benefits, and solid WLB. I was off to a strong start, and it felt great. I got along with my coworkers and managers. I moved out and lived on my own on the first time, could buy all the stuff that I wanted. I thought for the first time I made it, and I could start living my life. I got showered praise from manager for around 7-8 months, and he reassured that I am doing great. My director after I met him in person for my first business trip really liked me and even offered me to help him with a project he was overseeing from the ground up for the company. He even messaged me personally that I was getting a substantial raise without me even asking which was based on performance. A couple weeks later I got the raise however, there was another lead person I answered to on the technical side of the main stack I worked on and unfortunately with it being my first job I was still learning the ropes and I was beyond the 6-month mark (8 months) and during the code review I asked an extremely stupid coding question which I am embarrassed to repeat. He didn't say anything to me that meeting, and when I had my 1-1 with my direct report a couple days later, I was told by him that my tech lead said ""he doubted my competency to do my job"" with a meeting that included all the managers, tech leads, and director. So eventually it became this cycle of him complaining to my direct report/management first, so it was always a 2v1 against me and my direct conversation with him happened after the fact. In between this my direct manager said everything was going fine and even got constant praise from my director, I tried my best to improve wherever I can but it made things confusing on how I was doing. Eventually we had this meeting before Christmas where all the teams got together within our division and the leads of each stack talked about, we did. The tech lead proceeded to credit everyone in the summit for their specific contributions in the stack and left me out, not even crediting for helping out with a project someone else was working on which he brought up.

That led into my next meeting where due to circumstances my original direct report had have an extended leave transferred his responsibilities to a different manager and proceeded to put me on a PiP and my tech lead would be involved. My manager was put on one before and said I can get through it. At this point I wanted to keep my job because of the market and despite everything that happened I wanted to stay here and have a long-term career. Long story short it was grueling, day in day out I had to attend every meeting in our division, work long hours, constantly felt like my tech lead made jabs at me during code reviews in front of everyone even once telling me in front of my entire team when I built a design document which said he was right at a high level when I asked him in a dm the day before, then in the code review telling me it was wrong and told me that ""I was just guessing"" in front of everyone.

Eventually the dreaded message came to meet my director for a 1-1 in a Teams meeting a couple weeks before my PiP ended, and I got the news I was laid off with a bunch of other employees. It was probably due to what happened with my performance review last year and despite that in the meeting my director said he can be a reference and he got everyone else he could on the team to give me assistance with finding a new job through endorsements and recommendations. Didn't get a single message from my original direct report and the last message I got from my tech lead as the team immediately received the news of the layoff was a notification that he removed me from the code review teams meetings despite my corporate account being deleted within the hour.

I am now 3 months in the job search, and I haven't landed a single interview from any application I submitted. I am getting to the point now where I have to force myself to apply my jobs and applying to less and less each day. Despite tuning my LinkedIn, getting recommendations from several colleagues ranging from my director, other tech leads, managers and developers who liked me at my last job and getting my resume reviewed by multiple people even an ex-FAANG recruiter who said it's in a good spot. Tried everything from tuning my resume for each position, changing the format, unique cover letters, to even shotgunning applications nothing I send is sticking. I have 3 months of unemployment left and another year of savings after that so I can last till my apartment lease ends. But now I am getting pressured by my parents to take the first offer since I have only gotten interviews from recruiters calling me for bottom of the barrel contract jobs. I know they are probably right but I just don't know how I will have the energy to job search when managing another job.

I am starting to give up on life and just wondering what the point of it all is. The job was the only thing I had in college that proved everything I did and sacrificed was worth it; I am close to my mid 20's I realized I missed out on huge amount of social opportunities and long-lasting friends or relationships in college and I am not unemployed which makes it even worse. I still have friend groups in my childhood I am still very close with but it's hard to feel everyone is passing you by while you struggle and get lectured on what to do. I just feel an extreme amount of jealousy towards everyone I know since they have their jobs still and are advancing professionally and socially and seeing many of my old colleagues getting promotions on LinkedIn. Recently, I sometimes feel that I should have ended my life that day in 2020 because I feel like either way, I fail one way or the other, I have been seeing a therapist and while it has been helping idk if it's enough.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm 22(M), and I'm in my final year in some university in Nigeria. Recently, I've been having some thoughts of ending my life. It's crazy, because this is the first time I'm saying this out loud lol. I guess I have never said it out loud because I wish it wasn't true, plus I think the reason why I'm having these thoughts is pretty much stupid in the grand scheme of things. It may sound dumb, but the reason I've been having these thoughts is because I may end up not graduating this year, and my energy for school is nonexistent. I never really liked school from day one. And I live in a society that bases your worth majorly on your academic achievements and then financial status. The moment I stepped into this university, I have been dreaming about leaving or dropping out. I study Engineering, and the programme typically spans 5 years, and I always thought that before the 5 years would be up, I'd hit jackpot in my career as a frontend developer and drop out.
I think the major reason why not graduating this year and having an extra year is such a big deal is because of the pressures I experience. Growing up, I had always been the intelligent one and people tend to have high expectations of me because they regard me as intelligent, and those expectations typically involves doing well in the university. But, I just... can't. I hate this school. I don't like being around these people. Every morning I wake up here, it always feels like I'm being strangled. I hate going to classes, I hate writing exams, I hate all of it. And I've never been open about this because I'm afraid of judgement.  Heck, even as I type this I'm judging myself. But feeling this way about school, and then having to stay an extra year?! It feels impossible. I don't think I can do it. And then opening up to my parents and siblings about my academic failures feels like a hurdle that I cannot possibly cross. Especially my parents. Their expectations of me are too high, and they care about me a lot, and I would hate to disappoint them. My parents are not the progressive sort at all. I know for a fact that they won't take it well. They definitely won't. And I'd hate to make them sad, but I can't avoid it at this point. Everything just feels overwhelming right now.

Warning: this post includes loads of triggers, please don’t read if it’ll hurt you. 
I apologise in advance; it’s quite long I thought I should provide context.!

So I (27F), just been told I’m the toxic one in my family. My little brother (19M) got tired of my shit and called me on it. I didn’t know. It was 3h ago, I’m having a breakdown/existential crisis/ realisation overload. 
It’s horrible. I don’t know what to do with myself. I called the suicide helpline. 
For a bit of context: I have several chronic illnesses, all of them quite painful, for the past 7 years. Monthly trips to the A&amp;E, daily hormones/painkillers/antidepressants, weekly appointments to Specialists Dr. It’s quite hard because I tried going to University and had to stop because of the pain, tried working and pain stopped me again , I can’t even be a reliable volunteer. I used to play the cello, and do ballet, and paint and draw, and read a lot, but the pain shakes and the medication makes it too hard now ( kids’Paint by number are too hard for me). 
On top of those chronic illnesses; I have to battle PTSD for multiple rapes, a psychologically abusive ex, medical malpractices, absent father, school bullying ( from preK to A levels), being sterile and daily pain. 
Not a surprise if I tell you I am depressed. 
And I thought the best thing to do was to just deal with all of that myself, to prove them I was independent and strong. Not to burden them because they already had their problems to deal with. 
But no. My brother in law gifted my sister a “how to deal with narcissists” book and I just realised it was about me. 
I had to move in with my mom ( parents going through a separation right now), because I wasn’t able to take care of myself on a daily basis (like food and showers and cleaning and groceries ect were too much). 
And I’ve been treating her like shit. I would be on the streets without her. 
And I thought I had the behaviour that conveyed my gratitude. That’s the worse part, it wasn’t on purpose. The pain gave me tunnel vision and I was so focused on one meal at a time, one step at a time.
They know me so badly they gifted me shelves for my birthday, and did party food ( crisps and mini toasts), because they don’t know my favourite foods. 
I thought I was masking my daily bad moods ( very hard to be happy when your one and unique thought is PAIN), but they were suffering. 
I treated my mum like a slave, I didn’t even say good mornings or thanks to all the chores she did for me. 
I knew I did something bad because she’s been retreating herself from me, leaving me to deal alone with my mess. 
3 days ago I had a flare up so bad I was immobilised and crying /yelling in pain for several hours. The neighbours got worried and called the cops and ambulance. They took me to the hospital and kept me for 3days to ran tests and control the pain. Apparently they came ( mum and brother)to my room and knocked to check up on me and I didn’t hear them. Now, my mum is angry at me because she was ashamed of having to deal with the cops.
A part of me is tired to be made the bad guy every time. If I go to my room to deal with my pain ( like at Christmas), I’m sulking and ignoring everyone. My mum says « to not check for non intentional consequences/ accidents of your actions, is doing it on purpose », basically if you cared you would have thought ahead if it would hurt anyone. So for her, all my hurting behaviour is on purpose. 
They always jump to the worst conclusion; I’m not in terrible pain for days; I’m just being moody and not replying to their texts. 
They don’t understand that I have nothing happening in my life for the past years except my illnesses. I can’t out and I’m losing a lot of my friends ( not on bad terms but it hurts to reply to every “how are you?” With “bad”). 
And I love my family so much, they’re the most important persons to me, the closests. But I just learnt that it was only one way. I was close to them but they didn’t know me. 
You know what the worse is? I don’t remember all that bad behaviour, I zone out/dissociate a lot. Apparently I yell; I don’t remember ever having an argument with my little brother but he just told me it happened several times last summer. I was very mean with all of them, yelled at them and said horrible things ( again I don’t remember).  So they cut me off for several months, September to Christmas. Then I did something wrong for my sister’s birthday apparently and was cut off again in February. My mother only invited me to live with her because she had to pay my rent ( moved in with her end of April). They stopped telling me when they cut me off because apparently I don’t change. 
So my question to you all; I want to explain to them that it’s the depression and ask them to give me another chance ( I’m getting myself into a psychiatric hospital by the end of the week). But a big part of me don’t want to hurt them, to guilt them into forgiveness. I realised how much pain and hurt I caused, and it would be so much better for them if I got out of their life. 
It’s so hard to keep on living every day when you are in non stop pain ( it will be for life, there is no cure, but it won’t kill me so not a Medical research’s priority). I am useless, I can’t provide anything to society, I can’t work, I can’t have kids, I will be someone’s burden all my life. I am suicidal, but the only thing that kept me going was them. I couldn’t do it because it would hurt them. But I already hurt them alive, how much worse can dying really be ? Im seriously thinking of going to Switzerland for the assisted suicide charities, I don’t want one of them to find me dead and traumatise/hurt them even dead.

Monthly trips to the A&amp;amp;E, daily hormones/painkillers/antidepressants, weekly appointments to Specialists Dr. It’s quite hard because I tried going to University and had to stop because of the pain, tried working and pain stopped me again , I can’t even be a reliable volunteer. I used to play the cello, and do ballet, and paint and draw, and read a lot, but the pain shakes and the medication makes it too hard now ( kids’Paint by number are too hard for me). 
On top of those chronic illnesses; I have to battle PTSD for multiple rapes, a psychologically abusive ex, medical malpractices, absent father, school bullying ( from preK to A levels), being sterile and daily pain. 
Not a surprise if I tell you I am depressed. 
And I thought the best thing to do was to just deal with all of that myself, to prove them I was independent and strong. Not to burden them because they already had their problems to deal with. 
But no. My brother in law gifted my sister a “how to deal with narcissists” book and I just realised it was about me. 
I had to move in with my mom ( parents going through a separation right now), because I wasn’t able to take care of myself on a daily basis (like food and showers and cleaning and groceries ect were too much). 
And I’ve been treating her like shit. I would be on the streets without her. 
And I thought I had the behaviour that conveyed my gratitude. That’s the worse part, it wasn’t on purpose. The pain gave me tunnel vision and I was so focused on one meal at a time, one step at a time.
They know me so badly they gifted me shelves for my birthday, and did party food ( crisps and mini toasts), because they don’t know my favourite foods. 
I thought I was masking my daily bad moods ( very hard to be happy when your one and unique thought is PAIN), but they were suffering. 
I treated my mum like a slave, I didn’t even say good mornings or thanks to all the chores she did for me. 
I knew I did something bad because she’s been retreating herself from me, leaving me to deal alone with my mess. 
3 days ago I had a flare up so bad I was immobilised and crying /yelling in pain for several hours. The neighbours got worried and called the cops and ambulance. They took me to the hospital and kept me for 3days to ran tests and control the pain. Apparently they came ( mum and brother)to my room and knocked to check up on me and I didn’t hear them. Now, my mum is angry at me because she was ashamed of having to deal with the cops.
A part of me is tired to be made the bad guy every time. If I go to my room to deal with my pain ( like at Christmas), I’m sulking and ignoring everyone. My mum says « to not check for non intentional consequences/ accidents of your actions, is doing it on purpose », basically if you cared you would have thought ahead if it would hurt anyone. So for her, all my hurting behaviour is on purpose. 
They always jump to the worst conclusion; I’m not in terrible pain for days; I’m just being moody and not replying to their texts. 
They don’t understand that I have nothing happening in my life for the past years except my illnesses. I can’t out and I’m losing a lot of my friends ( not on bad terms but it hurts to reply to every “how are you?” With “bad”). 
And I love my family so much, they’re the most important persons to me, the closests. But I just learnt that it was only one way. I was close to them but they didn’t know me. 
You know what the worse is? I don’t remember all that bad behaviour, I zone out/dissociate a lot. Apparently I yell; I don’t remember ever having an argument with my little brother but he just told me it happened several times last summer. I was very mean with all of them, yelled at them and said horrible things ( again I don’t remember).  So they cut me off for several months, September to Christmas. Then I did something wrong for my sister’s birthday apparently and was cut off again in February. My mother only invited me to live with her because she had to pay my rent ( moved in with her end of April). They stopped telling me when they cut me off because apparently I don’t change. 
So my question to you all; I want to explain to them that it’s the depression and ask them to give me another chance ( I’m getting myself into a psychiatric hospital by the end of the week). But a big part of me don’t want to hurt them, to guilt them into forgiveness. I realised how much pain and hurt I caused, and it would be so much better for them if I got out of their life. 
It’s so hard to keep on living every day when you are in non stop pain ( it will be for life, there is no cure, but it won’t kill me so not a Medical research’s priority). I am useless, I can’t provide anything to society, I can’t work, I can’t have kids, I will be someone’s burden all my life. I am suicidal, but the only thing that kept me going was them. I couldn’t do it because it would hurt them. But I already hurt them alive, how much worse can dying really be ? Im seriously thinking of going to Switzerland for the assisted suicide charities, I don’t want one of them to find me dead and traumatise/hurt them even dead. 
Opened to all suggestions and advice and help, 
Thank you in advance for reading all this. &lt;/p&gt;

Recently I felt really down, suicidal, I told her I couldnt handle being in the same room as her and I stepped out to lay down by myself to collect my thoughts. After a while I realized the state that I was in I couldn’t stop thinking that way and I just wanted to cry alone and doze off. I let her know I would do this and she said it was okay with a sad face emoji. I knew this meant she wasn’t okay with it and she stopped responding to me all together. She tells me to be the bigger person in the relationship and at that moment all I could think about was how to make her feel better. I quickly got myself together for her sake and came back, she kept telling me why I came back and I told her it was because I was worried for her. Eventually she asked me why, I told her I was feeling suicidal again. She didn’t say anything to comfort me, or atleast I didn’t feel comforted. Then she went on to tell me how I made her mad and how I make her feel worthless because I don’t do enough for her. I just feel so unseen and honestly writing all this out makes me feel so selfish. 

My suicidal tendencies aren’t because of her or this, this definitely feeds onto it though. 

Just now she called me asking me where I put something she bought as a gift, I told her I didn’t know and after her searching everywhere she believes I left it in her old house. I told her to contact someone there to be given the chance to find it but she completely shuts me down. I offer to do it for her and she says it’s useless.

,SuicideWatch,"I feel like this is probably just as much a release and hopefully helps me let out a lot of tension I have inside me. 

I have a history of suicide, I tried when I was 14 and failed (which is quite ironic because I was doing it because I felt like a failure). I’m 26 now and the feelings have got stronger and stronger day by day. 

It’s hard to explain because on paper I’m very fortunate. I’ve got a good job, I’ve got mostly a good lifestyle and I live one of the best cities in the world. Butttt.. I hate myself, I hate everything about myself outside of the situation I’m in. 

I hate my skin colour, it makes me feel like an outsider in my own country, with my own friends. I’ve been brought up in a society that I believe thinks being white is better and that’s more so drilled into me and my thinking. So many people saying oh you aren’t British, no no where are you really from. 

My dad left my family when I was young. Which I think is pretty common but it’s the lack of effort he tried with me. His only communications with me, if we can even classify it as that, was to goad my mother. 

My last girlfriend told me she doesn’t love me and felt like she never could. That shit cut me so deep, I felt unlovable and even when asking to explain it she said she didn’t know, but I was so nice she wanted to try.

My mum has always put the pressure on me to perform and whilst that has meant I’ve achieved a lot of academic success. I will always look for the negative in myself or the situation because that’s how it’s always been for me. My mum would always point out my weak points to prove.

I&amp;#39;m exhausted all the time because I put so much into this stupid job and I don&amp;#39;t have time for myself to rest or care for myself the way I need. I&amp;#39;m just the worst person alive is all I&amp;#39;ve learned and I just want to kill myself and be done with it. &lt;/p&gt;

But I&amp;#39;m so tired of being alive and trying my hardest only to have it thrown back in my face with accusations that I don&amp;#39;t care. This is stupid. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"TW for suicide (duh) and self-harm.

Frankly, I don't want to die at this moment. Disappearing sounds amazing, but me comitting suicide would make my mom very sad and I don't want to put her through that. 

It's really weird and stupid, but for years and years I've just had intense fantasies of getting really hurt and being hospitalized. I have no idea why, as I know this wouldn't fix anything, and probably just make me feel worse. But Gods, I just want someone to actively care for me and see how miserable I am.

Yesterday evening I told myself, tomorrow would be the day. This morning I was supposed to slit my wrists. Not sure what the plan was after that. Either call the emergency number myself or have my mom help. 

Well, I did it, kinda. Not enough to seriously hurt me though. 

I just can't get it out of my head, and everyday I'm in a constant debate whether I should do it or not. 

What I absolutely do not want though, is to get the rest of my family involved in this, and Gods those social workers. No offense, they're just doing their jobs, but I seriously cannot deal with those people anymore and I can already imagine the conversations. Also a mental hospital sounds absolutely miserable. 

Then, make it look like an accident? Be hit by a car? I frequently go out, it wouldn't be strange for me to wound up in an accident at all. But that'd hurt damn bad, and the chance of me dying would be bigger.

These thoughts are horrible and I've had them for so long, but never have I been so close to actually following them as I am now. I just *cannot* live like this anymore. I am so goddamn miserable everyday and no one can do anything about it.

So much therapy, so much different medication, so much ""how does that make you feel?"", so much being forced to look into my future when I don't see anything there, and *none* of it has helped in the slighest. I'm done, I need a break. 

I can't talk about this with my mom, it'd make her so concerned and she already has too much stuff going on, in general I just cannot seem to talk about anything like this face to face with someone, and I'd be scared a therapist would put me in a mental hospital.

,SuicideWatch,"
Im 17f, and a military brat to start this off. Ever since I was a little kid, I’ve dealt with major rage issues, I’ve slammed and broken iPads, computers, household items, punched walls, etc you get the point. This, mixed with a dad with PTSD (and probably bipolar) and a sister with audhd made home hell. It felt like constantly walking on eggshells.

For a while in my life, the mix of my dad being a chronic asshole and my mom just trying to enjoy her life lead to lots of fighting. A lot. There were months where there would be screaming matches every day between parents, where computer mice were being thrown through walls from across the house (impressive throw though) or smaller things broken. This usually ended with a “we’re getting a divorce” (spoiler, it never happened), being threatened hundreds of times. Whenever I talked to my sister, it turned into a game of rules, what can I say not to peeve her, what can I listen to on my phone, what can I do in her presence to not bother her, which a lot of times ended up happening anyways. When we were kids, whenever we argued we were told to just shut up, and we’ve grown up hearing yelling, so when we disagree nowadays we do just that. It turns into a game of who can hurt the other more. This makes my relationship with her very rocky, we’ll go from pissed to happy to pissed again, to once again happy within the same day, every day.

When I was a kid, things started popping up early, me scratching myself at 6-7, moving onto poking myself with needles when I was 8-9. This only got worse as I went to blades. My parents swear it’s a teenage thing, but because of the ages mentioned I don’t think it is. I’ve always felt this way. A mix of how easily I flip out now, and how I treat myself and others, my family sometimes treats me like I’m just crazy, which pisses me off more and makes me start insulting them. I know part of it is pent up anger, but I’m starting to think they’re right. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.

I cannot get myself to get up and go to school anymore, I’ll miss 70+ days a year even though my school is only half the average school day. 4 hours. I cannot handle 4 hours of school. In turn, my dad yells. I cannot keep friends, I go through a phase where I’m obsessed with one friend, then I ghost everyone else and sometimes even said friend I’m fixated on in the moment, simply as a “do they care”, and even if they do message me I continue doing so. This makes friendships hard, I’m constantly finding a new friend every few months, even though I have others messaging me asking to hang out. I scream at my family, I ghost my friends, I cannot keep my room cleaned to save my life, ive been pushing for a psychiatrist for years because of my doctor suggesting potential adhd, and a mix of my parents not wanting to accept both of their children can have issues and psychiatrists full on ignoring us because the area we live in is godawful when it comes to mental health is making it impossible. I’ve tried anti depressants, and it hasn’t worked much, and I don’t benefit those around me. 

As a kid I was an edgelord, and I still am I guess, when I was 7-8 I watched gore, I won’t say the website but it was a very well known site. It was a mix of morbid curiosity and outlet, maybe I was partly trying to understand my dad at the time with his combat related ptsd, why he was so mean. I used to flex this to my friends, describe all the gnarly details as if it was something to show off, then I’d go home and watch that same thing. I know now how cringey that was. The issue is is that habit stuck, I still find myself visiting those sites, and doing mass research into any crime that sounded interesting to read. I know it’s cringey. Although, suicide videos always stuck out to me since I was a kid, it always being an escape in the back of my mind because of it.

Now I’m here, I just got done being left on hold for over an hour while trying to get ahold of a psychiatrist again, I’ve been hospitalized for attempts before, you’d think they’d care more but it’s been years of this. Years of being given referrals to clinics that don’t take my families insurance or just flat out ignore us. There is nothing I can do anymore. I feel so done with it all. No one’s taking new patients. I’m sick of screaming at my family, I’m sick of making my friends feel like shit because I can’t message back, I’m sick of feeling my heart get torn in two every time I get a message telling me that a friend is done with me, and I’m sick of being forced through these overwhelmingly strong emotions with nothing helping.

This is probably very poorly written but I do not care, i feel like a broken record and I don’t think I want to continue ts. I cannot believe how much the mental health system has failed me, I tried getting help, and got ignored. They couldn’t care less about me and I’m done giving a shit in a life where no one else does

CW: Possible pedophilia 

I just remembered something that happened when I was about 13 years old and it’s stressing me out. I think I walked in on my little sister (who would’ve been about 11 at the time) masturbating to a picture of out step - nephew who would’ve been a toddler then. Or I just saw the photo of him on my sister’s phone, there was no nudity in the pic or anything explicitly sexual, it just looked like my sister found a regular photo of him and zoomed in on his butt and screenshotted it. I don’t really remember this and I don’t know for sure if it was him but I do remember finding other pictures on her phone of similar things that she found on google but they were adults. I told her and our youngest brother about these other photos and she said she just thought they were funny or something (I think) and I thought it was funny too. But I sometimes sort of remember walking in on her masturbating to one of the photos but I honestly can’t remember any of this clearly and it’s stressing me out so much. 

I’m 17 and she’s 16 now and she’s never really expressed attraction to children, she did say sort of recently that Sheldon from young Sheldon was cute but not in like a weird way. But what if she did actually have a picture of our step - nephew and she had it for sexual reasons? What am I supposed to do? I remember worrying about this a little while back but I stopped for some reason, I think I stopped worrying about it because I couldn’t remember how old the child looked in the picture and thought it was someone close to her age at the time (which it still might be because I can’t remember). If that did actually happen, I don’t think I could bring myself to tell my mom and I don’t know if she’d actually do something about it anyway. I’ve told her that me and my sibling are likely struggling with mental health issues before and she just ignored it.

A few years ago I tried Wellbutrin, and it did absolutely nothing for me. I've moved on to Sertraline and Strattera. It's probably just the Strattera, but it destroyed my entire personality. I just stopped taking them a few weeks ago. Yeah, I know I needed to fucking taper them. I just couldn't stand feeling like a robot anymore.

I've talked to therapists and psychiatrists, but I lie to them about how bad things are. I've heard them sound disappointed when I tell them that I'm ""passively suicidal"". I cant tell them the truth. I don't see how institutionalizing me is going to make my life any better. I'll lose my job, then without a job, the bank will foreclose on my house. I'll jump off a fucking building if that happens.  
  
A few weeks ago, for the first time, I mentioned how I was feeling to my friend. You know what I was met with? Dismissal and judgement. 15 years of my god damned life spent building a friendship with her and she cant even be fucked to carry on a text conversation. The amount of hours I've talked about and remained actively engaged in her life, but she can't even conjure up two texts. I'm sure that once she decides to start talking to me again and when she pretends that I never said anything, I'll forgive her. It's because I'm a spineless piece of shit.

I pour everything I have into other people. No one pours anything back into me. No one has ever empathized with me. It doesn't matter the situation or circumstance, everything is always my fault. I'm a utility pole and once I'm out of utility to give, everyone will abandon me. Perhaps it's for the best. It will make ending things a whole lot easier. No one will miss me and it'll be easier knowing all vestiges of hope are gone.

,SuicideWatch,"I have other reddit accounts but need to post this under this account because quite frankly the name fits how I feel. This is long, but context, I wrote this right now after the thoughts and actions of last night.

Looking back, I think I was having a mental health crisis last night. For some reason, at dinner, I felt a wash of calmness come over me about my life. This calmness is **not** the type of calmness someone should have. 

I thought “maybe if I just go to sleep, the thoughts won’t be as prevalent”. Then I woke up in the middle of the night with these thoughts in my head the loudest they’ve ever been. Then I bargained with myself “If you write them down, then they are real, and you need help. If you don’t write them down; you’ll be ok.” Finally, the voice was so loud I had no choice. I started to write from 4-7AM I was research and preparing.

When my sister died, we had a terrible time finding all her accounts and contacting her friends. 

Last night I took multiple steps in preparation.

·      Made a sheet with all my important account logins (with instructions on specific logins to make sure they don’t cancel things like my cell phone before all those are completed)

·      Located the deed to the house (at least I think it’s the deed)

·      Turned off things like two factor authentication on accounts wherever possible and FaceID

·      Confirmed the beneficiaries of my employer life insurance policies? (Did you know that some policies through your employer only allow you to change your beneficiaries during either a life event or open enrollment?)

·      Tried to confirm if self-extermination would still pay out the above (in general policies apparently do after 2-3 years of being written – always check your specific policy though)

·      What contact they should let know that I self-committed.

In addition to the above, I even started to do one of those online wills. But then I realized the following.

·      I need two people to sign my will. Who could I get to sign this without setting off alarm bells.

·      Would my last will and testament even be valid when it was created in crisis?

Then finally I started writing a letter to my mom. It wasn’t a letter explaining why I did the irreversible; but why I felt this way and how I promised her if I ever felt this way, I would seek emergency help. Then I questioned myself, ""Am I really at that point""?

I then decided to find a better definition of what it means to be in a mental health crisis. Does thinking about self-extermination make a crisis? If so, I’ve been in one for years with varying intensity. Does preparing for the logistics of post expiration make a crisis? We all know that if someone attempts self-extermination they are in crisis. But what about before that? How do you recognize that you, yourself, in that moment, are in crisis and need help but don't have a fully thought out plan?

By this time, it was about 7AM. I decided that I am unable to work today and e-mailed my boss such. I almost slept on the floor of my bathroom because it is the only room that I could make completely dark to match how I felt. However, I did not go that far. I just kept the ac at the temp I normally sleep in and cocooned myself in my blanket in a tightness I have never done before and slept.

I am telling myself I am writing this because I am unsure I need help, and I think I may have to go at least on a 72-hour hold, but because for me 

·      I am unsure I was or even still am in crisis

·      I bargained with myself that if they I can push a little harder and wait a little while longer; the feelings will go away, and then can try and just get through life.

The feelings aren’t going away, they may become subdued; but they do flare back. Even in this moment, as I close out this, I still wonder if I am crisis and need to seek emergency help. The scary thing is what they will do to me, and how at that point, I will truly feel like I have failed at life.

Maybe I’ll stop barging with myself and go; maybe I won’t and just try and push it down again, hoping it doesn’t come back worse because; today…I fear by doing what I did above; I have made it 1000% times easier for me to go even further the next time these thoughts come around.",t2_14m0mc9aa3,False,,0,False,Am I in Crisis?,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e43873,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1721070533.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have other reddit accounts but need to post this under this account because quite frankly the name fits how I feel. This is long, but context, I wrote this right now after the thoughts and actions of last night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back, I think I was having a mental health crisis last night. For some reason, at dinner, I felt a wash of calmness come over me about my life. This calmness is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; the type of calmness someone should have. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought “maybe if I just go to sleep, the thoughts won’t be as prevalent”. Then I woke up in the middle of the night with these thoughts in my head the loudest they’ve ever been. Then I bargained with myself “If you write them down, then they are real, and you need help. If you don’t write them down; you’ll be ok.” Finally, the voice was so loud I had no choice. I started to write from 4-7AM I was research and preparing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my sister died, we had a terrible time finding all her accounts and contacting her friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last night I took multiple steps in preparation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      Made a sheet with all my important account logins (with instructions on specific logins to make sure they don’t cancel things like my cell phone before all those are completed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      Located the deed to the house (at least I think it’s the deed)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      Turned off things like two factor authentication on accounts wherever possible and FaceID&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      Confirmed the beneficiaries of my employer life insurance policies? (Did you know that some policies through your employer only allow you to change your beneficiaries during either a life event or open enrollment?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      Tried to confirm if self-extermination would still pay out the above (in general policies apparently do after 2-3 years of being written – always check your specific policy though)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      What contact they should let know that I self-committed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, I even started to do one of those online wills. But then I realized the following.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      I need two people to sign my will. Who could I get to sign this without setting off alarm bells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      Would my last will and testament even be valid when it was created in crisis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then finally I started writing a letter to my mom. It wasn’t a letter explaining why I did the irreversible; but why I felt this way and how I promised her if I ever felt this way, I would seek emergency help. Then I questioned myself, &amp;quot;Am I really at that point&amp;quot;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then decided to find a better definition of what it means to be in a mental health crisis. Does thinking about self-extermination make a crisis? If so, I’ve been in one for years with varying intensity. Does preparing for the logistics of post expiration make a crisis? We all know that if someone attempts self-extermination they are in crisis. But what about before that? How do you recognize that you, yourself, in that moment, are in crisis and need help but don&amp;#39;t have a fully thought out plan?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time, it was about 7AM. I decided that I am unable to work today and e-mailed my boss such. I almost slept on the floor of my bathroom because it is the only room that I could make completely dark to match how I felt. However, I did not go that far. I just kept the ac at the temp I normally sleep in and cocooned myself in my blanket in a tightness I have never done before and slept. If I woke up, I would just lay in my cocoon till I would fall asleep again. I kept doing this till now, 1500 US eastern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am telling myself I am writing this because I am unsure I need help, and I think I may have to go at least on a 72-hour hold, but because for me &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      I am unsure I was or even still am in crisis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;·      I bargained with myself that if they I can push a little harder and wait a little while longer; the feelings will go away, and then can try and just get through life.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm male, 21 years old and living in Italy. I've felt depressed in the last years, but i think that it's only in the last two that i've got clinical depression. Sadly i don't have a diagnosis from a psychiatrist, it's just that my sadness is worst and i see nearly every symptom in me.

I just build a house with my wife. I never wanted to do it but because I had/have troubles saying what is important to me we did it. And by we I mean me. I coordinated everything, worked my ass of while it was build and had an extremely tense and devastating year of 2023. my batteries were empty when the construction phase ended and I was deeply depressed. Then the moment came and we moved in and I have to say that I hate the house. On the one hand it’s loud and build on a place I never wanted to live but if I am truly honest, it’s the house itself. Everything it stands for - the way my life turned out and how it is filled with things I never wanted. I fell into a deep state of depression, lost 10kg (20lbs) since march and was crying almost every day. But I pulled myself out of this hole by going to my therapist, doing sports and then eventually taking medicine against my anxiety. I found some ground again when I was recognizing something on my stomache while doing some woodwork and I went to the hospital. 2 hours later I was in the OR getting operated on my belly. Everything was good, I went home, fell in the same depression and was hit by extreme pain 2 days later. Went to the hospital again and had to stay 7 more days because my wound was infected. Now I have to rest since 6 weeks. Can’t do sports, can’t really move and I am deeply unhappy. I find happy moments while doing music and I was brave (or call it dumb) and went to a concert this week.

,SuicideWatch,"I often get made fun of for my poor English skills, which makes me really anxious about speaking. Just thinking about it gives me panic attacks. My classmates tease me about how I look, so I don’t really consider them friends. I’ve always dreamed of having a British accent, hoping it would help me fit in better. But most of the time, I feel lonely and isolated. At 19, I haven’t had the usual experiences like going to parties or having close friends. I worry about my future a lot and feel like I’ve failed, even though I used to dream of being an astronaut since I was four. Agoraphobia keeps me indoors; I’m too scared to go outside, even when my family goes on trips. I constantly think about my flaws and feel empty, much more than just typical teenage struggles.

Living in a developed country where everyone speaks English fluently makes me feel even more inadequate. I get jealous when I hear someone from another country speak with a perfect accent and flawless grammar, and it makes me feel like I’m not brave enough. Even my relatives, including my cousin, call me a coward because I’m afraid to speak English. Whenever I try to speak, it usually ends with people laughing or avoiding me. High school was tough; I was bullied a lot, called names like “monkey,” and people made hurtful jokes. My self-esteem is low, and I think I’m unattractive and unwanted. Whenever there are team activities, I’m always seen as weak or left out when others pick their teams. My parents favor my lighter-skinned brother, which makes me feel unloved and constantly compared unfairly.

In my native country, it was no better. My kindergarten teacher used to make fun of me and physically abuse me so severely that it lasted for years until I moved to the UK at 14. The teachers there shamed and physically abused me for minor reasons, but where I lived, this treatment was normal. My parents were also harsh; they would beat me severely for even the smallest mistakes, never giving me a chance to learn. My so-called friends used to mock my appearance, calling me ugly and making me feel worthless. Now, at my age, people make fun of me because I’m still a virgin. It’s led me to smoke and drink beer, neglecting my self-care and feeling like I don’t matter anymore.

I have always been labeled as weak and a failure, especially by my dad who constantly tells me I will never succeed. He looks at me with disappointment, seeing only failure. I’ve never achieved anything worthwhile; I feel like a coward and stupid too. Exams and assessments were always my worst nightmare; I consistently received the lowest marks. In group discussions, no one liked me because of my language barrier; they often ignored me or skipped over me altogether. I’m scared to become an adult because I feel too weak, and I worry that I’ll end up alone. These thoughts weigh heavily on me, making me doubt my ability to handle adulthood.Oh and btw lm black

I worry about my future a lot and feel like I’ve failed, even though I used to dream of being an astronaut since I was four. Agoraphobia keeps me indoors; I’m too scared to go outside, even when my family goes on trips. I constantly think about my flaws and feel empty, much more than just typical teenage struggles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Living in a developed country where everyone speaks English fluently makes me feel even more inadequate. I get jealous when I hear someone from another country speak with a perfect accent and flawless grammar, and it makes me feel like I’m not brave enough. Even my relatives, including my cousin, call me a coward because I’m afraid to speak English. Whenever I try to speak, it usually ends with people laughing or avoiding me. High school was tough; I was bullied a lot, called names like “monkey,” and people made hurtful jokes. My self-esteem is low, and I think I’m unattractive and unwanted. Whenever there are team activities, I’m always seen as weak or left out when others pick their teams. My parents favor my lighter-skinned brother, which makes me feel unloved and constantly compared unfairly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my native country, it was no better. My kindergarten teacher used to make fun of me and physically abuse me so severely that it lasted for years until I moved to the UK at 14. The teachers there shamed and physically abused me for minor reasons, but where I lived, this treatment was normal. My parents were also harsh; they would beat me severely for even the smallest mistakes, never giving me a chance to learn. My so-called friends used to mock my appearance, calling me ugly and making me feel worthless. Now, at my age, people make fun of me because I’m still a virgin. It’s led me to smoke and drink beer, neglecting my self-care and feeling like I don’t matter anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always been labeled as weak and a failure, especially by my dad who constantly tells me I will never succeed. He looks at me with disappointment, seeing only failure. I’ve never achieved anything worthwhile; I feel like a coward and stupid too. Exams and assessments were always my worst nightmare; I consistently received the lowest marks. In group discussions, no one liked me because of my language barrier; they often ignored me or skipped over me altogether. I’m scared to become an adult because I feel too weak, and I worry that I’ll end up alone. These thoughts weigh heavily on me, making me doubt my ability to handle adulthood.Oh and btw lm black 
l just feel like humanity has failed soo badly
Laughing at each other because of different skin colours it’s just stupid l wish for a better future 
l just wanna  Kms 
Hopefully l get peace &lt;/p&gt;

Sometimes I just think why was I even born?
I wish I could give my life to someone who is dying and wants to live. That will be so great. That's such a selfish thing to think about you will think but dwag u have no one no one to cry on my funeral to it can't be selfish thing.
I feel like I'm mentally being bullied idk the right word to use here.  I heard my teacher he teaches the subject in which I'm really weak at and he is the one not doing his job properly because he was calling me out in some other  class which doesn't make any sense.

,SuicideWatch,"I’ve been suicidal on and off for years. Most of my adult life, really.

There were times the thoughts were worse, I’d thought about how and where. I’d stashed pills ‘just incase’. I’d written notes. Never solid plans, but it was on my mind all the time. 

One night things got really bad and I had an episode that could have taken my life. I was ok but that was the start of me getting therapy and I worked on myself for years. I did eventually get better. I had turned my life around in a way and thought things were going to be good from then on. I was really proud of myself for all I’d overcome. I thought I had the chance of a good life, but it was a lie. It all crumbled. Long story short, the circumstances were all my fault but I lost the thing that mattered to me more than anything. My cat, I’d had her for 6 years since she was a kitten. I loved her so much. She was always there for me and she was the reason I didn’t act on my thoughts to end it, when the pain became overwhelming. I knew no one would love her how I did, so I stayed. Then I got better and always promised her that I’d keep getting better and build a good life for us. Instead I fell for a man who claimed to love me, but just used and abused me instead. My self esteem and identity and all the work I’d done to heal was undone. Worst was what happened with me giving up my cat, only for her to die, which was the most traumatic thing I’ve been through. I died that day too, really. Nothing has been ok since then. Not really. It is all my fault she is gone. She saved my life and I betrayed her.

I tried to heal. I really did. From the outside people would think I’m doing great. I left the toxic relationship. I got a new job. New place to live. Even eventually rescued a sweet dog from the shelter, who I of course do love, but it’s just not the same. It isn’t the same connection. It isn’t enough for me to stay for. The emptiness I feel without my soul cat is too great. The pain of her being gone, knowing it was my fault and she didn’t have to go, it’s unbearable. The anger I feel towards myself, and the anger towards my ex who broke me down and took everything from me. He got to move on without any consequences. While I am left a shell of who I was. I lost my life. 

I have fought before. I have been strong before, but I always had her to comfort me. This time is different. I am more tired than ever. It’s been over 3 years since then. 3 years of trying to move on without her. I don’t know if I can keep trying. I don’t want to die, but I need all this pain to stop. I dont take care of myself anymore. I’m doing the bare minimum to survive. 

I’m just surviving out of shame now really. Because I don’t want this dog to have to go back to the shelter, and because my house is a mess and I don’t want anyone to find it this way. I’m trying to work on organising my things, but I don’t have the energy. Maybe it’s for the best, because I worry about how I’ll go with 1 less reason to stay when I already have so few.

,SuicideWatch,"I doubt anyone will see this but I need to vent. I made this new page just to be able to say how I really feel without judgement.

 I’m sick and tired of this life. I’ve been through so much in life i could write a book and to top it off, my fiancé took his own life last year. I haven’t even hit 25 yet and my life feels ruined. ill never love someone the way I loved him. i’ll never get to have children now (pretty sure I can’t anyways due to endometriosis) or be married. i’ll never have my happily ever after (by choice, I refuse to find a new partner) i’ll never be the same person I once was.  

I’ve had on and off depression for years and i’m TIRED of it. i’m tired of faking like life is okay when it isn’t. i’m tired of hiding how I really feel. I’m miserable. I’ve tried taking my own life in dumb ways (OTC pills and eye drops, i know. dumb.) and of course I never took enough to cause actual damage. The worst part is i’m scared to do anything further because I don’t want to feel pain. It’s cowardly. Everyone says someone who truly wants to take their life will just do it, but it’s hard. This isn’t a cry for help, it’s just how i really feel. 

Every time i’ve tried, I got so sick and regretted it simply because I was still alive and throwing up. Never went to the hospital for any of my attempts. I suffered in my room in silence. My 2nd to last attempt I research for hours on drinking Visine (yes, the eyedrops). I drank 6 bottles and guess what? Nothing. I felt like I was nodding out and two days later I was back to normal. I was in the car with my friends and they didn’t even notice meanwhile my heart rate was slowing and i was losing hearing a bit. i fell asleep in my car and woke up hours later still alive. Why is it so hard?

 I hate expressing how I feel because then everyone looks at you like a charity case or says how ungrateful you are. I have been on depression meds, hate them. I won’t talk to a therapist or anything because advice doesn’t help me. I will fake like it does but it truly doesn’t. I’m so tired of being here!!! I’m so so fucking tired. “It gets better” Yes, it does for some people but i’m not one of them. I’ve had suicidal ideations daily for YEARS. I want to swallow all the pills I have right now but I can’t even fathom the fact of ANOTHER failed attempt and getting sick. Worst case scenario waking up in a hospital room with my family crying wondering what they could do differently. 

I miss my fiancé, I want to be with him. I don’t want to feel this pain anymore. I’m so miserable and there’s only one way out but it’s so hard to reach. It sounds sick but I pray every day that someone with a terminal illness and I can switch places. I would do it in a heartbeat. There’s so many people who want to live and don’t get the chance, why can’t I take their spot? I’m not selfish, I know how it sounds but it’s just how my brain is wired. I’m tired of heartbreak, waking up every day, having to pretend like I love life. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my family and I know people have it worse than I do, but man I just want to be gone. I don’t want my family to feel the way I feel about my fiancé leaving me which is why I hope for a freak accident or something to happen to me so they don’t have to feel guilt. i’m desperate to leave this world and I wish someone understood that.

I had my first suicidal thought when I was 14. Bad things happened involving someone I really cared about. I remember I was crying so much, and then I thought about fucking killing myself for the first time. After that, more shit started to happen, with that I begun with the selfharm and after that, smoking, just to try to feel less pain.

Last year, I had my first suicide attempt after a breakup. My parents were there to give me all the support I needed and that makes me feel like the worst person in the world. They don't deserve it. They deserve better, they deserve a child who don't fucking give problems. Does that makes sense? I don't have idea. I started dating my boyfriend in June 3 and things got better since then, but sometimes I feel like I'm not enough, and with sometimes I mean every fucking day. I want him to be happy and I'm fucking sure he won't be happy having to deal with trash like me. I'm so lucky to have him by my side but I hate myself so much that I catch myself thinking that I don't deserve to be happy and in fact I don't deserve any happiness. I'm a hopeless teenager whose only future certainly is death. I should just kill myself already and then my boyfriend would find someone better. Someone who don't selfharm every fucking day, someone who don't need to smoke to feel alive, someone better. Someone who won't give problems and will give him happiness. If by some reason you still reading this shit, I'm sorry for wasting your time, friend. Live a happy life and don't be a useless fucking trash as I did. 
I just need a final trigger to do it. I got ways to do it, I know how to do it, but I'm a fucking coward who have fear of pain. I want to die but I don't want to feel pain. Makes sense? Probably not.

I can tell my friends, colleagues and work management hate me now. They can’t stand my lack of communication of missing work, events, or other things. I reach out, and no support that they can give helps me. I just wish to die, a quiet and soft death. 

I wish I was brain dead, just a vat of meat that goes through the day, outside of the reality of my tired heart. I continue to hurt the ones who care about me. Just broke up with my partner in a manic episode and yearn to ask for help from them, but I can’t hurt them again. Then I think of the one who got away years ago, and I think of her everyday. I can’t even say that her hating me is a personal delusion, people have told me, she’s told me. I’m a selfish asshole, ‘fuck you’, ‘how could anyone love you’. I don’t know how anyone could either. I can’t reach out to her, and I know my friends resent the way I’ve treated both her and my most recent partner. I think it’s time for me to rot in the ground, or sink to bottom of a river. Just let me free. I’m planning on buying the helium tank tomorrow if I can afford it. I’ll pull into an alleyway close by the store and put the bag on my head. I’m ready to go.

Aditionally I expirienced some depersonalization at times and a very bad period of obbsesive compulsive thoughts that wrecked me.

I left myself be dragged by my own life, I had relathionship that meant the world to me, I can see how if I got any better it was because of her, she made me keep going. But wasn't as happy as she should and left, I don't blame her, she put up with so much shit from me. She did enough.

,SuicideWatch,"So, I’ve pretty much decided it’s time. I’ve got my method figured out and supplies ready- won’t disclose because it’s costly and will surely do the job, with the least amount of pain. Last time I attempted the gun misfired, that was a few years ago and I couldn’t bring myself to do it again.

That was what I thought was the lowest point in my life. I’ve wanted to die since I was 7, I was always different from everyone else, and bullied horribly for it. I transitioned into a girl when I was in my mid-teens. Got addicted to meth and heroin, and I just planned on using until I died. Unfortunately that didn’t happen fast enough and after 6 overdoses I guess I thought I couldn’t die. My family member actually was there with me one time and left me there alone in case I died and police showed up. I woke up projectile vomiting.
By the time I had gotten out of addiction I was an adult and my father (RIP) got diagnosed with an incurable degenerative disease and passed a few years later. I was working in the service industry and didn’t think about school.
 
One day I met my stbxh. When I tell you it was like the sky opened up and everything came together believe me, it was magical. I left the service industry for a better career path during covid, and started to actually make good money. Everything was looking good and I was feeling okay for once, but we (stbxh) were off and on every few months. Nothing and nobody compared to him, and I could never forget him, never could be with anyone else. So after a year separated, we got back together. Eventually we got married, I thought he had really changed. 

I ended up leaving my job to be a sahw. Life happened, time passed and one day he sat me down and said he wanted a divorce. The one person I ever truly loved and could see myself with, the most perfect man in the world really just pulled the rug out from under me again. Except this time I lost everything. Our home is his property, I had no job, no health insurance, nothing to fall back on except my mother. She and I share the same bed because all the other rooms are occupied by other family members. All of my stuff is still in boxes because there’s nowhere to put it. 

I really tried hard to pull myself out of it, I got a new job, got accepted into school, saved up for one of my passions, but the truth is that I can’t even think about enjoying any of the rewards of my hard work. I have literally no friends (none, I am completely alone and always have been. Except for one friend who I don’t talk to anymore because even that relationship was codependent), my family is addicted and dysfunctional, my poor cat misses her father and yowls every night, and the love of my life disposed of me once again like nothing. All I’ve ever wanted was to be loved like that, and I had it. Now it’s gone and I think about the life I’m creating now and it’s meaningless. I think about the future and it’s bright and fruitful, but it’s meaningless. I know I won’t ever feel that way for someone else and there’s no job, possession or accomplished dream that can replace it. My options are just too narrowed as a trans person.

So here I am at the even lower lowest point in my life. I’m ready, and I’m gonna make sure I don’t fail this time. I just really needed to tell someone because this has been a secret I’ve kept to myself for decades now so I don’t end up hospitalized. I’ve really thought about my options and this is truly the only feasible solution, I won’t ever be happy like I once was and I will be alone forever. And I’m so envious of people who can thrive like that but I’m not one of those people. I’m tired of being alone. I’m rambling, I’m sorry. I just needed to get this off my chest because no one knows. I know, this whole thing sounds stupid and pathetic. That’s definitely how I feel right now. Stupid, alone, thrown out, codependent and pathetic.

I’m 16 

I split with my best friend of many years because she had begun physically abusing me and then I told her I thought I was going to kill myself and she blatantly didn’t care. That was the beginning of the end. 

A few months later, she spread rumours all around my school that I lied about a bunch of random shit, the state I was born, my sisters name, my self harm, etc that I didn’t, but no one believes me for some reason, even though it’s so easy for me to disprove to everyone. Everyone is constantly talking so bad about me saying horrible and disgusting things and I couldn’t take it. So I stopped going to school for pretty much the rest of the year. I’ve been suicidal constantly since this, which was in April. 

Then my parents kicked me out but then randomly out of nowhere reported me missing when they found a paper I wrote before. It basically said if I didn’t check on them before the 20th I’m in danger but DO NOT report me missing under my birth name. For context I had my name legally changed and the original name is my most well guarded secret and embarrassment. Not sure why but hearing it makes me wanna seriously kill myself no joke. 

I said in the letter I wouldn’t kill myself so not to worry because they knew about how I’ve been the past few months UNLESS they reported me under my birth name after the 20th. Then guess fucking what they reported me missing despite kicking me out under my fucking birth name. There would be absolutely no reason they’d need to used this name, it’s not my legal name, it’s on none of my IDs. They were telling me to do it. They got me put in police custody and a mental ward, the worst experiences of my life. 

Now I’m getting further and further off the deep end by the day. I’ve started thinking my pets have been replaced by spies and every typing error I’ve made in this I’ve taken as I sign from God to kill myself. I got super worked up before writing this and usually I’d be calm by now but I’m not.

Plus, if a recession is coming, my position is about as safe as I can get, minus it killing me from stress. I just worked a 75 hour week and cried multiple times from stress. I work 9-5, then nights and weekends, and never get to leave work at work.

I’m 32 and through all of my 20s I had my own apartment, but couldn’t save anything because of rent prices. The last few years, I had the most awful neighbors of my life at two different apartments, and a roach nightmare. I couldn’t do it anymore, but I couldn’t afford a house on my own.

Then I moved into my parents’ house to save,  but I’m suffering mentally by giving up my freedom. Everything in my life feels out of control. 

And despite saving a down payment, the goal post keeps moving and prices and mortgage rates go up and up and up and I can’t keep up. It will still be years before there’s remotely any hope.

I’m extremely introverted and need alone time to function. Little things keep happening and I never get any peace between work, parents, personal life.

Charities and government-adjacent organisations do quite literally NOTHING apart from check that you've essentially registered as homeless (day one obvious stuff) and are aware of where to get a free meal every day. Presumably this is all they do all day and they are paid for it. Bizarre. Glorified directories.

I was on and off various SSRIs for years. Always been skeptical of them but in times of desperation I would go for it. Maybe some small benefit after a few months but hard to tell if it was that or other self improvement things I was trying. Either way, no meaningful difference. Therapy was a joke. Unfortunately, therapy and SSRIs are the only thing medical professionals recommend. ""I know you've tried A, B, C, D and E.... but you haven't tried F yet!"". Fuck you. Another flavour of pill is not going to change me, and my refusal to try is not proof I'm not serious about wanting to get better.

Despite having a long history of depression, whenever I've spoken to them recently they just latch onto the fact that I'm homeless. Obviously its not nice, but that's really not my issue. Worse still, it is very clear they think I'm just trying to score some free food from them and get somewhere to sleep indoors for the night. I've been to A&amp;E three times in five months. One time I was on the very edge of ending it, but they talked me down. The next time I visited I overheard them talking and they flat out stated they thought I was grifting so I left and decided to never speak to them again.

Last roll of the dice was to see my doctor because generally they're more qualified than the social workers role playing as mental health professionals. In addition to SSRIs and therapy she also recommended Jesus. In fairness, my medical history may have had my past beliefs on there which made her comfortable bringing it up - but what the fuck. Won't be going there again. 

Family are trash and not worth talking about. Haven't seen them in years and wouldn't want to. No friends either and I always have to ask myself why. I had them in school which is relatively easy when you're forced to see each other nearly every day. Genuinely enjoyed their company and would sometimes have periods where I would see them outside but it always burned me out after a while and I would pull back. We drifted apart but no hard feelings on my end. I was also involved in a bit of a scandal which definitely was my doing so that finalised things. Met nice people at various jobs but always kept things confined to the office and the occasional work party. Had a few girlfriends but never made it past early stages. The desire to keep it going was never there and I was happier alone. I'd have periods in my life where I told myself ""relationships aren't supposed to be easy, I need to sacrifice more"" and I would always end up hurting myself. Maybe I'm high functioning autistic or have some kind of personality disorder, who knows. Numerous professionals have asked if I'm ""sure"" I haven't been diagnosed with anything but they never press further.

Social issues aside, I have other flaws. I've always been lazy at work. I have known for long time that lack of sleep is a significant driver of my depression but efforts to correct this never lasted longer than a few weeks. I've drank alcohol excessively at points and gotten into some terrible states, though I have ""quit"" for months at a time when I felt like it. FWIW I've not had a drop in months, can't enjoy it living like this. I messed around with a married woman for a brief period despite her having kids and knowing she probably only latched onto me because of family issues she was having. Saying mean shit online. I have been cold to people and sometimes relished in knowing they were feeling hurt. Me simply getting involved in anyone's life knowing I will eventually make a mess.....its not right. This isn't just bad social skills, something else is wrong and I can't make it work despite a general desire to do the right thing and strong aversion to anything outright evil. The willpower isn't there to change myself in any meaningful way.

I've rambled. The burst of emotion which prompted this has faded but the final mission is still scheduled.

Fuck you to:
Teachers at school who witnessed me having a personality transplant overnight and never thought to ask what was wrong.
99% of homeless charities - and homeless people quite frankly.
The NHS. It's dogshit and needs to be pulled by the roots (not just based on my experience)

Thank you to:
My past girlfriends. Love will always be there, sorry I couldn't make it work.
My last two friends. It was only a year but it was special. And I promise I didn't fancy you-know-who. Objectively gorgeous but purely platonic on my end. 
People at work who tolerated me more than was reasonable. 
Everyone from church. Sorry for sudden departure.
The two charities that offered real help.

When I go, it won't be messy. Just a long sleep. Let's see what's next.

,SuicideWatch,"I need somewhere to get this out. I feel so lonely, and not even just an emotional loneliness, I genuinely am. My mother kicked my brother and I out after this huge fight about a lawsuit about a stupid will the rest of my family dragged us into. My fathers not alive anymore, which I mean, I’m kind of grateful for because he was heavily physically abusive. It’s just me and my brother now, and honestly it seems like he just hates me. He always comes home yelling, and threatening to hurt me when I’ve done nothing wrong. He doesn’t go through it that often, but when he does it’s so scary. I used to look up to him so much, he was my best friend. Then after everything happened, he got into weed and got this friend group and he started changing. I don’t even recognize him anymore. The rest of my family sided with my mother and is no longer in contact with us at all.

I did make a friend though, like an actual real life friend. The first real one I’ve had in years, and I think I annoyed her to death because she seems so uninterested in talking to me or wanting to do anything. I had this amazing online friend group, they were my reason and I loved them so so much. And then we all just started to drift, they were my only support, the only people I could talk to, and now the only time we message is when I’m in the middle of a panic attack and desperately need someone to talk to so I message them. They obviously hate me and that makes me want to cry because we used to talk on calls every day.

I’ve dealt with self harm since my father got sick (before he died) because he had convinced me that everything he did to me was deserved and every single little mistake I made, if he wasn’t there to show that I made it, then I had to. This past year has been so, so horrible. I don’t want these scars but I can’t stop. It’s getting so much worse, I’ve been cutting to fat and my brother found one of them and he got so pissed at me. 

Ive had a few attempts, most recent being a couple of months ago. My biggest one was back in November, I took a bottle of fluoxetine, a bottle of Advil, and just a bunch of other pills I mixed together. All it did was fuck up my organs and make my brother apparently hate me even more.

Having constant derealization/depersonalization episodes doesn’t help either. I used to get them every day, so it’s not as bad recently, but it’s definitely still at least a couple times a week. I just want to be normal. I wish I didn’t have to be terrified of going on walks (which is my favorite thing ever) and thinking a fucking building is melting or I’m in a dream. Everything is just so scary and I’ve been having so many breakdowns and anxiety/panic attacks and I hate it I hate it I hate myself so much. 

I’ve been starving myself recently as well. I wish I didn’t have to. I know I’m anorexic, it’s painfully obvious (direct quote from my old therapist) I normally go a couple days without food and then eat the bare minimum so I don’t faint. But I end up doing it anyway, and of course, my brother gets absolutely pissed at that too. Which I mean, understandable, but I’m trying to stop. It’s not like I want to count every single calorie I consume and think a godam piece of chicken is too many calories so oh no guess I can’t have that because it’ll make me go above my 400 calorie limit for the day.

I just can’t get rid of the thoughts. It’s every day now I think about suicide. Awhile ago I figured out this whole plan for a ‘peaceful’ way to do it, and then my dumbass decided to tell my old therapist about it and I got sent away. Every little tiny mistake I make the thought comes back. It doesn’t matter how good or bad my day was, it always ends with that thought and I don’t want to keep having to deal with it. I just want it to stop I want everything to go back.

I did start this new antidepressant medication though. I stopped taking my old ones because I heard they can cause weight gain and I was so terrified of that. But of course my idiot self keeps forgetting to take it (yes, I’ve set reminders) 

Honestly I don’t know why I’m even writing all of this. Just to put my thoughts down I guess. Really, all I want is for someone to just check in on me. I’m not saying I need like 50 people devoting their whole day to seeing how I’m doing, but just at least one person who cares enough. And not just because I ask them first or bring this up, but because they genuinely want to know. Because they care enough about me to want to know how I’m feeling. I mean it’s understandable if people wouldn’t want to, if I’m panicking I often send these stupid paragraphs to them and then I regret it after because if someone did that to me j wouldn’t know how to respond and I’m just putting them on the spot and then I apologize and I seem like a fucking wimp and I hate I feel so bad.",t2_kr7bew90,False,,0,False,Just needed somewhere to write this.

i told her she can come by tomorrow with my dad to see me and she said she doesnt wanna burden her sister and my cousin because if she doesn then they have to cook food and clean the house for her 

my dad coming over to check out a house and help me with my car and also drop off some stuff. 

she said she doesnt wanna run any errands with me and just overall says im not coming.

,SuicideWatch,"I can’t do it anymore.

This world sucks. We’re always reaching some unattainable goal of happiness, suffering through hours every single day just so we can get some dopamine later. I just don’t want to live that way.

My years have gone like this since I could remember:
January-June: Work, classes, sleep, repeat. Too tired to do anything fun because I get worn out.
June-August: Finally relaxing while I wait for impending doom
September-December: Work, classes, sleep, repeat again. 

I’ve repeated this endless cycle forever and I will continue it until the day I die because it’s impossible to break it. It’s simply life in civilization, and it’s come to the point where you can no longer choose to live in the forest or something, but I don’t like it. I don’t want to wait through months of suffering just to get some enjoyment out of life. All I’ve been told is “suck it up” or “I’m sorry, I understand” but that doesn’t give me a solution. I’m a control freak in a world with no control and it brings me misery.

My mother recently took away my self-harming tools and I’ve been at my breaking point. That was my last ditch attempt at coping and it’s now taken away by the people who love me so I can’t even get mad. I don’t think I’ll kill myself anytime soon, but I can’t see myself being alive any further than this. I’ll most likely do it by the start of the school year if something doesn’t change.

,SuicideWatch,"This is my first and maybe only post here. I'm 34/M. I've been suicidally depressed for many years, but ultimately have admitted to myself that I'll likely never drum up the blistering level of courage it takes to actually follow through. This, ironically, depresses me more than anything. I feel trapped here, unfulfilled and hopeless, because I lack the balls to put a gun to my temple and pull the trigger. 

I spend a lot of time reading and listening to material on suicide, its ethics, testimonials from those affected by it. It's a morbid form of research, but my hope is that I'll eventually find a way to be unafraid, or brave enough in the face of fear to commit. To me, the greatest possible tragedy is continuing on through the length of my natural life, always sad, angry, resentful.

So far, I'm too afraid to buy a gun or the necessary chemicals. But I always knew that if I ever committed, I wouldn't just leave a note. I'd write a small handful of individual letters to my friends and family, apologizing, telling them I love them, trying to explain. I decided to write those letters tonight, and I feel good about it.

,SuicideWatch,"I fantasize so often. I have no one to talk to because I don’t want help. My partner “doesn’t understand emotions”(their words ) so if I were to just finally relent to my urges then it’d be seen as a “surprise”. I have to pass on one day anyway so what is the difference if I go now? For the past few years, and on and off for as long as I can remember, I fall asleep by fantasizing about suicide. Or death of some other form. Like a car accident or some kind of tragedy that would spare me from the guilt of doing it myself. I have turned ugly and I don’t know who I am. I know things in my life are going wrong but I refuse to acknowledge those things because then I know I’m responsible for talking care of it when I just don’t care. I don’t feel affection like I used to. I don’t feel excited. Just scared all the time. I’m convinced there is someone out to get me and I want to get myself before anyone else has the chance to. I just don’t want to hurt my loving parents and siblings. But I am tired of this current shell im inhabiting. But I’m also scared. And I’m not interested in menial self harm for now. I used to harm myself in many ways. And back then when I felt this low that is what I’d resort to but now I don’t feel the urge to drag a razor or force my lunch up.

I have no one to talk to because I don’t want help. My partner “doesn’t understand emotions”(their words ) so if I were to just finally relent to my urges then it’d be seen as a “surprise”. I have to pass on one day anyway so what is the difference if I go now? For the past few years, and on and off for as long as I can remember, I fall asleep by fantasizing about suicide. Or death of some other form. Like a car accident or some kind of tragedy that would spare me from the guilt of doing it myself. I have turned ugly and I don’t know who I am. I know things in my life are going wrong but I refuse to acknowledge those things because then I know I’m responsible for talking care of it when I just don’t care. I don’t feel affection like I used to. I don’t feel excited. Just scared all the time. I’m convinced there is someone out to get me and I want to get myself before anyone else has the chance to. I just don’t want to hurt my loving parents and siblings. But I am tired of this current shell im inhabiting. But I’m also scared. And I’m not interested in menial self harm for now. I used to harm myself in many ways. And back then when I felt this low that is what I’d resort to but now I don’t feel the urge to drag a razor or force my lunch up.

I’ve been trying to tell people how I feel - what is going on in my head, but no one - absolutely no one - gets it!

My partner is beautiful, really supportive, but has no idea how close I am to totally losing it - and I can’t tell him for fear of screwing up our relationship and losing him.

I’m so unbelievably tired. I’ve spoken to work - they don’t give a crap, the Union, my local doctors … it’s like I’m screaming at the top of my lungs, but no sound is coming out.

And the amount of times I’ve heard ‘I’m listening’, then paraphrase and it’s nothing like what I’ve just described.

Feel like I’m being unreasonable and should just try harder, but then fall into the void all over again - and it’s getting harder to crawl back out.

No wonder so many people fall between the cracks and lose the battle.

It truly is an invisible disease. If you don’t look sick, you must be seeking attention or trying to get your own way / out of something.

And no one - NO ONE - listens!

I’m so tired and confused. Embarrassed and bloody lost.

At my age (in my fifties now) this shouldn’t be a thing. 

Shouldn’t we heal with time?

I have no idea what to do or who to turn to.

Just want to feel normal and enjoy life

There's something wrong with me. One second, I feel fine, I've decided I'm going to keep my job, and go to college. The next, I feel hopeless, and want to run away and do whatever I want.

I can't stand my job anymore. I hate it. It's pointless. I feel like I'm breaking my back over it.

I started meds for anxiety. It helps. And then I forget to take it, and it comes back.

I struggle to take care of myself. My room is a mess. I'm a mess. I forget to take care of myself.

I give into impulses all the time. I decide I'm going to save money, and then I go and make an impulsive purchase, like getting fast food.

I bought a used car. I thought it was a good car from a good dealer. Turned out to have problems. I feel like I wasted a lot of money.

I have no idea who I am. I feel like I want to be myself, but I'm scared of standing out. I tell myself I shouldn't care what people think...but I don't want people to judge me. I don't want attention, so I blend into the background. But apparently I'm supposed to be able to sell myself. I don't how to stand out!

I feel like my existence is wrong. Like I'm a bad person. There's no reason for me to be here. I literally don't even do anything, I just work stupid jobs I hate.

Honestly I felt so stupid and dramatic writing all this but I’ll post it anyway because idc anymore. 

I’ve been depressed and feeling suicidal for about 3 months now but things have gotten majorly worse in the past couple weeks. I don’t know how I make it through every day, I’m so bored and there’s nothing I enjoy anymore. The only reason I’ve made it until now is my family and my dog. However my family are going on holiday without me in 2 days. This is like the 5th time they’ve done it because I have severe anxiety and I can’t go with them. This time though, I REALLY need them. I’ve tried expressing what I’m feeling and had the help of my mental health worker too but they’re going anyway. My MH worker thinks they should go too and I’ll cope better than I think I will. I will have the support of my Grandma but I need my parents right now. I feel so stupid and childish but seriously they’re the only thing keeping me going. And while they’re away my dog is going to the kennels because I can’t even look after her by myself. 

I’ve expressed these thoughts mostly to my MH worker who has relayed them to my family but my family don’t understand why I can’t tell them these things myself. I’ve told them it’s very difficult. I’ve expressed the fact I want to die to all of them (MH worker and family) and I felt like they under reacted. Maybe they think I’m being dramatic and I wouldn’t actually do anything, which was true up until now but now I’m in such an awful place I don’t trust myself not to try to hurt myself or kms. Tonight I self harmed for the first time. I didn’t do much and am too much of a wimp to be honest but I had an urge to do it. I feel like I’m a manipulative bitch because it feels like the urge came from me wanting them to see how bad things are. I still have the urge to do more but like I said, I’m a wimp. Anyway I feel like if I tell my parents, everything will blow up. They get so stressed out about me and I know they need a break but I can’t survive that right now. I honestly feel so stuck. Dying seems like the only way out. 

I’ve also had intrusive thoughts about hurting other people. Like I said, I don’t trust myself. I would never do anything like that in my right mind but clearly I’m not in my right mind right now and I’m worried I’ll go crazy and snap. I genuinely don’t know what to do. If I don’t let my family go I feel like they’ll resent me. But it’s not like there’s even any way I can make them not go. So therefore suicide seems like the only way out.

My sister is having her first baby and as much as I'm happy and excited to be an aunt, she is moving to another country and doesn't seem to have any plans to have me very involved before she goes. She prefers her SIL who is more IG worthy. I've also been told I won't be blessed as the godmother (even though she is my sons). So, I feel like minimizing contact slowly would be easy.

My mother would be hard but somewhat easy.  She loves me very much but doesn't notice my absence for days. She usually prefers to just talk about herself and interests. Even when she asks for updates or what I'm watching I'm met with ""Anyway..."" almost immediately. 

My son would be the hardest. Since he's 19 and lives with me. But he is at the age where he only wants to focus on his friends. Should I keep encouraging time away from home with his friends and less time with me? He already thinks it's annoying when I ask him to hang out with me. 

My brother barely talks to me just because he's busy doing his own thing. But he's always seemed to have my sister's back more when it comes to us having boy trouble. He was at my sister's side when her ex cheated on her, but when I was raped he didn't even reach out. 

My friends have their own stuff going on and one of my best friends have already benched me in her life after she got married. She had her own new best friend and never includes me in anything. I think she's my best friend and I'm not hers really. My other best friend would be devastated so I think pushing her away would be best?  So it doesn't hurt her as much. She already has so much going on at home. My other close friend... only ever invites our other friend out and never me. She calls me her daughter's chose aunt but wouldn't even introduce me to her. ( I'm really good and safe with kids). She invited me to her daughter's party and seemed disappointed I showed up. She could have been busy with hosting though. So again, slowly disappearing might not be a bad idea. Right? 

I just... I just feel so invisible and worthless. My hobbies I love don't bring any sort of spark. Growing up all my friends abandoned even into adulthood. I've been abused, physically, emotionally, financially and sexually by different partners. I've been told I'm only good enough for one thing in relationships.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm not a good person. 

I'm a shitty son. Probably because I'm a shitty student and a shitty boyfriend. And I'm a shitty student because I'm fucking stupid or lazy, and I'm thinking it might be both. And in turn that makes me shitty at my job, which I already don't make that much money in.

I'm a shitty boyfriend because I push her boundaries. Especially during sex. I'm a monster to her. And I don't know why. She's the best thing in my life. She's my shining star. And I hurt her. Again and again and again. She says that I don't respect or love her. That she's just someone to fuck to me. I hate myself. Why did I become this person. Why am I hurting the person that I means so much to me and makes me to happy.

I want it all gone. Everyone would be happier if I disappeared right? My father wouldn't have to pay for me to go through school anymore. My girlfriend is so charming and smart and kind that she'd find someone better woth no problem.

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a shitty son. Probably because I&amp;#39;m a shitty student and a shitty boyfriend. And I&amp;#39;m a shitty student because I&amp;#39;m fucking stupid or lazy, and I&amp;#39;m thinking it might be both. And in turn that makes me shitty at my job, which I already don&amp;#39;t make that much money in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a shitty boyfriend because I push her boundaries. Especially during sex. I&amp;#39;m a monster to her. And I don&amp;#39;t know why. She&amp;#39;s the best thing in my life. She&amp;#39;s my shining star. And I hurt her. Again and again and again. She says that I don&amp;#39;t respect or love her. That she&amp;#39;s just someone to fuck to me. I hate myself. Why did I become this person. Why am I hurting the person that I means so much to me and makes me to happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want it all gone. Everyone would be happier if I disappeared right? My father wouldn&amp;#39;t have to pay for me to go through school anymore. My girlfriend is so charming and smart and kind that she&amp;#39;d find someone better woth no problem. &lt;/p&gt;

I joined clubs, gone swimming,lost a bit of weight, made friends.

Instead, I swallowed 900 mg of quetapine (I'm meant to take 600) and had a dozen glasses of alcohol (ouzo, beer, wine...)

But right now in the middle of the night I keep thinking of killing myself. One reason that's pushing me over the edge is that I've got a DBs.

20M, and i barely exist, i have no life in or outside of the house, i have a long distance boyfriend who is great to me and i love him dearly, but i can't fathom putting all of this on him, sometimes he acts in a way that makes me think that my emotions are too much for him, and i can respect that. so, this is truly my only and last choice to talk about this without many limits.  
  
i am unemployed and not schooling at the moment - i've taken a gap year, i was in high school when covid hit and finished my last years from my bedroom, where i have practically been almost every day since for the last three or four years. i am terrified to head into college with all these functional adults, and i've been suicidal since i was eight years old, and i never planned to make it to this age. this all means that i have no idea what to pursue in college, no idea what life i want to try and live. with the rise of AI creatives, i have been completely displaced in my (former) dreams of pursuing something artistic, though i'm fully aware that art hardly makes money, and that my skill does not exceed anyone's - i bring nothing to the table to make me worth looking at over AI anyway. 

as previous stated, i am essentially bed-bound - i've been trying to make more plans to get out of the house, but i can't drive and must rely on my only friend to come pick me up to get me from point A to point B, i do not make any money to pay back the gas that they spend, i am a burden and quite useless in this regard, and it fuels my idea that everyone in my life would be much better without me leeching off of them.

some issues that don't need much elaboration is that: i am overweight, i likely have PCOS (and may have possible fertility issues, i never wanted kids but to have the ability deprived from me when my body is already useless makes me so upset), i am a person of color, i am not very likable, i am unattractive, apart of the lgbtq+ community, i'm not very smart, i haven't achieved anything, i am a financial burden, an emotional burden, all of my hobbies that could potentially generate income - i am mediocre/subpar at, i struggle with a porn and masturbation addiction that i feel horrific about, through all of this, i have come to realize that i have *no* redeeming qualities that make me worth taking up the space that i do. i've tried accepting this fact, but i absolutely can't, because i am surrounded by people and social media that constantly reminds me that the people around me are so much better.

all this said, as a very brief **tl;dr, i have no redeeming qualities to make up for the space that i take up and for the burden that i am, and it's eating away at me.**

i'm still learning how to be an adult, like everyone my age, but *worse*, because i am horrifically behind the curve, with parents that coddle(d) me into adulthood, i am overly reliant and can only front for non-family to make it seem like i have my shit together, when i clearly don't. i think that at 20, i've definitely hit the limit for being like this and i feel the need to relieve everyone.",t2_66wt66uj,False,,0,False,i wish to relieve those that i burden,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e3ecyc,False,dark,0.99,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1720994964.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;first reddit post and i have no idea what i&amp;#39;m doing, sorry if this is a mess or has typos, but i have no one and nothing else to turn to.&lt;/p&gt;

Why do I dream about you?  
Why do I have you in my thoughts always  
I look at something and your name is there  
I think about you constantly

I loved you!  
I love you...

Were they all a lie? Of course not...  
I adored you....  
You said you loved me...  
How did we end up like this?  
Where did I go wrong?  
What could I have done

It was like glass... We were fragile, beautiful... I broke it...  
You cut me  
You fucking tore open my heart  
You sliced deep, stinging  
Painful cuts  
Only you could have cut me the way you did...

I want to hug you...

When did we get so backwards...  
Scars...  
they are a reminder...  
What did you want me to remember...?  
Why did you cut me so...  
So deep...?  
Was it apathy?  
Did you *really* not care...

Am I a fool for loving...  
Letting my walls down...  
Allowing someone into my heart?  
Only to be  
...  
...  
...  
Mutilated...

You fucking mutilated me!  
I... I fucking trusted you, loved you, adored you, in the deepest way...  
You were so close to me...  
I let you in...  
...

So it *is* my fault huh?  
*i'm* the dumb fuck?  
The one who was so **stupid**, to be vulnerable....  
To let myself show through this...  
facade...  
To think *stupidly*, to be so naive, that I believe that someone actually loves me...  
I'm sorry...  
I still do love you....

I do...

I want to tell you it&amp;#39;s okay...&lt;br/&gt;
When did we get so backwards...&lt;br/&gt;
Scars...&lt;br/&gt;
they are a reminder...&lt;br/&gt;
What did you want me to remember...?&lt;br/&gt;
Why did you cut me so...&lt;br/&gt;
So deep...?&lt;br/&gt;
Was it apathy?&lt;br/&gt;
Did you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; not care...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I a fool for loving...&lt;br/&gt;
Letting my walls down...&lt;br/&gt;
Allowing someone into my heart?&lt;br/&gt;
Only to be&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
Mutilated...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You fucking mutilated me!&lt;br/&gt;
I... I fucking trusted you, loved you, adored you, in the deepest way...&lt;br/&gt;
You were so close to me...&lt;br/&gt;
I let you in...&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; my fault huh?&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;i&amp;#39;m&lt;/em&gt; the dumb fuck?&lt;br/&gt;
The one who was so &lt;strong&gt;stupid&lt;/strong&gt;, to be vulnerable....&lt;br/&gt;
To let myself show through this...&lt;br/&gt;
facade...&lt;br/&gt;
To think &lt;em&gt;stupidly&lt;/em&gt;, to be so naive, that I believe that someone actually loves me...&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;m sorry...&lt;br/&gt;
I still do love you....&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
...&lt;br/&gt;
I do...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;W H Y&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fucking just want to know...&lt;br/&gt;
What I could have done...&lt;br/&gt;
What would have caused me, to... to still have you...&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;d take ignorance..&lt;br/&gt;
I&amp;#39;d ignore how terrible you have been to me..&lt;br/&gt;
I just want to be cared about again...&lt;br/&gt;
to be close..&lt;br/&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Hi friends. I know how stupid it sounds, but the title pretty much sums it up. I apologize that this also kind of gets a bit ramble-y. My mind is really racing atm. But thank you so much for even just deciding to read any of it, being noticed really means a lot. I will do my best to monitor this post and reply to anyone, but this is a throwaway account so bear with me if im slow.

I’m a 17 year old female surrounded by a friend group full of talented artists. For years I have struggled with this feeling of worthlessness because I lack any real talents. Everything in my life seems to revolve around art, and it kills me that im incapable of creating anything im proud of. My friends and I are sort of nerdy and really enjoy making characters and plots and stories together… but it pains me so much that I cannot put what is in my imagination onto paper or tablet. All of my friends get so much joy out of spending time drawing, and I just wish I had that. I am constantly whining and complaining about how bored I am and how much I wish I had a hobby. I have been doodling from time to time since such a young age and even after all these years I have never gotten better. “Practice makes perfect” is one of the biggest lies I have ever heard. Some people just have a natural talent. Yes, practice is important… but it just doesn’t help if you don’t have the initial spark. I’ve tried so hard, I really really have, but any time I try to bring myself to try again, all I want to do is break down crying. All I can do is compare myself to my friends. I know how dumb it is, but I am genuinely considering killing myself just because I have no artistic talent.. it’s all I’ve ever wanted in life and it’s simply not doable. All I want is to be able to fill my mundane life with something that makes me happy. Something that brings me even the smallest bit of joy. But I can’t. I’m simply not good enough, and never will be. I don’t know where to go from here. I don’t want to die, but I don’t want to keep living so miserably. This is maybe the closest I have ever been to ending it once and for all. I have never previously attempted, but have had police show up at my house to do a welfare check in the past. I wasn’t necessarily planning anything, but I was definitely in a rough mindset. Im just too afraid to really try, and don’t want to hurt my friends and family, as well as my boyfriend (who also heavily struggles with mental health) because he has told me so many times that he would kill himself if he ever lost me to suicide. I don’t want to rip two families to shreds just because of me…

TL;DR: Surrounded by people more talented than me, constantly brought down by my lack of talent. All I’ve ever wanted is to be able to draw, but im simply not good enough for it. I just want to be able to do something that will make me happy because my life is so mundane feeling.

,SuicideWatch,"What should i do if my bf got strong suicidal attempt?

I’ve been dating him for a while and things always go fast and smooth between us, i can say everything is going quite well so far, and we just past the first month of our relationship.

Technically speaking, he’s the very first serious partner in my life and i cherish this relationship a lot, we love each other a lot too.

He told me from the start that he got some mental issues, so yes he has drug problems but nothing like addict, i know it can relieve him sometimes but i hope i can help him to gradually quit this.

At first, he always said things to me like “baby u are legit the only reason that i wouldn’t kill myself” or “i wanna try to quit drugs for u”, i was quite touched and motivated, i sort of wanted to *save* him, i know it’s stupid though but i still feel like so.

A big problem in this relationship is that, most of the time we have to do long distance, his hometown is close to me but not where he does uni right now.

So last time when we saw each other, we spent 4 days together, there was this night where everything was so good, vibe was alright, until he told me maybe we need to face reality of long distanceand other things.

I’ve always been an insecure person and when he kept emphasizing *reality* i bursted out crying and i ended up crying for almost an hour, out of breath. But he was too, there was this moment that he can’t help himself so he escaped to the bathroom just so i wouldn’t see him crying out loud. But i did hear it, of how he was out of breath like me.

From this i know at least we really love each other and i also told him that i really want us to work out.

But today, he texted him quite a bit less than before so i asked him if everything’s alright, he said he’s hungover and tired. And he said he’s worried about me, for being too attached to him that if one day he leaves me i’d be too traumatized and even ruin my own life. So he’s trying to let me withdraw. He also said things like he think he would *eventually kill himself* because of all those issues, and they are getting worse every year and he doesn’t know if he can handle it.

I cried again, but instead this time i couldn’t cry in his arms and feel his firm hugs, and everything of this relationship suddenly feels like time bomb right now.

I feel so sad thinking about all these beautiful things have barely started but i already have to prepare to be losing them, it really breaks my heart.

I tried to put myself into his shoes, i know i can’t help him because it’s actually not about me but himself. He does love me, so he wants me to be less sad if bad things really happen one day.

I really don’t know what to do right now. Unlike other crisis, this one makes me feel really weak, and my heart hurts everytime just by thinking about it.

All i ask for right now, is that he can live on long as he can, even if he loves someone else after me, even if we couldn’t be together.

,SuicideWatch,"Sorry if my english is not good, I’m european. I don't usually write personal things on Reddit but I really need to get this out because I have no one.

I was with my ex for 4 years, until February this year. I'm 28 (almost 29) and she's 32. These 4 years we always had a good time and we did a lot of things together. We shared a lot of interests: anime, video games, love of animals, volleyball. We attended the same volleyball team and over the course of these 4 years her friends also became mine; I have never had many friends, in fact practically none, whereas with them I had found a group of emotionally intelligent, funny people with whom, together with her, we met to role-play every weekend. 

Then in the last year the situation started to go badly.
For a variety of reasons related to our respective situations at home, she no longer came to my house, and I no longer went to her house. Specifically, I no longer went to her house because her retired mother was always there smoking and we didn't have a shred of privacy, she didn't come to me because my house was always either too cold in the winter or too hot in the winter. summer, because while studying at university I didn't have the money to pay the heating or air conditioning bills.

The problem was that she simply seemed to have accepted the fact that we could only see each other once a week, on the weekend, and only with our (her) friends. The more I asked for a solution to be able to carve out time for ourselves too, the more she told me that, due to the situation at our homes, this was not possible. Punctually when I brought up this topic we argued, because I seemed insistent, and it seemed absurd to me that she considered a relationship based only on this.

Sex was gone.
We went from doing it less and less, to doing it once every month and a half/two, until we didn't do it anymore from June last year until November. 

She just didn't seem to feel the need to spend time alone with me. We saw each other either at volleyball, or with her friends.

In November last year, after yet another argument, we took a break, in which we continued to see each other only as friends doing the usual things, that is, seeing each other at volleyball and on Saturday evenings at our friends' house.
During this break I thought a lot about the situation, and I was ready to change to start again for the better, but in February she instead told me that she no longer wanted to continue, and that if I wanted at most we could just remain friends, because being together as a couple it made her feel bad.

This thing literally broke me open and made me a non-functioning human being.

I loved this girl and I still love her, I wanted to build a life and have children together.

I left the volleyball team and the group of friends because hearing or seeing her again made me feel too bad, so now I'm completely alone. 
I have no friends, I have no family, I have no girlfriend, I have nothing. 
I see a psychologist every two weeks but it isn't helping me at all. 

Since February I have done nothing but work, come home and stay in bed, I no longer function as a human being. All I do is think about what I could have done better to prevent her from leaving me. I'm eating out of regulation and staying in bed all day. I finish work (remote work), I throw myself into bed, stare at the PC until late at night and start a new day like this, uninterruptedly, since February.
At almost 30 years old I feel completely finished.

Yesterday I indirectly discovered that she is seeing another person.

I just want to kill myself, I can't live like this anymore. I feel like im in a movie theatre after the movie has ended, watching the shut off screen in the dark.

I don&amp;#39;t usually write personal things on Reddit but I really need to get this out because I have no one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was with my ex for 4 years, until February this year. I&amp;#39;m 28 (almost 29) and she&amp;#39;s 32. These 4 years we always had a good time and we did a lot of things together. We shared a lot of interests: anime, video games, love of animals, volleyball. We attended the same volleyball team and over the course of these 4 years her friends also became mine; I have never had many friends, in fact practically none, whereas with them I had found a group of emotionally intelligent, funny people with whom, together with her, we met to role-play every weekend. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then in the last year the situation started to go badly.
For a variety of reasons related to our respective situations at home, she no longer came to my house, and I no longer went to her house. Specifically, I no longer went to her house because her retired mother was always there smoking and we didn&amp;#39;t have a shred of privacy, she didn&amp;#39;t come to me because my house was always either too cold in the winter or too hot in the winter. summer, because while studying at university I didn&amp;#39;t have the money to pay the heating or air conditioning bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem was that she simply seemed to have accepted the fact that we could only see each other once a week, on the weekend, and only with our (her) friends. The more I asked for a solution to be able to carve out time for ourselves too, the more she told me that, due to the situation at our homes, this was not possible. Punctually when I brought up this topic we argued, because I seemed insistent, and it seemed absurd to me that she considered a relationship based only on this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sex was gone.
We went from doing it less and less, to doing it once every month and a half/two, until we didn&amp;#39;t do it anymore from June last year until November. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She just didn&amp;#39;t seem to feel the need to spend time alone with me. We saw each other either at volleyball, or with her friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November last year, after yet another argument, we took a break, in which we continued to see each other only as friends doing the usual things, that is, seeing each other at volleyball and on Saturday evenings at our friends&amp;#39; house.
During this break I thought a lot about the situation, and I was ready to change to start again for the better, but in February she instead told me that she no longer wanted to continue, and that if I wanted at most we could just remain friends, because being together as a couple it made her feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This thing literally broke me open and made me a non-functioning human being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved this girl and I still love her, I wanted to build a life and have children together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I left the volleyball team and the group of friends because hearing or seeing her again made me feel too bad, so now I&amp;#39;m completely alone. 
I have no friends, I have no family, I have no girlfriend, I have nothing. 
I see a psychologist every two weeks but it isn&amp;#39;t helping me at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since February I have done nothing but work, come home and stay in bed, I no longer function as a human being. All I do is think about what I could have done better to prevent her from leaving me. I&amp;#39;m eating out of regulation and staying in bed all day.

I don’t feel like living. I have nothing to live for. I’m only existing because my parents are still alive. I can’t kill myself yet, I have to provide them with a good life as a token of gratitude for raising me. Other than this, I truly have nothing to live for. 

I’m not the best at socializing, I’m not beautiful, I’m not Asia’s beauty standards sort of skinny, I don’t have any particular talent. I feel like I’m such a waste. 

Sometimes I want to just kill myself but I can’t. I have to wait until my parents pass, as morbid as that sounds. Only then, will I allow myself to do it. I’ve already envisioned how my death would go. Carbon monoxide poisoning, along with my favorite melody and a beautiful sunset.  My country has stunning sunsets, so it’s perfect :)

,SuicideWatch,"I'm quite stable with suicide thoughts for a few weeks now. Even tho I'm still very depressed I barely think about killing myself. Actually I don't even think about it at all anymore. 

I'm far away from a happy person but I was kinda happy that I may slowly turn into a normal person again. 

However yesterday was a meet up with a few of my class mates. At first I didn't really want to go there since I'm still depressed and I would love to spend my whole weekend alone in my room playing video games and eat junk food. 

However I convinced myself to go and it was actually quite fun. I drank alot of alcohol tho together with my classmates. Once the party was over I decided to walk home since I only live 20 minutes in walking distance. 

On the way home the suicide thoughts kicked in. I went to a local parking garage and went on the roof. I sat there for a while looking down and thought alot about if I ever have the balls to jump and end it. 

I didn't plan on doing it but I kinda played with the idea. I decided to walk home and sleep but once I was home regret feelings kicked in. Regrets about all the life decisions I took so far. I was really disgusted by myself and I ended up cutting my arm which is something I have never done before. It didn't even hurt and that was kinda scary. Now the next day arrived and I'm sobber. 

My arm is quite bloody and I regret doing this alot. I have a family meeting tonight and I will visit my girlfriend tomorrow. I kinda need to hide these wounds now but don't really know how. I don't want people to think I'm going down the path of physical self harm since this is something I have never done and don't want to do again. 

I'm very disappointed in myself that I did it and I'm scared that I will eventually get back into a suicidal state. I'm currently completely fine just slightly depressed and anyoed that I did that. Also scared. 

I just want a normal life but moments like this make me think if this is even possible for me.

I’m writing letters and feeling better now that I know that I’m finally going to do it. Me too wish for a world without me in it. 
I would have loved to experience love longer
Or have a family and live the experience most people with healthy brain does.
But I’m okay I know that this is what I meant to do from the beginning&lt;/p&gt;

Hii im \[20, F\] actually thinking about commiting bcs i feel my life has come to the point where i cannot keep going. Ill explain, i had an extremely sad and rough life which has caused me trauma and personality disorders such as bpd. I was s3xually abus3d as a child (cocsa) and as a teenager by older teenagers. This led to several identity issues for me with my sexuality. i became fixated on sex by age 6, which only made my situation worse as i would try to have sex with people and the only people who would have me were pdf files.  I became exposed to pdf files and pdf file p0rn by some of my abusers by age 13. my mouth was r4ped at that age and i developed an oral fixation. I became addicted to smoking cigarettes and marijuana, also took a bunch of drugs and acohol during my teenage years, as one does, and i developed an addiction to benzos. i started to sell pics of myself to pay for my addiction. This benzo addiction kept going until i was 18 and my family sent me to rehab. I recovered and had to be put on medication for my issues. abilify and prozac, i take them to this day. I also had an ED during my adolescence and self harm issues. I am now recovered but i ache greatly as i want to feel how i felt before, i felt alive. I have gained like 40 kgs since my ed and i wish i could go back to how my body was since i no longer find myself cute or fuckable. i dont go outside anymore, i dont have “friends“ to “hang out with”, i have a psychiatrist and psychologist but nobody else to talk to. I only stay at home and play online (Dont have online friends either). I am extremely unbearable in relationships so nobody will put up with me, i am also ugly so its hard enough. should i just off myself as i am clearly in for a long life of suffering? My memory will not cease and i cannot forget how good having friends and taking drugs felt, or how greatly being loved by someone feels like. i still havent finished school yet because im a loser who failed chemestry and its been years since. should i just kms?

,SuicideWatch,"I dont feel like i deserve the gift of life . Basically, i got with this girl, which was my my mates ex, breaking bro code. I did so bc of a mixture of loving her as a person, greed for my own self, and the fact i felt sorry for her as his ex allgedly violated her(not true and it fucked me over, you'll find out soon). It was smooth sailing for the first week, chill, no drama, but since the group found out abt us being together, they aint happy. As a result I pressured her to let me expose him of his alleged crime to the group. They called cap, kicked us out. She got very upset, so much so that on our date, i had to stop her from scratching herself (self-harm) because of it. I thought i was in the right all this time, even kids helpline said it was violation. Keep in mind she has past trauma, and she had not been shaking and being this stressed since it. 

She then called the cops and they said it wasn't S/A, for a valid reason which both of us had overlooked. We then apologised to the group, and she left me on her own accord, which i accepted. Not only have i caused her to legit stress about this, making her want to disappear (she is moving schools bc of this), but ive almost caused the mate i stole her girl from to commit suicide, as i yelled at him with not very nice language abt this when confronting him, threatening to blackmail him and mentally tortured him. Sure the last bit was my fault; the group hates me and her now. I feel that it was all 100% my fault, even though i was only trying to pass the message on. Ive caused her and her ex emotional damages beyond my comprehension. 

Ive had a panic attack about this too. This is not the only incident i have hurt people, as i used violence alot, bullied, and was an overall dick to alot of people last year.

that being said, my relationship with my SO is great, i love him a lot, he’s usually affectionate and appreciative of me.

but then he gets in these moods. he’s got depression that tends to come and go. when he’s depressed he blames me for every problem that HE caused in our relationship.

he cheated on me (if you can call it that, he stayed texting random bitches who live across the country from us) … we fought a LOT about it but stayed together. he’s shown me he’s sorry, and he’s the one who came out and told me about it on his own. i didn’t find it or nothing.

his problem with all that though is that i was “so angry” and when he’s depressed he says he thinks about it and can’t let it go. i understand that, i slapped him as hard as i could across the face. but fuck man, how would you respond?

oh, and the fact that his mom and family found out about this and hate ME??? not for the slap, i don’t know if they even know about it. because i was so angry at him even though i stayed with him. i was angry so i said a lot of hurtful shit. i get that. i fucked up.

but he always acts like we’re past it when he’s happy. couples go through shit, right?

i really have no purpose if not for him. all i do it work, cook food for him (i’ve realized that’s my love language) and try and help him with his dream career. he works a more physical job while working on his career on the side. the only chore i ask him to do is the dishes. we both are working now to save up money, he said once i’m pregnant and i can stop working if i want and he’ll provide. i’m happy with that.

,SuicideWatch,Ever since 2020 I've felt more and more disconnected from society and people at school especially after what happened at home where my dad beat my mom. I feel so guilty for only making things worse for my mom and being against her instead of with her while she was being abused by my father. I feel like I've been an asshole to everyone who's ever tried to help me and I feel like sometimes I just bring misery into this world. I feel spurts of productivity sometimes but then I feel really depressed and alone. I just want someone who I feel like I can open up to and love. I just don't know if I can go to my mom as I don't feel comfortable opening up to her and I genuinely think that her life would've been better if she never met my dad and thus never had me. I've done so many awful things and I think that maybe I'm just a bad guy. I wish I was never born so then I nobody would be hurt from me and I wouldn't feel this hurt. I feel like I've caused so much pain to my mom and I just want her to be happy. I feel empty a lot of the time and things don't fulfill me like they used to. I'm not sure if things will ever get better sometimes because sometimes it feels like life is going in a loop. I feel so betrayed by my father because I loved him so much but he just kept abusing me and my mother and it hurts so much to think about how he never really loved me even though I loved him. Sometimes I envy my sister because she never had to live through any of this since she died at birth. I'm always too scared to kill myself and sometimes I feel better so it makes me hopeful but then it fluctuates a lot.

,SuicideWatch,"Years ago I first started developing depression and anxiety symptoms due to bullying and stress in school, mainly due to being neurodivergent. It made my life a living hell because I had no friends and my own family would call me r3tarded or say I was “acting dramatic” if I tried to open up. If I showed any deeper symptoms, they’d tell me I’d get locked up in “The Loony Bin” where I’d be strapped down to a bed and pumped full of pills like a slave. Hearing that was already terrifying enough, but to hear very real and very similar incidents happen to people I knew didn’t make it any better.

None of them know this, but I almost went through with overdosing one night in the 7th grade due to a humiliating incident that turned out to be my breaking point. For whatever reason, I just couldn’t go through with it. Maybe it was my dog or my few online mutuals on PopJam, but instead, I just cried myself to sleep and foolishly hoped that I wouldn’t wake up the next morning. I had a similar incident due to an ex, but that was less severe I think. 

My family would always tell me that “depression was temporary and it’ll go away on its own” but it never did for me.

Years later those thoughts just became passive. I didn’t want to kill myself, but at the same time I didn’t care what happened to me anymore. I didn’t care if I got kidnapped, or got run over, or anything like that. As long as it was quick I wouldn’t mind. There were times I would walk on bridges and have intrusive thoughts about jumping off. 

Even when going through diagnosis stuff and even when some people asked, I could never tell the full truth that I had suicidal thoughts. The idea of being abused, assaulted and cut off from the rest of the world in a closed facility was a concept worse than death to me. Even prisoners had more rights than that. It was essentially a punishment for not getting the job done yourself, run by people that only saw broken individuals as trash to be repurposed instead of fixed.

But I’m tired of living in mental exhaustion everyday, waiting for something else to kill me. I’m tired of not knowing what I want to do with myself one day and feeling like I’m just a useless background character in everyone else’s life. I actually have a few people I care about and want to stay for. But I don’t want to keep living like this anymore and I don’t know how to change the way I feel. I’ve tried getting out more and getting into hobbies but they’re never permanent solutions to the pain. I want to tell someone so maybe they’ll finally understand why I am the way I am. But I don’t want to risk being tortured if I say the wrong thing or too much. If anyone has any advice, I’d appreciate it.

,SuicideWatch,"I just want to state I'm doing okay in terms of a place to work and a house to stay at. I'd say I'm dealing with less stress than the average person working in the US. The issue is I'm breaking mentally when I thought I overcame some of my biggest problems that held me down. I use to deal with a lot of depression and anxiety. It held me back horribly and I tormented myself In the past thinking how the way people treat me I must deserve to suffer. I thought that maybe I had done something so horrible in a past life that I absolutely deserved the hurtful things friends would do to me. I'd lay in night crying about how I would be better off if I had disappeared and the only thing that stopped me was not wanting to end my life just out right sense who knows where you go and what damage I would cause to people finding out I killed myself. Even my family treated me horrible as a kid I know I was not raised well. I wasn't raised horribly but I still went through stuff that caused me to develop how I felt about how I deserved to suffer. I know it was what caused my anxiety. Even back then when I expressed my severe panic attacks no one tried to help. They even found out I was cutting cause I tried getting help through a suicide hotline who just threw cops my way so I had to get cuffed and sent to a mental hospital. Explains why I don't go there for help anymore.

Of course I no longer face this exact challenge of hating myself. I actually have grown to accept the things I like and and who I am. I have bought things I like to look at like art and just stuff that would help me. Ultimately I begun taking care of myself and loving myself. With all of this it was very impowering I felt good about life. The last time I felt depression/anxiety was 5 months ago when my bestfriend who I talked to everyday for a year started ghosting me. She had moved back home and shortly after the energy we equally put in started halting. I gave it time thinking oh she just wants to be with family for a bit. A month passed. I had grown to hold a lot of anxiety and concern the friendship was ending. I expressed my feelings of how ever sense she moved back home I felt I wasn't someone she liked anymore. Like I was just used to pass the time she was away from home. I only received deflections and how my comment hurt her. I was just shocked.

What made all of this worse is I had just helped this friend get a new pc with a good amount of money. Money I was anxious to spend but there were no issues in the friendship prior. We always worked things out we always played games and did voice chat. When she needed someone to vent to I tried to be there for her. I gave her advice helped her away from bad friends. Showed her how to be more positive and get through work. I put so much into it and I loved it. That friend felt like a sister to me that I didn't have. Just like that though I was no longer even a thought to them. They said they would pay me back first. They ended up paying others back first. I asked them about it. They said how I told them they could take their time. I did. Though there was absolutely desire being shown to pay me back. 2-3 months in no money was given back. I was dying over this. I spent a year with this person almost daily sharing so much. Now I'm not only not worth talking to but I'm not even worth getting the money back that I so kindheartedly loaned. Remembering hearing how she looked up to me so much. Hearing how I helped so much. So I guess it wasn't meant at all. Or they liked my actions but not me as a person. Eventually I had looked into stuff and my mind switched. I was done treating myself bad over all the stuff that went wrong.

I started taking care of myself and buying things for myself. It honestly didn't feel as good but I know it was helping and after sometime I realized how horrible those close friends were to me. So I started trying to better determine my friends and started a goal of staying out of friendships that had drama. Anyone who I had issues with I put a long stick between us at the very least. This horrible event at least gave me room to treat myself better. Then it started. I started realizing how sickening it was for people to treat such a sweet person like that. To selfishly use me like that. Use me as a wallet. Use me for emotional validation. Use me to fill in their boredom. Most of the closest people hurt me the most. Said some of the most vial things I had heard. It all ended on such bad terms. It made me question if I should have anymore close friends. Shortly after someone who I considered a friend started trying to make me mad. I knew what they were doing cause they started instigating things. They even expressed how they were trying to instigate. I can't just leave this friend because a good friend hangout with him. I'd have to leave as a whole.

All of these little details all of these little actions that I saw in people. I saw how sickening we are as Humans. We steal from people who love us. We use them like tools. We do anything to make ourselves feel better even if it means someone dies. What was unbearable an amount of depression and anxiety is now an unbearable amounts of anger building up more and more. I knew how everyone close to me treated me so disgusting. No one sacrificed anything for me. No one did anything that was at their inconvenience. No one in this world wants to be understanding. No one wants to put in the same effort all the time. My friend group is getting smaller and smaller. I don't make anymore friends. So it just seems like a painful process of me losing all my friends in some disgusting way eventually and I'd have no way of know sense most just switched up on me. Where they take advantage of me or use me in any kind of way. Where at the end of it my health is never a concern to them. Its disgusting how much stuff I dealt with that was horrible as someone with such a big heart.

Now I don't know who to trust anymore. I don't know whos going to toy with me next. I know I can't make any friends not that I don't talk to people but because I'm such a different person from everyone else. My interests are niche and very few people ever know them. No one really gets my way of joking a lot and Im so spastic. I have a lot of energy and I just act dumb because its fun. I don't hate me for this but I know the way I am doesn't bring anyone in which as a human is making me feel very lonely. So while I'm losing people there is absolutely no one showing up in life. I'm growing up and I know less and less people will like my way of joking and interests. Its just saddening cause I use to love people and I wanted to give someone the most a human could. I wanted to experience true love. The closer I got to this it felt like life was stabbing me in the most painful way it could. People I thought I knew who lured me in only to use me and throw me away.

So despite wanting to love people and care for people and help I now Just feel so much disgust and hatred. I'm so full of anger and it gets worse everyday. I stay physically active to hopefully burn off this anger but I can still feel it there. Even if I manage to get it out of my mind during it comes back. Its just there. I'm so disgusted by what Human do. It feels like truly humanity was never full of love. It was never a place with good people. I just hate how no one cares. Whats the point. Whats my purpose. I just want to say fuck it and leave everything. I don't want to deal with this shit anymore. Getting close to someone just means a big chance at me getting screwed over in some way. I don't know how to feel or what to do now. everything is just feeling worse. I just feel like blowing my brains out. There is no good here. I won't even feel that happiness i did from friends in anything else and I've been trying. I want to be happy but I can't find anything to distract me away from this anger like those friendships did. I love my hobbies and interests but I'm not a fueled to them. At least when i do them yes I enjoy it but this anger comes back.

I'm so sick of it. Its tormenting. You think you make it into a peaceful happy life then either someone or life itself kicks you down as soon as you get better. I just don't want to be here anymore. Not even cause I hate myself. I actually want myself to be okay so just imagining ending it all being free from this painful headache. From all the sickening humans out there. That sounds lovely. Its sound like that would be the only thing I'd have to finally put my mind at rest. No more emotions that take over my life. It would be fine if I could be okay for a whole year without breaking down so bad like this. But i don't ever get that. Sense 13 my like has just felt like shit. I don't know how to feel anymore. Yeah maybe I can ride this out but ya know when you actively snap into a positive mindset finally and then anger comes along to kick it out. Well whats the point. All of that work is gone. Its obviously impacting my friendships and even work. I can't talk to people when the thought of blowing my head of is in my mind or when the crippling disgust of all the horrible things people have done to me is catching up. I'm just so annoyed now. I haven't hurt anyone but I've just stopped showing up. Only 2 fucking people would care about where I am and the other would be concerned about me.

Well I don't know if anyone will read this. I don't really have anyone to go to with this. Its funny I wanna give up on Humanity and stop relying on people but I'm here. I just want peace really. Also if anyone is concerned please don't have police show up again. That actually caused me to lose a lot of trust too. Maybe I'm just paranoid now cause how would they tap my stuff on here but whos knows. Just send the police to deal with the guy who needs comfort and care. I know it would be expecting a lot for some to read and respond sense nothing is ever really free but yeah. Well thanks if anyone does. I'm gonna lay down and hope I can swiftly fall asleep before it gets even worse.",t2_a9xbyjp7,False,,0,False,I'm losing hope in humanity and things just keep getting worse,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,,,0,,False,t3_1e2qav2,False,dark,1.0,,public,5,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,5,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1720920476.0,text,,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just want to state I&amp;#39;m doing okay in terms of a place to work and a house to stay at. I&amp;#39;d say I&amp;#39;m dealing with less stress than the average person working in the US. The issue is I&amp;#39;m breaking mentally when I thought I overcame some of my biggest problems that held me down. I use to deal with a lot of depression and anxiety. It held me back horribly and I tormented myself In the past thinking how the way people treat me I must deserve to suffer. I thought that maybe I had done something so horrible in a past life that I absolutely deserved the hurtful things friends would do to me. I&amp;#39;d lay in night crying about how I would be better off if I had disappeared and the only thing that stopped me was not wanting to end my life just out right sense who knows where you go and what damage I would cause to people finding out I killed myself. Even my family treated me horrible as a kid I know I was not raised well. I wasn&amp;#39;t raised horribly but I still went through stuff that caused me to develop how I felt about how I deserved to suffer. I know it was what caused my anxiety. Even back then when I expressed my severe panic attacks no one tried to help. They even found out I was cutting cause I tried getting help through a suicide hotline who just threw cops my way so I had to get cuffed and sent to a mental hospital. Explains why I don&amp;#39;t go there for help anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course I no longer face this exact challenge of hating myself. I actually have grown to accept the things I like and and who I am. I have bought things I like to look at like art and just stuff that would help me. Ultimately I begun taking care of myself and loving myself. With all of this it was very impowering I felt good about life. The last time I felt depression/anxiety was 5 months ago when my bestfriend who I talked to everyday for a year started ghosting me. She had moved back home and shortly after the energy we equally put in started halting. I gave it time thinking oh she just wants to be with family for a bit. A month passed. I had grown to hold a lot of anxiety and concern the friendship was ending. I expressed my feelings of how ever sense she moved back home I felt I wasn&amp;#39;t someone she liked anymore. Like I was just used to pass the time she was away from home. I only received deflections and how my comment hurt her. I was just shocked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made all of this worse is I had just helped this friend get a new pc with a good amount of money. Money I was anxious to spend but there were no issues in the friendship prior. We always worked things out we always played games and did voice chat. When she needed someone to vent to I tried to be there for her. I gave her advice helped her away from bad friends. Showed her how to be more positive and get through work. I put so much into it and I loved it. That friend felt like a sister to me that I didn&amp;#39;t have. Just like that though I was no longer even a thought to them. They said they would pay me back first. They ended up paying others back first. I asked them about it.

It's been 3 months since we broke up. This is really bad. My career is now struggling and it's very irresponsible of me to burden my teammates for personal reasons but i just can't function.

I think i need someone to push or coach me but realistically, I'm 26. There's no one to do that for me anymore. I'm an adult. 

I don't know how to go on. I miss her so much and i am incredibly lonely. I don't know who to seek and I don't want to go back to my old friends, after so long, just to let them hear me whine. It'll be as if i am only there when i need an emotional bolster.

I have already processed things and formed conclusions on how it wont work out if we were together and how she was not good for me. But this didn't help at all to making me miss her less, it only rationalised why i am here, not solve the pain. I also processed my shortfalls but my fear is the inability to grow from it and my current dysfunctionality is validating that fear. There are aspects in my life which were like this for a decade: where i couldn't grow in no matter how much i tried.

If this is one of those areas, I don't see anything good. I don't see how i can be fixed. It's looking very very bad.

,SuicideWatch,"my life has always been shit. everyone always told me that it'll get better someday but that never happened. I just hate my life so much, I hate myself, my environment and everything else too. I'm 20 (f) and have been depressed since I was 14, have very bad social anxiety ever since I could remember &amp; to top it off I am autistic. 

these days, the only thing that really makes me happy is smoking weed &amp; occasionally taking other drugs. I've just started a new job &amp; even though I'm proud of myself for finally doing something with my life (I graduated 3 years ago) I hate myself for being so stupid and anxious at work. I lay in bed all day, scrolling on tik tok or instagram, distracting myself from living. I don't have any friends &amp; I do have a boyfriend, but I'm not that happy when I'm with him either. besides work I don't do ANYTHING and it's frustrating me because I can't get myself to do anything. why am I so lazy?? I'm literally burnt out from doing nothing all day. I have a gym membership but I never go cause my anxiety is just way too high. 

I do hate my body &amp; I wish I could bring myself to go to the gym, but I don't eat enough. I even hate eating, it feels like a chore and nothing that I enjoy anymore. I hate how I look, especially my body, since I don't really eat much I'm way too thin and almost look sick. I've spent such a long time trying to love myself, at one point I just decided to give up. I feel like I am so ugly &amp; even though people tell me that I'm not, I'm so self conscious of myself. I feel like even how I'm walking is wrong, I hate my posture and my teeth, I hate how I dress &amp; I don't have any money to buy myself nice things. I compare myself to so many beautiful women online &amp; know that I'll never be happy with my looks. 
it doesn't matter how many times I change my hair, change my make up, my personality, I still always end up hating myself. 

I also have a pretty sad home life. both of my parents don't work, growing up we never had any money &amp; sometimes there wasn't even enough money for food. I have 5 siblings, 2 of whom I don't speak to. my parents have a lot of debt, even making debt in my name. as a child I also saw the police at home often, since my father did a lot of illegal things. at home it's always dirty, since my mom never cleans &amp; my siblings don't really care either. I'm the only one who's always cleaning, but I don't get appreciated &amp; I don't want to tidy up anymore. I would do anything to get out of here since I also have to share a room with my 2 sisters, but I don't have enough money. 

I don't have any hobbies, I hate everything and I regret not killing myself when I was 16 and still had the guts to do it. now I'm just slowly rotting away day by day. I wake up nauseous every day due to my anxiety, I've had sleeping problems since forever and I also have migraines almost everyday. I feel like my body will give up on its own slowly. 

I've tried finding my way to god, but I didn't feel better. I even tried manifestation and spirituality but nothing fucking works. I've tried waking up early, sleeping 8 hours or 4 hours is no difference, everyday I wake up tired of life. I want to go outside when I'm inside &amp; I always want to go home when I'm outside. I don't belong anywhere, I don't know who I am. everyday I look into the mirror and don't know who I'm looking at, it's like I'm a stranger to myself. I lost my teenage years to depression &amp; now I'm 20 and will never get those years back. I don't even know why I'm writing this right now, or if anyone will even read through this, but I just feel so alone and like life is a chore. 
maybe I should start therapy, but where I life it's impossible to find a therapist. I just want to life like everyone else, I don't want to be me anymore. I live in a constant state of stress, but I can't even cry anymore, I haven't cried in months even though I'm so miserable. 

I don't want to die, but I feel like I don't belong here. I feel like an outsider &amp; my autism only makes it harder for me to live. when I'll die someday, I hope everyone regrets how they treated me.

,SuicideWatch,"After the loss of a family member,  there was a lot of concern about my mental health and my risk for suicide, since I've had suicidal ideologies after leaving the military.

Prior, I spent a better part of a decade to get better and found solace in family, I've never been happier or as content with life less than a month ago.

When that all came crashing down, they tried to hide my guns and asked if I needed to go somewhere for awhile to sort myself out but I couldn't leave what was left of my family to grieve without me.

The guilt and regrets are eating me alive, I lost over 15lbs in 3 weeks, I hardly sleep anymore, the drugs make me have lucid dreams, so I quit them for my sanity, but I also want to dream of her in a better place.

Whatever 'faith' I had is gone, I realize that there isn't any Supreme being or heaven or a metaphysical place we all go to when we die.

I welcome this self destruction of myself, I deserve it, I failed, my life is meaningless in the grand scheme of things, I'm not going to cure cancer, I'm not going to be the  president of the United States, I'm just 1 of several billions and my mark on this world will be inconsequential. 

I did have one thing, one of the best things to ever happen to me is now gone and I can't think of how things can get better, because I had it all everything I ever dreamed of came true, I was happy and content and that's all gone now and there's nothing to gain or achieve anymore. My ambition was set and completed and I don't know if I can start over as there is nothing left to accomplish in my life. Nothing.

This is my first and I hope only boyfriend but I feel my own mental health struggles are causing a rift in our relationship. He has told me he resents me for the times i've gotten irrationally mad at him. I can see where he comes from and when i'm overstimulated or overwhelmed I don't handle it well, plain and simple I can be a bit of a b\*tch. On top of all this, my mood changes so rapidly he feels he has to walk on eggshells sometimes, I get in depressive moods which tell me that I don't deserve love and I don't deserve him. 

Further, I feel sometimes I wish i'd die or be murdered so he could let go of me (of a future with me) because all I want is for him to be happy. Although it would break me, its worth letting him go so he can be happier, more fulfilled, and appreciated in a relationship than he is now with me. I feel he deserves so much more than what I am giving him and I would die just to do that. I have told him on occasion these exact thoughts which has left him emotionally numb. I can tell that he has grown tired of this constant narrative of mine, he often tells me to ""just not"", and I sense I have caused him emotional trauma since he rarely and typically refuses to express his emotions with me anymore. 

I hold so much guilt for the pain I have caused him and I wish he would focus his attention towards someone more worthy of his unconditional love. 

I have gone to years of therapy on and off, I contextualize and intellectualize my emotions so much that I always feel multiple emotions at once in a given situation and fall into depressive patterns such as these whenever a stressor is present (intense uni schedule or narcissistic mom).

,SuicideWatch,"My cousin and I grew up together. We've been like siblings and best friends since we were young. I moved away to the United States and she went to a different city for University.
I came back this summer for vacation and we spent a few days together last week before she went back to school.
I could tell she was feeling down. She has lost a lot of weight since I saw her. I noticed she developed an ED and tried my best to make her eat more. 
Yesterday I went on Snapchat and saw her story she made about her healing journey from depression.
Turns out, she's been extremely depressed and self harming. According to her this is not the first attempt but the 32nd.
As I was scrolling through I felt like a failure for not recognising the obvious signs. And at the end of her story she said she relapsed again and goodbye for the last time.
She sent me s snap of her arm attached to an IV (I saw this before her Snapchat story) I called her several times she didn't pick up.
She just replied to me that she's hospitalised for attempt and that she'll call me later.

I have no idea what to say to her to help her. We are separated by cities and I don't think her parents know about it. I'm scared to tell them because it will feel like I'm breaking her trust and sharing something she doesn't want to share.

I understand her a little since I had multiple suicidal thoughts myself but never had the courage to go through with it.

,SuicideWatch,"I’m thinking of ending things tonight. I’ve struggled all my life with depression, I’ve worked through it with therapy and discovered coping mechanisms. 
But tonight is too much. I’ve worked through pain from childhood, long term relationship ending and my closest family member and best friend passing away. I spoke to my ex tonight, and have realised the love I felt for all those years was never reciprocated in the same way. One person who I thought really saw me for who I was, did, and decided I wasn’t enough.

I spoke to my ex tonight, and have realised the love I felt for all those years was never reciprocated in the same way. One person who I thought really saw me for who I was, did, and decided I wasn’t enough.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm going to kill myself and I'd like to post my suicide note here; I have it in writing but I'd like to have it somewhere where it is widely available to read. I'm really sorry and I wish things could be different. I really do.

To Whom It May Concern,

I'd like to start off by saying that what I end up doing was nobody's fault; this was the a decision that was the result of a lot of different factors. I will sum things up by saying that my life was not one that anyone would ever want to live. Sure, bad things happen to everyone--but I am inadequate. In every facet of existence I fall short of the mark. I have no talents, I am alone even when I'm around others, I have no drive to attempt things because I know that I will fail. I used to love writing (it is what is driving me to write this) but I have come to realize that this thing I loved was merely just a way to avoid the loneliness of my reality--the sadness that nothing will get better; I was just as bad at it as everything else unfortunately. I was not made for life. It is a strange statement, but one I know to be true. If I were anyone else I'd be happy and not writing this. Some people are given bad lives, but those people can overcome them and go on to have wonderful lives. I am not one of these people; once I drew that short straw my fate was sealed. Some people are just not meant to be born.

For awhile I thought things were getting better; in 2019 I had a job that I loved, friends that I cared for and that I believe cared for me, and a family situation that was pleasant enough. Right around this time, when things were looking up, the pandemic hit and things became the worst they'd ever been. My job (one in the medical field) fell into chaos and deteriorated my mental state further; eventually we were bought out and I had to quit. My mother also went missing around this time while camping and they have still not found a trace of her. In the aftermath of the pandemic my friends drew away from me and now it is as if I do not exist to them. I wanted to go to school, but this too the pandemic prevented. If this had not happened I think things could have been bearable for a little while longer.

Every day that I lived was a trail and I was always overcome with a sense of loneliness and despair. I felt that life was a prison and I didn't know how to escape or why I was even in this prison. Some people may ask what my problems were or offered advice, but this could never help in anyway because they could not understand what I feel every day--they did not have to endure the pain that life caused me. It was never about the problems--not at its core; these only served to heighten this pain. The only time I ever felt free was when I was sleeping, only there was I free of the pain, in my dreams. Dreams of a better existence, surrounded by people that wanted me around, of experiences I could never have in the waking world. My sleep was a reality of love, of warmth and belonging, and it is my hope that I'll return there in a more permanent capacity. That was the only place that my hopes were made manifest. You may not understand anything I'm saying, nothing I'm describing, and if that's the case then it is good news! Because you are not feeling what I am feeling and I am very glad for that.

I'm sure I sound crazy, but no therapist could have helped, even if I could have afforded it (which I could not). I understand the function of SSRIs and of the chemical imbalance that occurs in those with depression. I do not have depression, these medications would not have worked; what I had was a terminal outlook on life and a ceaseless soul-crushing anguish. There are people like me who cannot be helped, no matter how hard you try: it is an effort in futility. Please know that no amount of help could have changed my decision, and please do not blame yourselves for this, because it was well out of your control.

I could ask for your forgiveness, but a complete waste like me does not deserve it. I understand if you hate me, that is something I do deserve. I've tried to better myself, I've tried to help others, but nothing I do truly matters. I'm just so tired of everything. I know that I'm leaving a lot of stuff behind, just do with it as you please, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience that this causes you. For that, I am a horrible person.

Here's my original message:

I don't really feel like explaining my whole life story right now, just know it's really only getting worse.  To put it simply, I've lost basically all my friends.  I've lost my dog and my girlfriend.  My parents seem so unhappy with their lives as adults, and I really just don't enjoy life anymore.

On top of that, the world is a crazy shitshow and I really don't understand what the point in living is.  What great reason is there to go on?  For love?  I highly doubt with my mentally unstable self, I will ever find someone who loves me unconditionally.  For money? Yeah I ain't gonna be wealthy either, my parents are having a hard enough time just paying rent let alone groceries and helping me with school or trying to get me diagnosed and forget paying for any medication.  For fun? Nothings fun about this world.  Terrible people continue to run free from any guilt and any problems.  I've seen so many bad people get away with things and see no repercussions, and I try my best to be loyal and respectful to everyone (admittedly I fail for sure) but I try to be nice and I get the short end of the stick for trying to be a decent person.  

I'm convinced there's no good reason I should stay in this world, what logical sensical reasoning is there for enduring any more years of this?  I've lost so much and I don't want to throw myself a pity party, but everything's terrible.  My life has nothing going for it, no bright future, I'm not smart, I have a screwed up brain, living in a world where nobody cares about me, there's seriously no reason to keep going.

I don't know why I keep going, I guess part of me still has hope but I really think it would be better if I was dead.  The only ""enjoyment"" I get out of life is playing video games and half the time I don't even like playing games they're only a coping mechanism.  I always feel lonely no matter what anyone says.

I just don't know if I have the strength to wait that long.

I just want to go to college. I don't want to have kids, I don't want to have a house someday, I don't even dream of having a nice car. I just to want to pursue a PhD man

,SuicideWatch,"I feel very lonely, with no real activities apart from work. My debts consume most of my money. A year ago, the stress, depression, and frustration from not finding a job in my field despite having a degree, combined with the three-year struggle to get off a toxic job, the death tought who came back, and Hearing people complain about having a good life was difficult. I finally left a toxic job for a non-toxic that didn’t suit me. All of this piled up, and I cut off all contact. After three months, I received a few greetings and nothing more (six months later, one of them tried multiple times, but I didn't feel ready With my miserable life, I didn't want to reconnect until I had changed). I told myself that getting only two greetings in all that time showed I wasn't part of the group. most time ignored, I was more like a third wheel in a group of eight people for ten years (that's how I feel it).

Later, in November, a friend from another city came to mine and tried to get back on my feet. I engaged in activities, went out, tried dating apps, and had one date (I was super happy because, at my age (M27), it was my first date, despite many opportunities before). But the date was one-sided; she said yes but without enthusiasm, and I clung to it, seeking some love, though it was pointless. This improvement was short-lived. In January, I tried to enjoy my passion for photography, forced myself to improve, and reconnected with former colleagues and friends, though one had manipulative tendencies. I saw him as a male figure, in quotes. However, every time I posted a photo, he would call me on every platform possible (at least five calls), send messages everywhere, and leave comments. It was always to ask what was happening (related to the post). As an introvert, I didn’t like it; it made me feel watched 24/7. Another mistake I made was letting someone use my identity to find a job, adding stress at the end of each month because I didn't realize it would be automatically declared. So, I decided to cut connections, and since then, nothing. But my identity is still being used. A few days ago, I asked him via message to stop using it. He replied by sending an image and then deleting it before I could see it. I still have some hope because I changed my ID a few months ago, and the one he uses expires at the end of this month.

I already know that next year I'll owe taxes as if I were rich ( I prefer he stops using my ID and I pay the taxes than say it because if I do that I can lose everything, and I would probably need to fly away that country and never come back) while earning minimum wage with 28% of my salary going to debts each month. The government believes I earned double my actual salary because 2 minimum wages = rich enough. I have no contact with anyone; I feel alone. I have small projects and passions, but I can't motivate myself to pursue them. I wish I could succeed in motivating myself, stop putting myself in danger due to my altruism, make good friends and find a girlfriend in my city, and stop having failures like the rest of my life. I wanted to see a psychiatrist; I had one session but couldn't afford more. It put me in the red, and my employer's insurance is so poor that it doesn't cover what's usually reimbursed in my country, Im waiting for my refund so I can see my psychiatrist.

Every time I'm sad or angry, I remember all the times my mother told me I was useless, that I would never achieve anything, and that she hoped I would fail in life. All the time I stayed home because going out meant spending money for her. All the times I refused to go out with friends because I would be harassed on my phone ten minutes later, being told it was time to come home. Every time one of her acquaintances died, it was my fault. She even told me twice that I was worse than an accident worse than an unwanted, the worst thing that ever happened to her, and that she wished I had never existed. I knew I wasn't wanted but it was hard to hear that as a child, she bought me girls' stuff even though I am a boy. Ironically, she doesn’t like homosexuals! At one point, I believed I was a girl born in a boy's body(10\~\~14y). Around 15y, I started playing online games and met the group I cut off contact with last year. I desperately searched for a way to be loved, a way to forget, like adults drowning their sorrows in alcohol, but for me, it was in games.

I remember around 10 or 11, I wanted to end it. A friend at the time saw me and stopped me. Sometimes I think she shouldn't have intervened.

At 18, I left the country. After that, my mother would tell me she loved me and all, but she always had to remind me in every call that it was my fault for this, my fault for that. She also mentioned who would take care of her once she is too old (actually she is 66y) I suppose it will be my older brother (M38). My mother always called me by my brother’s name. I know she rarely called my brother by my name, but for me, it was all the time. My brother and I didn’t live together much; he lived with his father, and his life has also been pretty bad, but at least he is stronger than I am. And anyway, our last text was fine and you, fine thanks (mom and I).

My adult life has been socially challenging. I’ve made some good friends (they live abroad), but I know it has directly impacted my adult life.

In 2021, I hit a shallow point and played with a knife, wanting to stab myself but couldn't do it. I promised myself that if I couldn't improve my life by 30, I would end it all. I don't see the point of living if it’s only to continue being rejected everywhere, never succeeding in anything, and being alone.

I constantly live in the past and relive through my trauma every single day to the point that i can no longer take care of myself. i've been depressed for years and started self harming a decade ago, at 11 years old. i've been waiting for it to get better but it just seems to get worse. i've tried every single medication from SSRIS to mood stabilizers to antipsychotics to benzos to self medication with psychedelics and weed. The only thing that helped with the suicidal thoughts was the psychedelics for a few years but they turned into a dependency and i would not like to try them again. I've been in and out of therapy since i was 8. I am so suicidal and tired and feel so trapped that i do not care that anyone will miss me so please don't tell me to stay here for selfish reasons, they will eventually be fine. My boyfriend today said it would kill him and my family but my dad died a few years ago and life goes on whether you like it or not and it gets better dealing with grief.

I can't hold down a job and if i do i can't work for more than 3 days a week and i'm supposed to be going back to college this semester, i can't even take basic care of myself like remember to eat or drink water and my hair is matted because i don't have the energy to brush it. The only reason i will be okay tonight is because i am in my boyfriends bed and i will not let him the one to be finding my body. I've searched plans and every single one seems to have something wrong with it from organ failure to ending up in a coma/disabled. I do not have access to guns as i am legally not allowed to buy one in my state.

I constantly live in the past and relive through my trauma every single day to the point that i can no longer take care of myself. i&amp;#39;ve been depressed for years and started self harming a decade ago, at 11 years old. i&amp;#39;ve been waiting for it to get better but it just seems to get worse. i&amp;#39;ve tried every single medication from SSRIS to mood stabilizers to antipsychotics to benzos to self medication with psychedelics and weed. The only thing that helped with the suicidal thoughts was the psychedelics for a few years but they turned into a dependency and i would not like to try them again. I&amp;#39;ve been in and out of therapy since i was 8. I am so suicidal and tired and feel so trapped that i do not care that anyone will miss me so please don&amp;#39;t tell me to stay here for selfish reasons, they will eventually be fine. My boyfriend today said it would kill him and my family but my dad died a few years ago and life goes on whether you like it or not and it gets better dealing with grief. I just can&amp;#39;t seem to continue with my life anymore. I can&amp;#39;t hold down a job and if i do i can&amp;#39;t work for more than 3 days a week and i&amp;#39;m supposed to be going back to college this semester, i can&amp;#39;t even take basic care of myself like remember to eat or drink water and my hair is matted because i don&amp;#39;t have the energy to brush it. The only reason i will be okay tonight is because i am in my boyfriends bed and i will not let him the one to be finding my body. I&amp;#39;ve searched plans and every single one seems to have something wrong with it from organ failure to ending up in a coma/disabled. I do not have access to guns as i am legally not allowed to buy one in my state. No one seems to understand that i can&amp;#39;t crawl myself out of this state of despair and every time i try to explain it i am called lazy or that i am overthinking things when i have lived enough trauma for multiple lifetimes. Please just offer quick and easy convenient ways to die, i dont care how painful as long as it is quick. Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;

""I woke up In the morning and I didn't want anything, didn't do anything, couldn't do It anyway, just lay there listening to the blood rush through me and It never made any sense, anything.""

the sound of my breath, the feeling of my pulse, it's nauseating, all of it.

it's gnawing to exist.

i told my sister i was going to kill myself tonight, but she never responded. so i just deleted the messages to save myself the embarrassment.

i really am the scum of life, not even my own family wants to help me.

i'm so pathetic, i can't take living anymore.

i just want to feel okay again.

i want to listen to nirvana all day and sleep like a baby again. but lying down makes my ribs scrape against the insides my skin, piercing, and it's uncomfortable. 

so i haven't slept that much over these past days.

i feel so lightheaded all of the time, i just want it to stop already. 

i want to feel good, i want to go to school next month and be okay again. 

but i feel as if it's too late for me now.

14 years, yet It feels as If I have been alive for all eternity, excruciatingly.

it's harrowing to have to breathe to survive, to keep my blood pumping through my body, through the tips of my fingers.

i can't handle being this person anymore.

to live the life of a human being anymore.

no one, floating aimlessly through life without purpose or reason.

i'll extend my hand, but no one will take it,

to intertwine their fingers with mine, 

to tell me it'll all be okay again.

no one will bother to help me, no one no one no one.

am i really such a burden?

why must i be so hard to love, why was i born in the first place? nothing.

oh, what a shame it is to be me. i'll cry out against my existence, but i'll still be here. 

nothing, excruciating.

""I shall be nothing, the wind, the sky.""

the texture, the taste, the smell, no motivation, no incentive to do anything anymore.

as i am writing this, i feel so lightheaded, and it's unbearable to even breathe. 

such a strange feeling, to exist.

oppressing, harrowing, incomprehensible.

i feel my heart beat from the inside of my throat, and i feel sickened when i press my fingers against it, to feel it pulsate beneath.

i look into the mirror, and all that looks back is a person who has lost everything.

i miss having the luxury to enjoy life.

it's too late though. i feel too far gone. 

i can't find a reason to be much longer; no desire or hope to live, nothing but the blankness of death after.

""There's nothing worth pursuing at the cost of prolonging a life of suffering.""

i'm so scared of the pain though, that i'm starting to second-guess myself.

i hope it'll snap my neck. i don't want to have to die a slow and suffocating death.

that's what i fear the most, the pain that'll follow death.

why is it so hard to just die painlessly and instantly? 

what a pathetic life i have made for myself,

what a pathetic excuse of a human being.

i truly am nothing to this world.

 it's unbearable to think anymore, to feel anything at all anymore. 

excruciating, nothing.

i just want to fade out of existence so i won't have to think about anything anymore.

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wake me from this oxidizing world of a dream.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
